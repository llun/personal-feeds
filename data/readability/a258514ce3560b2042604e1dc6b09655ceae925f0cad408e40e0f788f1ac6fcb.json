Dupont settled for runner-up honors with Ewan taking third on the day. Stage 1 winner Miles Scotson finished safely in the bunch to retain his overall lead.</p><p></p><h3>Androni Giocattoli-Sidermec will race the Giro d’Italia as Vini Zabù withdraws</h3><p><strong>Vini Zabù</strong> has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/androni-giocattoli-will-race-the-giro-ditalia-as-vini-zabu-withdraws/\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawn</a> from the upcoming <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> following the second anti-doping rule violation by a team member within a 12-month period. <strong>Matteo De Bonis</strong> was notified in March of an adverse analytical finding for EPO in an out-of-competition test in February, while <strong>Matteo Spreafico</strong> returned two positive tests for Enobosarm (ostarine) during last year’s Giro.</p><p>Vini Zabù now faces a potential suspension of between 15 and 45 days, and on Thursday, the team withdrew from the Giro.
