What had happened on this quarter-mile stretch? Why here? It made me regret buying the rabbit, but without screeching to a halt on a frozen dual carriageway it wouldn’t have been practical to stop and collect them. Even at 70mph I could tell some were past their best and it’s rude to turn up empty-handed. I was on my way to visit Ted, so turning up with roadkill seemed to make sense. I was running late though and didn’t want to rely on road gifts so I picked up a wild rabbit wrapped in paper from our local butchers. It was a relief they had it because plan B was the pet shop.</p><p>I’d debated not going to visit Ted of <a href=\"https://www.tedjamesdesign.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ted James Design</a> and just compiling the stories people tell about him. The chronicles of SuperTed! The stories people tell can seem fairly fantastic, however, worryingly most of the time they’re true. I sometimes wonder how Ted is even alive? If I were more superstitious, I’d say his spirit was too big for his body and so it spends all of its time trying to get out. There’s something in his eyes like the sort of superintelligence and frustration a sheepdog has about being domesticated, as though any room that he’s in is somehow too small, so his eyes dance about searching for exits.<span id=\"more-206027\"></span></p><blockquote><p>“One time on his way home from a late shift in the workshop, he fell off his motorbike into a ditch, he had to work early the next morning so he decided the ditch wasn’t that bad, so he slept in the ditch and then wheeled his bike back to work in the morning”. “On the first few ESB frames, he bent the chainstays with his hands!”. “One time Ted picked up a deer he found in the road, and put it in his car, and then it exploded.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Chris king walks into a bar, takes one look at a drunken half-naked Ted swinging wild punches in an invisible bar brawl, spins 180 on the spot, and disappears.” “Once Ted dropped a lathe on himself, and had to cut his trousers off”.</p></blockquote><p>80% of the chronicles of SuperTed involve superhuman interactions and/or near-death experiences with lathes. There are a lot of stories about Ted that are probably true, so I definitely shouldn’t write about them. Ted was one of the people who taught me how to build frames, but before that our paths had crossed a few times. Outside of bike shows, I’ve not really hung out with Ted, so I took the opportunity to go and have a nose around and do some riding in the woods.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>I rolled into Ted’s workshop on a rural industrial estate in Gloucestershire at around three in the afternoon, to find him mixing paint.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m not sure if I should add more yellow?”</p><p>“I don’t know?

It being November in the UK, we missed the sunset, but I did get to take a look at Ted’s new bike.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_87.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_89.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><blockquote><p>“How long have you been riding this thing?”</p><p>“I was building one for Mike Bennet from Fingers Crossed and so I built this one at the same time…I’ve had it for a few months now.”</p><p>“It’s stainless?”</p><p>“Yea I built a 953 frame for Reynolds for the mountain bike testing, then after all the stress testing the frame was just lying about in the workshop so I used the tubes”</p><p>“There can’t be much butt left on those tubes?”</p><p>“No, I had to make it a bit longer than I wanted, and it’s only 0.5 wall at the seat tube and 0.8 at the head tube which is super thin.

There are a lot of people who obviously aren’t keen on it. The funny thing is that modern BMX, like modern park riding and stuff, is far removed from the origins of BMX and where BMX has come from. These bikes are more BMX than anything else. BMX is bicycle motor cross and so the bikes imitate motor cross bikes. I think people would have a much worse reaction if Ruben Alcantara and Garett Byrnes weren’t building suspension bikes. They’re amazing riders and they’ve been riding these bikes and they find the suspension pretty good for old bodies”</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_107.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>I mean – I guess it makes sense? Why don’t people build suspension BMX bikes?</p><blockquote><p>“People have tried to make it before but it hasn’t really worked. Probably because the suspension was shit. Even on mountain bikes when suspension came in, in the 90’s suspension wasn’t any good, it was ages before it was worth having. It’s 2” longer than normal and the head angle is really slack so it feels shit to ride around a car park, but riding it round the woods it just feels normal. You can ride it on trails where you can’t normally ride a BMX, but it’s different from a mountain bike because it’s small. You don’t have a big tyre buzzing up your arse, and you can throw it around a bit more underneath you. It’s such a good feeling! There are loads of wall rides ‘n’ stuff that I couldn’t do before because the runup was too rough or they needed too much digging, so I had to do them on a mountain bike. But I don’t want to do them on a mountain bike. I want to do them on a BMX and now I can.”</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_106.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>No one HAS TO do a wallride!</p><p>Ted does some tricks, (I didn’t play enough tony hawk as a kid to know what the tricks are called) I take some pictures, It’s dark, so we ride back to the car.</p><blockquote><p>“The bikes you have in your car are essentially a track-themed mountain bike and a BMX-themed mountain bike?”</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_103.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Ted explains:</p><blockquote><p>“they’re multipurpose bikes. On the gravel/track bike you can put slick tyres and a mech hanger on and it’s a road bike. I’ve made some screw on bosses for the cables, but you can also ride it round the trails, and the BMX you can just change the fork and the tyres on”</p></blockquote><p>The third bike in the car is one that I built, however not entirely. It was adapted from a box of mitered tubes that were meant to be one of Teds ESB frames. It too is a multipurpose bike, having various things. A 5-speed town bike with half a cassette, a fixie with 622 x 2.2” tyres, and in its current guise as my everyday everything bike with a chubby Schwalbe G-one on the back and a knobbly fat 20” front on a Clydesdale fork upfront. Although its production was pretty limited, there are a lot of ESB frames being ridden out there, and the people who ride them, love them. It has to be one of my top five production bikes I’ve ever ridden. Like all good bikes, I bought one, rode it, sold it, regretted that for a few years, then got my hands on another. Hilariously, Ted is in the same position having sold his personal bike because it was quicker and easier than building a new one, he bought another second hand only to sell that one later for the same reason. He now wishes he still had an ESB.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_80.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_71.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>The ESB (which stands for Extra Strong Bike) was born of the fixie scene of the mid 2000’s. At the time it was dubbed a “trick fixie” however it’s held up over the years as a multipurpose bike, because of its generous tyre clearances and conservative geometry as well as its reputation for being bombproof. Over the years, Ted has put together a huge number of extremely refined and exceptional bikes from the almost hyper-conservative to the fantastically experimental and the immaculately detailed and presented. I remember being almost giddy at the idea of chatting to Ted about his 29gnar which was a 29er that could be ridden fixed or single speed, and then be ridden geared with the addition of an easily removable frame-mounted gearbox. At one point he made business cards that had a picture of the bike he made for his Mum on them. It was a super slick “rando” (hybrid) bike with internal routing, dynamo lights and mudguards, which was in stark contrast to the sweet fixie and gnarly mountain bike builds he was known for. In a way that’s what is interesting about Ted’s work; bikes are bikes and he can make them all very well.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Frame builders who machine their own frame components and can get excited by frame repairs are just a very different fish. They’re much fewer and farther between than makers of slick road and gravel bikes. It’s tricky to describe exactly how and why this work is valuable in a world of side-by-side comparisons, but it somehow makes every build more coherent and rational. Like the bikes are born not made. Ted thinks. No one has ever seen him do it, but snippets of excellent design just keep coming. I remember spending weeks trying to get some pretty tight bends into 0.8 wall 1 1/5” T45 tubes which were super tricky, and being frustrated at how stiff and thin the material was. A few weeks later, Ted casually turned up to a bike show with a frame made entirely from 953 stainless tubes that he’d profiled somehow into dodecahedrons. Even with his remarkable back catalogue of insane builds that hinge on what seems like an intuitive understanding of metallurgy, the ESB stands out as an incredibly well thought out and utilitarian design.</p><p>At one point I flirted with the idea of designing a bike to be manufactured- I guess that’s a pipe dream that a lot of builders share. My search led me to a stash of notched tubes in a container that at one time, were destined to become 14 Bike Co. ESB frames, that had been abandoned and left to rust. I asked Ted, “Why didn’t you buy them? Surely, they wouldn’t take any time to weld up and paint. People still want ESB’s; I have one that I love and you want one. I guess they’re a bit rusty now?”. “Yea, they’re all rusty and I was always broke, also they’re a huge distance away and they have no interest in delivering them.” Always being broke kind of feels like a bit of a double-edged sword, especially in relation to Ted and the bikes that he builds. It’s the best possible mindset in building multipurpose bikes. As uncomfortable as it is, it forces experimentation and refinement of process, and best of all it puts the focus on bikes that ride better and are better. “I don’t care about making perfect looking bikes. Loads of people make perfect looking bikes and it just takes so much more time. I just want to make bikes that ride really well.” Every one of Ted’s bikes that I’ve ridden has been an absolute joy, but aside from that, he’s designed some pretty exceptional components to be made efficiently in house with manual machines. Having machined headtubes out of solid material on a contract basis for Reynolds, he now has his own headtube cups which share many of the benefits but can be made more efficiently in-house at a fraction of the cost. His through-axle dropouts are hydro cut to shape and then manually machined, using the mech hanger as the thread, so that when the wheels are off the rear mech can also come off easily to avoid being damaged in transit.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Ted pours a generous whiskey into a bit of stainless steel from a pile next to the lathe and sets it down next to me.

They didn’t sell bikes you could buy in a shop though, instead the window was full of immaculately laid out lugs, tubes, and shiny bits of imported NJS aluminium.

They knew that we were selling bikes round the corner, and they told us that they were going to start selling bikes, so instead of working against each other, we worked together. They didn’t know anything about bikes but they had the shop. It was pretty good; they were making money off of me, but I was getting loads of work so it kind of worked.”</p><p>“That’s a pretty good situation?”</p><p>“Yea but they were making loads of money selling t-shirts and losing money selling bikes so it didn’t really work.

I just didn’t want to sleep indoors.”</p></blockquote><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-120.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>We scraped the ice off the car, jump started it and headed towards some local trails. It was a dreamy ride, loading film into the Kiev while, listening to Ted describe the local landscape and trails in incredible detail with George Greenough’s film “crystal voyager” playing in the background. We stopped by an insanely rough dry stone wall ride, and an old quarry full of lumps and bumps where a suspension BMX seemed like the only logical bike. After some jumping and sliding about, cold, exhausted and hungry we headed back to the workshop. I was glad I’d packed a tin of sandwiches as the daylight revealed how raw what was left of the rabbit carcass we had been gnawing on in the night was. It turns out you can eat raw rabbit. Ted tried to convince me that pasta and peanut butter were a good combo. We looked at some dropouts, and a customer came to collect some wheels. As Ted headed out to collect his kids from school, I sat back in my car with the heater on until I could feel my fingers before heading home. When people say “Ted’s an animal” I don’t think they mean what they’re saying, and at the same time I don’t think they know how right they are for all the wrong reasons.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/ted-james_110.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Ted IS an animal, which isn’t to say that he’s subhuman. It’s the opposite, it’s like he’s the product of millions of years of evolution to be more perfectly suited to his habitat. People have to learn bicycles, but in the world of bicycles, Ted is an apex predator.</p></div></div>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"3c70ee8db92f912297eb3348ddca74f2faf3de334365835b198e88feb803f1da","category":"Cycling"}
