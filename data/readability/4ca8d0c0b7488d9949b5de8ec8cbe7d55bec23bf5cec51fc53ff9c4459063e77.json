href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2015/05/21/cross-over-full-face-ixs-introduces-the-xult-enduro-dh-helmet/\">original Xult</a> was billed as a crossover enduro to downhill full face helmet at a light for the times 1100g. iXS said the idea was to provide gravity-ready full face safety that could be ridden up the hill for Enduros, then down the other side like a DH helmet.&nbsp;In the years since, there’s been a boom in lightweight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=full+face\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full-face helmet protection</a> – great for everyone from aggressive all-mountain and enduro riders, up to full-bore DH racers.</p><p>But now that iXS has the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/08/20/ixs-trigger-ff-squeezes-in-with-lightest-full-face-helmet-at-600g/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ultralight 600g Trigger FF</a> in-mold full-face (<em>at a quite reasonable 250€</em>) for those rides that involve pedaling up, the Xult doesn’t need to cross-over anymore. It can stick with gravity riding only, while also opening up a bit for better ventilation and shedding almost 10% of the weight off the original – not to overlook 15% off the original’s price tag!</p><h3>Gravity Protection – Tech details</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top.jpg\" alt=\"iXS Xult DH full face helmet, lightweight downhill race protection,&nbsp;top\" width=\"1250\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top.jpg 1250w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-297x214.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-800x576.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-120x86.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-768x553.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-696x501.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-1068x769.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-583x420.jpg 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top.jpg 1250w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-297x214.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-800x576.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-120x86.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-768x553.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-696x501.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-1068x769.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29145752/iXS-Xult-DH-full-face-helmet-lightweight-downhill-race-protection_top-583x420.jpg 583w\"></a></p><p>Engineered to protect riders &amp; racers descending technical DH tracks, freeride trails &amp; bikeparks, the new Xult DH gets a new lightweight Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) shell – a material composite iXS calls “an environmentally friendly alternative to carbon which requires less material”.
