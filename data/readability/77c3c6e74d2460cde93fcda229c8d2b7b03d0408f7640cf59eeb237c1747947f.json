But users who want to run Windows on the Mac are officially and natively&nbsp;left&nbsp;out in the cold.</p><p>Admittedly, those of us who run Windows on a Mac are a distinct minority of the community. I run Windows 10 quite a bit on my iMac for professional reasons (and sharper small fonts), and the M1 Mac's lack of Boot Camp support seemed to be a non-starter for me. And after witnessing the M1’s scintillating performance in the testing for this article, I was not happy about it in the least.</p><p>Fortunately, the situation is far from hopeless.

It’s hardly like running Windows natively via Boot Camp, but it’s not half-bad with native ARM apps.</p><p>Alas, Windows on the Mac involves a slew of \"ifs\" and \"maybes.\" Primarily, there is no guarantee that Microsoft will acquiesce to make Windows 10 for ARM (the required OS) available to end-users. I’m guessing the company eventually will, given the rather upbeat moods of the participants I queried. But who knows?

Thanks to unified direct-access memory, integrated GPU cores, and cores dedicated to common tasks (such as H.265 video encoding), it’s fast as all get out.</p><p>But its most surprising trick is running x86/x64 Mac apps at more than acceptable (if not quite native) speeds. It's faster than my 2015 iMac with an Intel Core i7. This is partly due to the Rosetta 2 install time translation (or requested), but Apple doused the M1 with some of what I call \"special sauce\"—sly tricks that include support for x86 memory ordering, one of the main differences between Intel and ARM architectures.</p><p>ARM is hardly new. It’s in nearly every mobile phone, most portable devices, TVs, and more, though under licenses that allow the vendors to call their ARM implementation anything they want. Even Microsoft has supported ARM for quite a while, first with Windows RT (8.1/32-bit ARM), and now with Windows 10 for ARM.&nbsp;</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_68fb5a2d630a0c28d2f732515ccf05e1\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01eydr6f7v8cf5g3sdjvb6zgr9\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/01/arm-processor-samsung_6-header-1240x820-100874884-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Samsung</div>\n<p>Though called by many names (if you pay enough money, you can call your ARM processors anything you want), much of the world runs on ARM.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"arm processor samsung 6 header 1240x820\" width=\"1200\" height=\"794\" data-imageid=\"100874884\" data-license=\"Supplied Art\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/01/arm-processor-samsung_6-header-1240x820-100874884-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/01/arm-processor-samsung_6-header-1240x820-100874884-large.jpg\"></a><small>Samsung</small><figcaption><p>Though called by many names (if you pay enough money, you can call your ARM processors anything you want), much of the world runs on ARM.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The full Windows 10 for ARM is currently available only to OEMs, while end users must make due with a beta on the company’s Windows Insider Preview site.

However, emulation can be&nbsp;<em>very</em> slow. Unless Microsoft rewrites that code to take somehow take advantage of Apple’s special sauce, you’ll never be able to run heavy-duty x86/x64 Windows apps with acceptable performance on Apple’s M1.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether Microsoft is considering optimizing for the M1 is something I asked the company about, with no direct answer forthcoming. However, there’s an<a href=\"https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-test-windows-10-arm-insider-on-m1-macs/7082dca1-f70c-4986-a73f-4770a11c86d4?auth=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">&nbsp;article</a>&nbsp;on Microsoft’s Answer site about running the Windows 10 for ARM preview on M1 Macs. Hmmm.</p><p>Would Apple then relent and implement Boot Camp? I inquired of them about that and several other things. The answer is still no, and I expect that it will remain that way with Apple’s current savage pursuit of security, but it was actually Apple that pointed me to the aforementioned <a href=\"https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-test-windows-10-arm-insider-on-m1-macs/7082dca1-f70c-4986-a73f-4770a11c86d4?auth=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Answer article</a>. More evidence of the decidedly non-hostile attitudes towards Windows on M1 that I sensed from both parties.&nbsp;</p><p>M1 optimization of Windows 10 for ARM isn’t quite as far-fetched an idea as it might seem. Recent drama in the valley has more or less let the cat out of the M1 bag.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Days of Our Lives, Silicon Valley style</h2><p>Said big cat is one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-loses-engineer-overseeing-the-processors-powering-iphones-ipads/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerard Williams III</a>, who until quite recently was the chief of all of Apple’s ARM CPU efforts. He strayed from Apple to form a company called <a href=\"https://nuviainc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nuvia</a> that works on—yup, you guessed it—CPU designs. There’s a <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/12/10/apple-suing-former-iphone-chip-designer-for-breach-of-contract\" rel=\"nofollow\">lawsuit</a> in progress over this.</p><p>But wait, there’s more. The real stunner is Qualcomm, a huge supplier of ARM-based chips, entering into an <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/01/13/qualcomm-acquire-nuvia\" rel=\"nofollow\">agreement</a> to purchase fledgling Nuvia. Ouch. If Apple isn’t just a tiny bit upset over this development, dye my hair red and call me Harpo.&nbsp;</p><p>The legal battles might be protracted and vicious, but the bottom line is that Apple’s M1 magic might not be secret or proprietary for nearly as long as the company would’ve liked. What the patent situation is, I don’t know, but clever reverse engineering is another plentiful Silicon Valley skill.</p><p>If other ARM chips that handle x86/x64 as well as the M1 show up, then Microsoft would have to suffer a true bout of idiocy not to optimize for it. Even if the method isn’t 100 percent the same (as is likely), it’s bound to take the same approach, which renders optimizing for Apple’s special sauce a mere bagatelle.</p><p>Who knows, Apple might decide it’s not such a bad thing to let Windows run natively on their hardware again. Personally, because of the security mission I mentioned, I’m not sanguine about that possibility.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also a side-door for Windows 10 for ARM that Apple’s switch to the architecture has opened, potentially rendering the entire issue moot: more vendors porting their apps to ARM. Apple ARM to Windows ARM is a heck of a lot easier than x86 to ARM.</p><p>The wildest idea I had through all of this was Apple all of a sudden deciding the gig is up and selling some of their design secrets to the competition. Or heaven forbid, actual chips. Nah, but It’s an interesting thought.</p><p>Personally, I’m pessimistic about Boot Camp, but mildly hopeful that at some point, Apple’s strategy of advanced virtual machine support, and Microsoft taking advantage of the secret sauce will deliver more than acceptable Windows 10 performance on M1 Macs. Even with x86/x64 apps. Which is an absolutely golden opportunity for...</p><h2>Parallels to the rescue</h2><p>Parallels Desktop for Mac, if you’re not familiar, is the insanely integrated virtual machine software from Parallels. The ability to run Windows apps on the Mac desktop, files and folders that automatically sync between both desktops, plus other integrations, raise it several tiers above VMWare, VirtualBox and the like for the Mac.

Its primary advantages are that it’s free and open source. The main disadvantage is that it must be installed, configured, and run from the Terminal command prompt.
