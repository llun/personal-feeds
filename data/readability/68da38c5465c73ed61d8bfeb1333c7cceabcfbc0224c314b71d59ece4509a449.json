Background tabs no longer wake up the CPU as often and preserve battery life, and as a result, Chrome uses up to 5x less CPU, while battery life is up to 1.25 hours better, says Google.</p><p>According to the developers, since its introduction in Chrome 87 and wider rollout in Chrome 88, the feature has been responsible for a 65% improvement on Chrome's Apple Energy Impact score for pages in the background.</p><p>The highlighted improvements are in stark contrast to recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/20/chrome-safari-ram-test/\">independent tests</a> which claimed to demonstrate that Google Chrome uses 10x more RAM than Safari on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a>.</p><p>While the independent measurements have been <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26179817\">contested</a>, separately Apple claims that Safari on ‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌ is \"50% faster on average at loading frequently visited websites than Chrome.\" Apple also says Safari can stream video for up to one and a half hours longer, and can keep users browsing normally on a single charge for up to one hour longer, compared to Chrome and Firefox.</p><p>Google Chrome for Mac is a free download available directly from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Google's servers</a>. <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/utilities/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> for iOS is a free download for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
