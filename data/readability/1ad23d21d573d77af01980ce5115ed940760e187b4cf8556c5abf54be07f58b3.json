I recently bought myself the Lezyne Strip Drive Pro, a mid-priced rear light that’s the equal-brightest option in the company’s extensive range. It’s impressed me enough that I thought I’d share it.&nbsp;</p><p>Lezyne claims the Strip Drive Pro offers a peak output of 300 lumens, and while I don’t have the measuring equipment to confirm this, I can confirm that the five LEDs pack a punch that can be seen from a long way away (and with surprisingly good side visibility, too). My usual go-to rear light is a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2016/12/ten-products-i-loved-in-2016-david-rome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previous-generation Bontrager Flare R</a>, and the Lezyne Strip Drive Pro is noticeably more blinding to look at.</p><p>In its brightest day-flashing mode the light is claimed to last for just three hours, while less-bright settings will go noticeably longer. There are a total of 11 modes, and while that feels like too many when you’re clicking through them, the light thankfully remembers and reverts to the mode you last used.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>First released in 2019, the Strip Drive Pro recently received a small refinement that moved it from an integrated USB stick to a more traditional cable-based Micro USB port for charging. This port is sealed by a large rubber cap that provides a robust seal and a reassuring “pop” when opening.&nbsp;</p><p>Most often it’s the mounting bracket that lets down otherwise good lights, but thankfully Lezyne has kept things simple with a strong co-moulded build that’s held in place with a replaceable band strap (an 0-ring could be used, too). The light angle is fixed and, strapped in place, it retains a narrow 36 mm profile that avoids leg rub.</p><p>The rubber backing is flexible and deep, shaped to handle both skinny aero seatposts and regular round posts, and included is a rubber chock/wedge for use on flat-backed seatposts (D-shaped). In my experience, the light fits best with seatpost shapes that don’t require this wedge. There is no angle adjustment available.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Lezyne also offers this light with an “Alert” feature which uses an accelerometer to brighten the light upon sudden braking. This feature adds US$5 / AU$10.</em></p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 62 g (with mounting strap)<br><strong>Price:</strong> US$55 / AU$90<br><strong>More info:</strong> <a href=\"https://ride.lezyne.com/collections/led-lights-rear/products/strip-drive-pro\">ride.lezyne.com</a>&nbsp;</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1ad23d21d573d77af01980ce5115ed940760e187b4cf8556c5abf54be07f58b3","category":"Cycling"}
