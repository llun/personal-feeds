Today, Adam shares his experience and details by highlighting what you as an attendee can expect from a <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Smashing Workshop</a>, and things to keep in mind when running one.</section></p><p>It took me around six months on and off to write the content for the workshop. After a lot of deliberation, I decided to structure it like I do in my book, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/\">Form Design Patterns</a>.</p><p>It was a 4-day workshop split into two 45-minute segments, with 15-minute breaks followed by a 30-minute Q&amp;A with optional homework between days. Each day we set out to solve one big problem. This provided a way to approach the problem like we do in real life: by analyzing and discussing the options before arriving at a good solution.</p><p>Overall, it was a fun experience. I learned a lot and had a great time teaching and chatting with everyone. I’m already looking forward to the next one which is tentatively planned for Summer 2021.</p><h3 id=\"some-of-the-highlights-of-each-day\">Some Of The Highlights Of Each Day</h3><p>Here’s a quick rundown of each day including some of the highlights.</p><h4 id=\"day-1-nailing-the-basics-of-form-design\">Day 1: Nailing The Basics Of Form Design</h4><p>On the first day, we designed a simple registration form from scratch. This provided a perfect way to nail the basics of form design. It covered things like <strong>label positioning</strong>, form styling and input types. At the end of day 1, we had ourselves a registration form that covered the basics and made the form as simple as possible for users.</p><p>My highlight of this session was the <strong>question protocol</strong> exercise. Instead of focusing on how to artificially save space on forms (by using things like float labels, tooltips, left-aligned labels and placeholder text), we used a spreadsheet to help know why every question is being asked and the best way to elicit the answer.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"Question protocol spreadsheet\"></a><figcaption>The question protocol spreadsheet to understand why every question is being asked and the best way to elicit the answer (<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e6dd98c-2cae-430a-8ad7-56eb8c2fe86b/question-protocol-form-design-masterclass.png\">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>For our registration form, this meant a thorough analysis of asking for someone’s name, email address and password.

The group asked him questions to work out why the form was designed the way it was and asking why certain questions were asked.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"The Smashing Magazine membership registration form\"></a><figcaption>The Smashing Magazine membership registration form (<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9fab25b-a340-4137-a836-6bf86b94ba4d/smashing-form-design-masterclass.png\">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/sssoz\">Sophy O</a> asked why the <strong>country field</strong> is being asked for. Vitaly said that it depends on what the user is doing. If the user is buying a book, we need to know where it’s going. And the taxes on the book are based on the destination country.’ This resulted in either removing the field and asking for this information when someone buys the book — or just being clearer in hint text about why we’re asking for this information.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nishville.com/\">Milos Lazarevic</a> questioned the need for the ‘Do you like cats?’ checkbox. And Dana Cottreau and <a href=\"https://jaclynziegler.com/\">Jaclyn Ziegler</a> enjoyed the <strong>playfulness of the checkbox</strong>. But I would weigh up the joy it brings some people against the risk of alienating people who are, for example, less digitally savvy or are simply in a rush to access the content.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/emmastotz\">Emma Stotz</a> questioned the use of <strong>live validation</strong> given all the <a href=\"https://adamsilver.io/blog/live-validation-is-problematic/\">usability issues</a> that pop up around that. And Vitaly was keen to explore instantly validating the fields on submit instead.</li></ul><h3 id=\"my-overall-impression\">My Overall Impression</h3><p>For me, the workshop went very well overall and I was chuffed with the way things went and the feedback I received from the attendees. Everyone was so friendly, and tolerant of a couple of technical difficulties I had on the first day (<em>thanks again, everyone!</em>). Running the workshop remotely over Zoom has its problems (we won’t talk about how I accidentally left the meeting in a panic by accident on day 1), but actually I found the <strong>remote aspect</strong> useful on the whole.</p><p>For example, all being connected to Zoom, meant it was seamless for attendees to ask questions while <strong>sharing their screen</strong> to bring the problems to life.</p><p>I also really enjoyed <strong>meeting people</strong> across the world, something that would have been difficult with in-person workshops I think. Also, during the break, I got to quickly dash to put my kids to bed, so I imagine that also worked well for the attendees, too.</p><p>But there’s one thing I wish I knew earlier. I was worried, that with such a large group of people (81 to be exact), letting people talk freely would end up in a chaos. As a result, on day 1, I read out and answered group’s questions from the shared Google Doc during the Q&amp;A. This meant that other people’s voices weren’t heard and there was more of a barrier between me and the group.</p><p>This is something I rectified for day 2 and it really made a difference. It was nice to <strong>hear people’s voices</strong> and thoughts in their own words and it created more of an open dialogue where other people started to answer other people’s questions which I loved.</p><p>I remember Alex Price jumping in once to talk about his experience in dealing with a complicated form that needed to be completed by different people.</p><h3 id=\"what-i-ll-change-for-next-time\">What I’ll Change For Next Time</h3><p>While my overall impression of the workshop was very positive, there were some things I’d look to improve for next time.</p><h4 id=\"1-show-the-basics-not-learn-the-basics\">1. Show The Basics, Not Learn The Basics</h4><p>Day 1 covered a lot of the basics before going into greater detail on the following days, but it bothered me a bit to teach some of these things as I thought many attendees knew a lot of this stuff already. So next time I’d like to acknowledge that some people have come with a lot of knowledge and set the scene as ‘this is how I teach the basics’ as opposed to ‘this is how to learn the basics’ — thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cjforms\">Caroline Jarrett</a> for this tip.</p><p>Also, I’ll probably ask the group if there’s any form design approach that they’ve <strong>struggled to convince</strong> teammates about as that’s certainly something I’ve struggled with before.</p><h4 id=\"2-split-people-up-in-bigger-groups\">2. Split People Up In Bigger Groups</h4><p>One of the exercises involved people splitting up into groups of 2 using the Zoom breakout rooms, but because people came to this workshop from all over the world, some of the people listening were not able to take part in the exercises.</p><p>For example, some people really needed to take a lunch break because their time zone was ahead of mine. This meant one or two people who did want to participate found themselves in a group on their own. Next time, I’d put people into groups of say 4 and make sure the exercises still work.</p><h4 id=\"3-add-more-group-exercises\">3. Add More Group Exercises</h4><p>Despite the issue I just mentioned, the <strong>group exercises</strong> worked well. People enjoyed them, and it sparked some really interesting ideas from the participants. Some people messaged me after saying that they wished there were more group exercises, so I’ll aim to do just that.</p><h3 id=\"a-poster-of-all-the-rules\">A Poster Of All The Rules</h3><p>As we moved through the workshop, we ticked off over <strong>40 rules and principles of form design</strong> which brought a nice additional structure to the sessions.</p><p>A few of the attendees asked me if I had a poster of all the rules and I didn’t — so now I’ve made one.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"1132\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19a44f71-893f-4af0-a6b2-56139b720e7f/poster-form-design-masterclass.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"All 42 rules from the workshop captured in a handy poster\"></a><figcaption>All 42 rules from the workshop captured in a handy poster.
