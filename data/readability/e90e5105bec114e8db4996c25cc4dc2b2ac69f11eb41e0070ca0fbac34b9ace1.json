In a tweet responding to <em>MacRumors</em> editor Joe Rossignol's commentary on a possible March event, Gurman confirmed that the March 16 date is not correct.</p><p>In a separate tweet, he said \"launch isn't on the 16th,\" which leaves open the possibility for a March event on a different date.</p><p>Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upcoming-apple-products/\">several products in the works</a> that have been rumored for the first half of 2021, including a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, an updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, a new low-cost AirPod, revamped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3, plus we're still waiting on the debut of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>.</p><p>Some of these products could indeed be introduced at a spring event, but there is no known date for that event as of yet. Apple does hold March events in most years, but it's not guaranteed. Past spring events have been held on March 9 (2015), March 21 (2016), March 27 (2018), and March 25 (2019), with no event taking place in March 2017 or March 2020.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
