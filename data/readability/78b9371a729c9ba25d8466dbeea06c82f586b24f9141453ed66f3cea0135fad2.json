But once you’re finished and just before you merge your work into a team branch, it’s probably a good idea to hold on for a moment and just take a breath. Look at the <strong>commit history</strong> you’ve produced along the way and see if it could be improved: is it easily understandable? Are there commits that should actually <em>not</em> be included? Two commits that should be combined into one? Or a huge monster of a commit that should be broken up into smaller, more readable commits?</p><p>Cleaning up your commits before you integrate them into a team branch is important when we want to maintain a healthy code base. And Git’s <strong>“Interactive Rebase”</strong> tool is the perfect way to get there.</p><p>Interactive Rebase allows you to delete commits, rearrange them, combine multiple commits into one, or split up a big commit into multiple smaller ones.

Managing these modules in an elegant, pragmatic way greatly helps to reduce headaches!</p><p>In theory, you could simply copy and paste the necessary code files into your project and then commit them to your code base. But this comes with a couple of downsides. Most importantly, you’ll have a very hard time <strong>updating third-party code</strong> when new versions become available. You’d have to download the code again and copy-paste it — again and again.</p><p>Additionally, it’s considered bad practice if you squeeze multiple projects (your actual project and all the third-party libraries you might need) into a single Git repository. This mixes external code with our own, unique project files.</p><p>A much better way to do this is to use Git’s <strong>“Submodule” structure</strong>: this allows you to include third-party code simply as a Git repository inside your actual project’s Git repository. This means that all code bases remain neatly separated.</p><p>Including a third-party module / library is as easy as executing the following Git command:</p><p>This command will download a clone of the specified Git repository into your project. You’ll be left with a fully-functional, nicely separated Git repository of your third-party code. Tidy, clean and flexible.</p><p>Submodules, admittedly, are quite a complex topic when it comes to handling them in practice. If you want to understand them a bit more thoroughly, check out the “<a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/desktop-gui/advanced-topics/submodules/\">Submodules</a>” chapter of the free “Learn Version Control with Git” online book.</p><h3 id=\"composing-commits-with-precision\">Composing Commits With Precision</h3><p>There’s a golden rule in version control: <strong>a commit should only contain changes from a single issue!</strong> When you stick to this rule, you will create commits that are easy to understand. When you don’t — when multiple issues and topics get crammed into the same commit — you will inflict chaos on your code base in almost no time.</p><p>In practice, this means that you <strong>create separate commits for each and every topic</strong>. Even if it’s just a small bug fix where you’re changing only a semicolon: it’s a topic of its own, so it gets a commit of its own!</p><p>But in the messy real world, we often don’t <em>work</em> at only one topic at a time. Or we think we do, and only later discover that our code from the last three hours actually involves three different topics.
