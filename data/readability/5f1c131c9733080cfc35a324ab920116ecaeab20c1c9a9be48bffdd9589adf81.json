Over the past few years, we did see the ‌HomePod‌ drop down to between $150 and $200 during holiday sales, with $199 being one of the most popular discount prices since 2018.</p><p>Of course, now that it's discontinued, we'll never see these sale prices again and you'll have to pay full price (or more) if you really want to purchase the original ‌HomePod‌ in 2021.</p><p><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.
