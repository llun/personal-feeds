The dual SIMD units, support for int8 and fp16 instructions, and other architectural improvements between generations combine to make the Graviton2 a highly cost-effective workhorse processor.</p><p>Today, you can choose between General Purpose (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-m6g-ec2-instances-powered-by-arm-based-aws-graviton2/\">M6g</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-graviton2-instance-types-c6g-r6g-and-their-d-variant/\">M6gd</a>), Compute-Optimized (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-graviton2-powered-general-purpose-compute-optimized-memory-optimized-ec2-instances/\">C6g</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-ec2-c6gn-instances-100-gbps-networking-with-aws-graviton2-processors/\">C6gn</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-graviton2-instance-types-c6g-r6g-and-their-d-variant/\">C6gd</a>), Memory-Optimized (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-soon-graviton2-powered-general-purpose-compute-optimized-memory-optimized-ec2-instances/\">R6g</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-graviton2-instance-types-c6g-r6g-and-their-d-variant/\">R6gd</a>), and Burstable (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t4g-instances-burstable-performance-powered-by-aws-graviton2/\">T4g</a>) instances, all powered by fast, efficient Graviton2 processors. Our customers use these instances to run application servers, gaming servers, HPC workloads, video encoding, ad servers, and more. Multiple benchmarks (including <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amazon-graviton2-benchmarks&amp;num=1\">this one</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/powering-net-5-with-aws-graviton2-benchmark-results/\">this one</a>) have shown that these Graviton2-based instances deliver better price-performance than existing EC2 instances.</p><p><span><strong>New X2gd Instances</strong></span><br>I’m happy to announce the latest in our ever-growing roster of Graviton2-powered instances! The new X2gd instances have twice as much memory per vCPU as the memory-optimized R6g instances, and are designed for your memory-hunger workloads. This includes in-memory databases (Redis and Memcached), open source relational databases, Electronic Design Automation design &amp; verification, real-time analytics, caching services, and containers.</p><p>X2gd instances are available in eight sizes, and also in bare metal form. Here are the specs:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>vCPUs</td><td>Memory<br>(GiB)</td><td>Local NVMe Storage</td><td>Network Bandwidth<br>(Gbps)</td><td>EBS Throughput<br>(Gbps)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.medium</strong></td><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>1 x 59 GiB</td><td>Up to 10</td><td>Up to 4.750</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.large</strong></td><td>2</td><td>32</td><td>1 x 118 GiB</td><td>Up to 10</td><td>Up to 4.750</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.xlarge</strong></td><td>4</td><td>64</td><td>1 x 237 GiB</td><td>Up to 10</td><td>Up to 4.750</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.2xlarge</strong></td><td>8</td><td>128</td><td>1 x 475 GiB</td><td>Up to 10</td><td>Up to 4.750</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.4xlarge</strong></td><td>16</td><td>256</td><td>1 x 950 GiB</td><td>Up to 10</td><td>4.750</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.8xlarge</strong></td><td>32</td><td>512</td><td>1 x 1900 GiB</td><td>12</td><td>9.500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.12xlarge</strong></td><td>48</td><td>768</td><td>2 x 1425 GiB</td><td>20</td><td>14.250</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.16xlarge</strong></td><td>64</td><td>1024</td><td>2 x 1900 GiB</td><td>25</td><td>19.000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>x2gd.metal</strong></td><td>64</td><td>1024</td><td>2 x 1900 GiB</td><td>25</td><td>19.000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When compared to the existing X1 instances, the new X2gd instances offer 55% better price/perfomance. The X2gd instances also offer the lowest price per GiB of memory of any current EC2 instance.</p><p>On the compute side, the X2gd instances provide the same amount of CPU power as the other Graviton2-powered instances (M6g, C6g, R6g, and T4g). Each vCPU is an entire physical core, which speeds compute-heavy EDA and financial service workloads, and also encourages denser packing of containers onto an instance of a particular size.</p><p>In addition to the fast SSD-based local NVMe storage, X2gd instances support Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), and can deliver up to 25 Gbps of network bandwidth between instances when launched within a Placement Group.</p><p>X2gd instances are built on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\" title=\"\">AWS Nitro System</a>, and you can use your existing Arm-compatible EC2 AMIs.</p><p><span><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br>X2gd instances are available now in the <span title=\"\">US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span title=\"\">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title=\"\">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title=\"\">Europe (Ireland)</span> Regions, with more regions to come.
