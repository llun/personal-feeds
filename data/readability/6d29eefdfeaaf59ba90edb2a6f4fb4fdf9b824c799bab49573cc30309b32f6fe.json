Make your own judgements on lumping Pinot with Van der Poel, but&nbsp;Roglič needs to get on the phone to his agent.</p><p>Rounding out the list are the highest paid 'sprinter' Elia Viviani and Nairo Quintana on €1.9 million followed at 20 by Fernando Gaviria on €1.8 million.</p><p>While a few riders have had a big payday after smashing the 2020 season (or switching teams), one rider has fallen off the list considerably.</p><p>Last year Fabio Aru sat in fifth with €2.6 million, but after a few disappointing seasons with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE Team Emirates</a>, his move to Qhubeka-Assos hasn't been quite as lucrative.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Top 20 highest paid riders, according to <em>L'Équipe</em></b></p><p>1.
