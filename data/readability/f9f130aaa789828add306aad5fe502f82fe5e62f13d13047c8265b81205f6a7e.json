controllers has also been included in iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, so the latest gaming controller options from Sony and Microsoft are now compatible with Apple's product lineup.</p><p>We don't yet know if there's anything else included in tvOS 14.5 in terms of features because tvOS updates are often minor in scale, but the release of tvOS will see Apple begin enforcing its new App Tracking Transparency rules, with developers now required to ask for and receive a user's permission to access their random advertising identifier (known as the IDFA) to track user activity across apps and websites for ad customization purposes.</p><p>Going forward, when an app wants to access a person's advertising identifier on tvOS, users will have a prompt with options to \"Allow Tracking\" or \"Ask App Not to Track.\" Selecting \"Ask App Not to Track\" will prevent the app's developer from accessing the user's IDFA, and developers will also have to respect the user's tracking preference and refrain from using other invasive cross-app tracking methods.</p><p>The main <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a> update released in September brought expanded Picture in
