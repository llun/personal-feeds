Higher scores indicate \"healthier cardiac, respiratory, circulatory, and neuromuscular function,\" according to Apple.</p><p>Conducted by Stanford University researchers and funded by Apple, the study provided 110 Veterans Affairs patients with cardiovascular disease with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 7 and Apple Watch Series 3. Patients conducted regular at-home six-minute walking tests, which were then compared to their standard in-clinic 6MWT performance.</p><p>The study found that an Apple Watch was able to accurately assess frailty with a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 85 percent when supervised in a clinical setting. When assessed in an unsupervised setting at home, the Apple Watch was able to accurately assess frailty with a sensitivity of 83 percent and specificity of 60 percent.</p><p>The findings indicate that passive activity data gathered by the Apple Watch is an accurate predictor of in-clinic 6MWT performance.</p><blockquote><p>In this longitudinal observational study, passive activity data acquired by an ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch were an accurate predictor of in-clinic 6MWT performance. This finding suggests that frailty and functional capacity could be monitored and evaluated remotely in patients with cardiovascular disease, enabling safer and higher resolution monitoring of patients.</p></blockquote><p>While the study used a specially-developed app called \"VascTrac\" to gather 6MWT data alongside the Apple Watch's passively-collected activity data, Apple has since included a series of new mobility-related health metrics in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a>, including the 6MWT. It is likely that preliminary data from studies such as this encouraged Apple to add the metrics in ‌watchOS 7‌.</p><p>The research may urge healthcare providers to offer at-home assessment of functional capacity in cardiovascular disease patients using an Apple Watch.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/24/apple-fumble-iphone-12-ad/\">Apple Shares 'Fumble' Ad Highlighting iPhone 12 Ceramic Shield</a></h3><p>Wednesday March 24, 2021 6:33 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple today shared a new ad that focuses on the iPhone 12's durability, specifically highlighting the Ceramic Shield display, which is meant to be tougher than standard smartphone glass.
