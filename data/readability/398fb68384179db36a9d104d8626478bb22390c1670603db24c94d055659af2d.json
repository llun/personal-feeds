Having the right kit will go a long way to improving your winter riding.</span></figcaption><p><span><i>Robert Smith/Immediate Media</i></span></p></div><h2>Wearing too much kit</h2><p><span>Great, you’ve now got all the gear. But that doesn’t mean you have to wear it all at once. While you want to be warm on a ride, there can be too much of a good thing — starting off snug and cosy can soon turn into a wet, soggy mess once you’ve got a few miles under your belt or hit a climb, and with this comes the dreaded wind chill.</span></p><p><span>To counter this, it’s best to wear a </span><span>number of layers</span><span> that can be added or removed as conditions change during your ride. Matt Bottrill of </span><a href=\"https://www.mattbottrillperformancecoaching.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span>Matt Bottrill Performance Coaching</span></a><span> swears by a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-gilets/\">cycling gilet</a> as a lightweight, easily-stowable layer to keep the wind off your chest, without overheating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“At this time of year, the weather can change and you can get cold quickly, so always have layers of clothing,” he says. “If you can keep yourself warm and dry [through winter], you’re more likely to have consistent training.”</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-layering-up-for-winter-cycling/\"><span>How to layer up for winter cycling</span></a></li></ul><h2>Not planning ahead</h2><p><span>If you have a goal in mind for next season, winter is the perfect time to start preparing for the year ahead. While it might seem too early to be training for next season, the work you do now will stand you in good stead come summer.</span></p><p><span>As with any training, it’s </span><span>best to have a plan</span><span> to help you focus on what you want to achieve – rather than doing sporadic sessions where there’s no progression. Each session should be part of a bigger jigsaw that leads towards your overall goal, according to Bottrill.</span></p><p><span>“While you’re training, you should be thinking about the next training day,” he says. “I’ve always said that you want to plan two weeks in advance to sort out the structure of your programme.”</span></p><h2>Not sticking the bike on the turbo the night before</h2><p><span>If your winter training involves a morning turbo workout — the turbo is a great way to get the most out of your training time — this mistake can end up costing you a whole session, just by not doing something that takes a few minutes in advance.</span></p><p><span>“If my bike’s not on the turbo ready to go, that session just doesn’t happen,” says Dr David Nichols, cycle training consultant for Wattbike. “It’s about making it as convenient and easy to happen, and pretty much any excuse not to set the alarm and get on the bike is good enough not to do the session.”</span></p><p><span>Set yourself a reminder in the evening to get your bike on the turbo and you’ll have one less reason not to do that morning workout.</span></p><ul><li><a

It’s easy to think that ‘no lights’ equals ‘no training’ and therefore an extra hour in bed, particularly with the lack of daylight through winter.</span></p><p><span>If you do muster the motivation to get out, remembering to charge your lights will reduce the risk of them running out mid-ride.</span></p><p><span>A simple way to keep on top of this is to take the lights off your bike to be charged after every ride (or every couple of rides if your lights have a long battery life).</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\"><span>Best bike lights for road cycling</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-lights/\">Best mountain bike lights</a></li></ul><h2>Riding too far from home</h2><p><span>While it can often be tempting to discover new roads on long training rides, Bottrill recommends sticking to tried and tested routes not too far from home during the depths of winter, particularly if the weather is poor.</span></p><p><span>Being miles from the nearest bike shop or stood on the side of the road in the cold trying to fix your bike isn’t fun.</span></p><p><span>Bottrill says he always rides circuits at this time of year for that very reason, never straying too far in case of mid-ride mechanicals, or in case we needs to get home quickly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While it might not be the most interesting way to train, it limits the potential for things to go wrong. Plus, you’ll have new routes to look forward to discovering in the spring.</span></p><p><span>If you do head off the beaten track in winter, make sure you have everything you need to stay well-fed and watered, and the essentials you need to fix common mechanicals.</span></p><h2>Forgetting to hydrate</h2><p><span>When riding in the summer, you’d never think of leaving the house on a long ride without a couple of bidons full of water.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So why should things be any different come winter? Sure, it’s not as warm, but you need to keep your body hydrated — you’re still working hard, even if your perspiration isn’t as obvious.</span></p><p><span>“It’s one thing that gets neglected — when it’s not warm, we don’t hydrate,” says Bottrill.</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-stay-hydrated-on-your-bike/\"><span>How to stay hydrated on the
