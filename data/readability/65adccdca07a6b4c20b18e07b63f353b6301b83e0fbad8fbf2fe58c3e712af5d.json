New copies of the six books were no longer for sale online at major retailers such as Barnes &amp; Noble on Thursday afternoon, which put eBay among the most prominent platforms for the books to be sold.</p><p>Hundreds of listings for the six books could be found on the platform as of Thursday morning, though the number appeared to be lower than it was on Wednesday evening. The eBay spokeswoman said that it would take some time to review seller listings and that the company was monitoring newly published listings.</p><p>Retailers frequently make decisions to remove products from their platforms for a variety of reasons.

At the same time, others contend the platforms aren’t doing enough to police inappropriate content.</p><p>Dr. Seuss Enterprises LP, which oversees Dr. Seuss’s publishing interests and ancillary areas, Tuesday said it had decided that six of the famed author’s books—“And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street”; “If I Ran the Zoo”; “McElligot’s Pool”; “On Beyond Zebra!”; “Scrambled Eggs Super!” and “The Cat’s Quizzer”—would no longer be published because they “portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong.”</p></div></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"65adccdca07a6b4c20b18e07b63f353b6301b83e0fbad8fbf2fe58c3e712af5d","category":"Tech"}
