If Spotify chooses not to collect payments via the ‌‌App Store‌‌, Apple purportedly \"applies a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions\" on the company. It is also said that Apple was \"locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, and Apple Watch,\" thereby making ‌Apple Music‌ a more attractive option for subscribers.</p><p>In what appears to be a significant advancement in the antitrust case, Apple looks to be hit with charges by the European Commission, suggesting that the company has likely been found to have conducted itself anti-competitively and violated the EU's antitrust rules. The EU is now actively preparing a charge sheet against Apple, according to sources speaking to <em>Reuters</em>, which may be sent to the company before the summer.</p><p>The Spotify antitrust case is one of several opened by the European Commission into Apple's business practices last year in June last year, including similar cases from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/apple-new-eu-antitrust-complaint-kobo/\">Kobo-owner Rakuten</a>. It is not yet known what exactly the EU's charges could involve, but it has been suggested that Apple could be forced to pay a fine or make changes to its ‌App Store‌ business model in Europe to foster greater competition.</p><p><small>Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/political-news.218/\">Political News</a> forum.
