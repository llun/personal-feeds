Achievements are great motivators, and the achievement badges for the activity tracking on the Apple Watch have inspired many users to get more exercise.</p><p>If you want to maximize your badge count, you’re going to want to chase down as many activity achievements as you can.

Past and future monthly challenges, for example, won’t show up, nor do all the various individual exercise workouts.</p><p>Here is a list of all the standard badges you can get.</p><h4>First [exercise] Workout</h4><p>The first time you perform a new exercise for at least 5 minutes, you’ll get a achievement badge. Every workout type that does not fall under the “Other” category is eligible for this badge: from walking to yoga to HIIT to hiking and more.</p><p>Activities with both indoor and outdoor variants, like Cycling and Walking, are bundled together; you can do either activity to get the badge, and can only get it once.</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by Macworld's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><h4>[exercise] Workout Record</h4><p>Every time you beat your previous best record for calories burned in any of the exercises listed above, you get this badge.</p><p>There is one caveat: You must complete five workouts of that type first. If you want to game the system, make sure your first four workouts of each type are short and easy, so it won’t take much effort to beat them.</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_51f93ba34d83c256fa05ec4941cd32ef\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01ezd53yw8bgcr3b9zy7xsev1e\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-exercise-challenges-100752944-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>\n<p>You get a badge the first time you do each major exercise type, and when you break a record.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"activity exercise challenges\" width=\"700\" height=\"578\" data-imageid=\"100752944\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-exercise-challenges-100752944-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-exercise-challenges-100752944-large.jpg\"></a><small>IDG</small><figcaption><p>You get a badge the first time you do each major exercise type, and when you break a record.</p></figcaption></figure><h4>7-Workout Week</h4><p>Simply complete any workout of at least 15 minutes every day of the week. Note that the week is Monday-Sunday, and you have to do a workout on each of those days (you can’t simply do any seven days in a row). If you start a walking workout whenever you walk outside, you can achieve this easily.</p><h4>New Move Record</h4><p>Any day that your Move ring goes further than ever before (meaning you burned more calories in a day), you’ll earn this award. There’s one catch: you have to use your Apple Watch for 10 days before you can complete this.</p><h4>New Exercise Record</h4><p>This is just like the Move Record achievement, only for the green ring. This one is based on minutes of exercise, not calories burned, so it’s really easy to get. Just like the Move Record achievement, you have to use your Apple Watch for 10 days first.</p><h4>Move Goal 200%, 300%, 400%</h4><p>You earn this when you exceed your calorie target (the red Move ring) by 2x, 3x, or 4x, respectively. In other words, it’s given for making the red activity ring go around two, three, or four times in a day. It’s easy to get if you just set your Move goal very low.</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_57884ea7e39976699b23eabbe61bb182\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01ezd53yw8bgcr3b9zy7xsev1e\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-move-percent-challenges-100752943-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>\n<p>Double, triple, and quadruple your Move ring goal.

Reduce your goal if you’re having trouble.</p></figcaption></figure><h4>New Move Goal</h4><p>Every time you change your daily Move goal, and then exceed that new goal, you get this achievement. You can change your Move goal by opening the Activity app on your Apple Watch and force-pressing the screen.</p><h4>Longest Move Streak</h4><p>When you hit your Move goal (close the red ring) several days in a row, that’s a “streak.” You get this award when your streak finally ends, if it’s longer than your previous best streak.</p><h4>Perfect Week</h4><p>This is given out for four categories: Move, Exercise, Stand, and All Activity. For the first three, simply close the rings (red, green, or blue) every day of the week. To get the Perfect Week (All Activity) badge, close <em>all three rings</em> every day for an entire week. You can earn this multiple times, though it only shows one badge.</p><p>Remember, one week in the Activity app is from Monday-Sunday!</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-weekly-challenges-100752940-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>\n<p>Close those rings every day from Monday to Sunday to earn a handful of badges.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"activity weekly challenges\" width=\"700\" height=\"571\" data-imageid=\"100752940\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-weekly-challenges-100752940-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-weekly-challenges-100752940-large.jpg\"></a><small>IDG</small><figcaption><p>Close those rings every day from Monday to Sunday to earn a handful of badges.</p></figcaption></figure><h4>Perfect Month</h4><p>Unlike Perfect Week, there are not multiple different Perfect Month badges for the different color rings. The lone Perfect Month achievement is for closing the red Move ring every day of the month.</p><p>There’s a separate Perfect Month badge for every month and every year, though. So you can earn this in February and again in March, and again in February in the next year.</p><h4>Monthly Challenge</h4><p>Each month has its own unique fitness challenge. If you have notifications set for the Activity app on our Apple Watch, you’ll see the goal presented at the beginning of the month, but you’ll also see the current month’s challenge in the Achievements tab of the Activity app on your iPhone. It will be a grey outline before it’s completed, but you can tap on it to see what the challenge entails.</p><p>The monthly challenge may task you with burning a specific number of calories, working out a number of times, or traveling a certain distance. There’s no telling what each new month will bring, you just have to look!</p><figure><img alt=\"activity monthly challenges\" width=\"700\" height=\"551\" data-imageid=\"100752942\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-monthly-challenges-100752942-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-monthly-challenges-100752942-large.jpg\"> <small>IDG</small><figcaption><p>There’s a different challenge every month, so check your Activity app.</p></figcaption></figure><h4>100, 365, 500, 1,000 Move Goals</h4><p>When you hit your daily Move goal (close the red ring) 100 times, you get an achievement badge. You get another for hitting it 365 times, 500 times, and 1,000 times. These do not need to be in a row; it’s just the total number of times you’ve ever hit the goal.</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/03/activity-move-challenges-100752941-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>\n<p>Close the Move ring often to unlock a series of badges.
