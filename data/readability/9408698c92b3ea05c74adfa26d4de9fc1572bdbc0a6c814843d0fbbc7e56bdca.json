However, with men’s racing already <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">going ahead</a> successfully, it seems that we can look to the women’s early Spring calendar with some tentative optimism.</p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/seven-women-s-cycling-races-to-watch-in-2021\">Related – Seven women's races to watch in 2021</a>&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season</a></strong></em></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Grace_Brown_CorVos_SWpix.com_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612439812\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em>Grace Brown.

This year will be no different as riders rush to get their season started and test their legs before Strade Bianche.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/LB_RB_CorVos_SWpix.com_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612439269\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em>Strade Bianche.

Annemiek van Vleuten on her new team, Movistar, will be targeting a third consecutive win in Siena but anything could happen on the white roads.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Alex_Whitehead_SWpix.com_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612439024\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em>Lisa Klein (Photo Credit: Alex Whitehead/<span>SWpix.com</span>)</em></p><h4><strong>Healthy Ageing Tour - 2.1 (09/03/21 - 12/03/21)</strong></h4><p>The last early-season stage race standing so far, The Healthy Ageing Tour should be celebrating its 10th edition in 2021 but, like many races, was cancelled last year.</p><p>Those who were hoping to test out their climbing legs over multiple stages will still be disappointed, however, as the race — which takes place in Northern Holland — is completely flat throughout. Lisa Klein of Canyon//SRAM took the win in 2019 by 8 seconds ahead of Ellen van Dijk of Trek-Segafredo.</p><div><form novalidate=\"\" isembed=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div><div component=\"[object Object]\" alignment=\"center\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><img imageratio=\"0.008333333333333333\" src=\"https://d3k81ch9hvuctc.cloudfront.net/company/JQVLkV/images/92cf782c-a79d-4080-a0a0-9b006716be2d.png\" tabindex=\"-1\"></p></div><div data-gramm=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" component=\"[object Object]\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><span>Subscribe to our women's newsletter,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>produced in association with Rapha, to receive</span></p><p><span>a weekly complement of racing, gear and cycling</span></p><p><span>culture focussed on women</span></p></div><div component=\"[object Object]\" alignment=\"center\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><img imageratio=\"0.008333333333333333\" src=\"https://d3k81ch9hvuctc.cloudfront.net/company/JQVLkV/images/92cf782c-a79d-4080-a0a0-9b006716be2d.png\" tabindex=\"-1\"></p></div></div></form></div><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Lizzie_Deignan_Plouay_Alex_Whitehead_SWPix.com_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612441556\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em>Lizzie Deignan. (Photo credit <span>SWPix.com</span>)&nbsp;</em></p><h4><strong>Trofeo Alfredo Binda - Comune di Cittiglio - 1.WWT (21/03/21)</strong></h4><p>The standalone women’s race has been held as a World Cup and latterly WorldTour race since 2008.</p><p>Heralded as the WWT’s answer to Il Lombardia, the rolling 124km course comprises eight laps of a 15.5km&nbsp;circuit. The race&nbsp;favours punchier riders as the fact that the most recent winner was Marianne Vos (back in 2019) illustrates. Amanda Spratt and Cecile Uttrup Ludwig&nbsp;also made the podium last year and would not be out of place in 2021 either.</p><h4><strong>AG Driedaagse Brugge-De Panne - 1.WWT (25/03/21)</strong></h4><p>One of the final WWT races of 2020 — held on 20th October — will now be one of the first to take place in 2021. Young sprinting juggernaut and former winner of the WWT young rider classification, Lorena Wiebes, took the win last year&nbsp;ahead of Lisa Brennauer&nbsp;with Lotte Kopecky in third.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/desire-journal/pro-team-bikes-2021\"><em><strong>Related –&nbsp;WorldTour team bikes 2021</strong></em></a>&nbsp;</p><p>De Panne is as flat as it sounds and, with nowhere to break away, usually culminates in a bunch kick between the pure sprinters. Look out for Chloe Hosking on her new team of Trek-Segafredo as well as last year’s podium finishers.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/1607014060260_1024x1024.jpg?v=1610723064\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em>Lorena Wiebes</em></p><h4><strong>Gent-Wevelgem - 1.WWT (28/03/21)</strong></h4><p>Sprinters who can get over the short, sharp climbs usually rule this 136km race. Last year’s edition, held in October, was no exception as Belgian Jolien d’Hoore took the bunch kick from compatriot, Lotte Kopecky.</p><p>D’Hoore will no doubt want to replicate that win in her final season as a pro, but there will be plenty of competition chasing her up the Kemmelberg.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Chantal_van_den_Broek_Blaak_Flanders_Anton_Vos_Cor_Vos_SWPix_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612441897\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em>Chantal van den Broek-Blaak (Photo credit: Anton Vos/Cor Vos/<span>SWPix.com</span>)</em></p><h4><strong>Tour of Flanders / Ronde van Vlaanderen - 1.WWT (04/03/21)</strong></h4><p>The 2021 Tour of Flanders comes a mere five months after Chantal van den Broek-Blaak won the&nbsp;previous edition.</p><p>While the men’s event has celebrated over 100 editions to-date, the women only began to race the Tour of Flanders in 2004. Brutal ascents of cobbled climbs such as the Muur and the Paterberg coupled with the aggressive racing of women’s peloton make Flanders as unpredictable as it is exciting.</p><h4><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_572319_pave_004_c6f80c39-ce85-4b12-819b-7d7a0ce0add0_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612461484\" alt=\"\"></strong></h4><h4><strong>Paris-Roubaix&nbsp;-&nbsp; 1.WWT (11/03/21)</strong></h4><p>Fans and riders alike will be crossing their fingers that the inaugural Women’s Paris-Roubaix can go ahead on Sunday 11th April. After the race was teasingly added to the calendar last year and then just as swiftly yanked away among Covid cancellations the anticipation is mounting.</p><p>As this will be the first women’s Roubaix, the only metric for predicting who might perform is by studying past cobbled Classics results. However, as this is Paris-Roubaix, unpredictability and chaos rule and any speculation will likely be thrown out of the window. Still, look out for the usual suspects like Marianne Vos and Anna van der Breggen at the front of the race.&nbsp;</p></div></div>","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"9408698c92b3ea05c74adfa26d4de9fc1572bdbc0a6c814843d0fbbc7e56bdca","category":"Cycling"}
