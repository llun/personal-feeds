That’s a good sign, right? People are very interested in this bike and it’s easy to see why. Dillen from Baphomet originally called this bike his “Right-Hand Path”, with his personal hardtail being the “Left-Hand Path,” yet his Instagram followers summed it up perfectly with the catchy name “Shreddy Rando.”</p><p>So let’s look at this bike in detail, including a synopsis from Dillen.<span id=\"more-207214\"></span></p><p>When I do Beautiful Bicycle galleries from framebuilders, I usually email them, clarifying my notes, and asking questions I might have forgotten during the Shop Visit. Dillen’s response made me change this up a bit, so let’s just read what he has to say:</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>I specifically designed it thinking about the old forest service broncos. Something that could take you down any fire road endlessly while hauling all the necessary gear. In the design process, I made a point to give it a high-volume front triangle for a big frame bag.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>I’ve been itching to get it outfitted with bags but can’t afford the good shit at the moment, so it will have to wait. Imagine it with a Swift rando bag up front, Zeitgeist out back, and a custom half frame bag in the middle! (All in coyote colour of course.) I think this is the closest thing to a “road bike” I’ll ever make.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-65.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-67.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><em>Circling back to Dillen’s no-plastic principles, his cable hoops eliminate zip ties.

In general all my bikes are Zona unless there are shortages).</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-76.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Sliding dropouts because when you are 200 miles from home and you tear a derailleur off, you want to not die out in the woods. Seriously though, I made this thing with very long miles in mind. I opted for the Eagle shifter because I think bar-end shifting is annoying and I can’t afford the wireless goodies.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-55.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>In the future, I might spring for AXS though, because I would love to be able to charge a spare derailleur battery tucked away in the rando bag with the generator hub though.</p><p>Numbers the geometry heads want to hear are as follows:<br>-HT 70º<br>-ST 72º<br>-BB drop 75mm<br>-Chainstay 450mm</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-72.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-71.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-62.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Components:<br>-Rodeo Labs Spork<br>-White Industries cranks<br>-White Industries wheels<br>-René Herse Antelope Hill tires<br>-Paul seatpost and clamp<br>-Paul Klampers<br>-Paul stem<br>-TRP levers<br>-Ergon saddle<br>-Dajia Cycle Works drops<br>-SON hub and Sinewave Beacon lamp with rear light<br>-Velo Orange fenders<br>-Velo Orange Flat Pack Rack</p></div><nav><h4>Related</h4></nav></article></section></div>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"fe39094a0a988cbf79bba328f8c4fa880f0a8a8c72ec2e7ea7050c6853a8e53b","category":"Cycling"}
