{"title":"Preview: What you need to know about stage 1 of the 2021 Tour de France","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-1-of-the-2021-tour-de-france/","date":1624658578000,"content":"<div><div><p><strong>Date: </strong>Saturday June 26<br><strong>Start:</strong> Brest<br><strong>Finish: </strong>Landerneau<br><strong>Distance:</strong> 197.8 km</p><p>There’s no boring sprint stage to start this year’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>. Instead we get a pretty lumpy day that features four, fourth-category climbs, and two third-category climbs. The last of those is actually an uphill finish to the line: 3.1 km at 5.6% with a max gradient of 14%. Riders are reporting that the climb is actually <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/qa-jack-haig-on-tour-de-france-leadership-racing-for-bahrain-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">harder than they first thought</a>, so this could be an interesting start to the Tour.</p><p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> There are lots of changes of direction on this stage and it can get windy in Brittany. Also: there’s real potential here for a GC contender to lose a few seconds on the final climb.<br><strong>Who’s it for:</strong> Strong puncheurs who dream of wearing yellow.<br><strong>Dane Cash’s picks<em>:</em></strong><em> This should be a stage for some of the most popular riders in the race, and I like Mathieu van der Poel most of all. Julian Alaphilippe should be in contention as well, while Jumbo-Visma will have to decide whether to give Wout van Aert a shot at stage 1 glory or to put him to work for Primoz Roglic.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_ET01_carte.jpeg\"></figure></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"45ac0eba1aac4fda01d279ff8246e5a5010faedafce5fee26413c391f60254b4","category":"Cycling"}
