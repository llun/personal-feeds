We still recommend plenty of storage, but the choice of which iPhone to get it on isn’t quite so simple. Apple currently sells <em>five</em> “new” iPhone models and you can still buy an iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, not to mention older refurbished models. Apple offers all this choice because, quite simply, different people have different priorities.</p><p>Apple’s latest iPhone lineup includes the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234703/iphone-12-review.html\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234762/iphone-12-pro-review-the-iphone-thats-future-proof.html\">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234828/iphone-12-pro-max-review.html\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234921/iphone-12-mini-review-a-concentration-not-a-reduction.html\">iPhone 12 mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3540298/iphone-se-2020-review-everything-you-need-and-nothing-else.html\">iPhone SE</a>. The “best” iPhone depends on your own personal preferences, so we have several recommendations for different groups of users. We’ll summarize our choices here, and provide links to articles explaining each choice in more detail.</p><h2 id=\"toc-1\">iPhone specs compared</h2><p>Apple sells five current-generation model iPhones: four iPhone 12s and the iPhone SE.

This is the sweet spot in terms of design, size, features, performance, and cost (starting at $799). The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234762/iphone-12-pro-review-the-iphone-thats-future-proof.html\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> offers an additional telephoto camera, LiDAR, and stainless steel sides instead of aluminum, but for most people it’s going to be really hard to justify spending $200 more for that stuff. You still get all the important stuff: the super-fast A14 processor, the excellent photo and video quality, HDR OLED display, Face ID, 5G, ceramic shield front display, and MagSafe. If you take a lot of photos and videos, you might want to spring for the 128GB model (the base model has 64GB of storage).</p><h2 id=\"best-iphone-for-photography-iphone-12-pro-max\">Best iPhone for photography: iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2><p>Typically, the “Max” version of an iPhone is the same as the regular-sized Pro version, only with a bigger display and a bigger battery. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234828/iphone-12-pro-max-review.html\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> actually&nbsp;has a different camera setup than the iPhone 12 Pro—and it’s worth the extra money if you want the very best photos. The only real drawback is that it’s quite big at 6.7 inches, so you’ll want to consider the size before buying. It’s also quite expensive at $1,099 and up. But if you can handle the size and price, you’ll be getting a ridiculously good camera.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334289/the-best-iphone-for-photography.html\">Read more about our choice</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;Larger sensor, enhanced stabilization, better telephoto lens<br><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Very big, expensive</p><h2 id=\"best-iphone-for-gaming-iphone-12-pro-max\">Best iPhone for gaming: iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2><p>It seems like a cop-out to simply pick the newest and most expensive iPhone as “best” for gaming, but there are real benefits here. Yes of course it has the fastest new A14 processor, as all iPhone 12 models do. But virtual gaming controls often work much better on a large display, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234828/iphone-12-pro-max-review.html\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> is the biggest. Gaming is perhaps the most battery-draining thing you can do on your iPhone, and the Max also has the biggest battery with the longest life of any iPhone ever.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334312/the-best-iphone-for-gaming.html\">Read more about our choice</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;Top performance, huge display, longest battery life ever<br><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Really big, really expensive</p><article aria-label=\"Article: 2021 Mazda CX-30 2.5 Turbo Drive Review\" role=\"article\" tabindex=\"0\" id=\"ntv1124785-430741-7063\"><div><p><a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N843334.1748112NATIVOINC/B24083865.297798410;dc_trk_aid=491080732;dc_trk_cid=131742883;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;gdpr=0;gdpr_consent=;ltd=\" onmousedown=\"PostRelease.GetHrefUrl('https://jadserve.postrelease.com/trk?ntv_at=3&amp;ntv_ui=9dd62a8c-bf9d-4673-a6be-ca7fba824b7a&amp;ntv_a=lZIGAsyVLAsSkRA&amp;ntv_fl=7uDOAz88QViW5FhnhWWSVSZywurDveitzYf4Rsfgl3B139w8esKeV1OTk4h4L1wS93WRHgo--_yTIZGh4aH_heSjACUyVHTHo2DXNLs4fhQAaoGztF_vQJDih1-O8cNxZz43XiXGrK0HeujrR4WVjizn4mr32J71UyLP7miOHqg=&amp;ord=90480975&amp;ntv_ht=qQ9eYAA&amp;ntv_tad=16&amp;ntv_r=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N843334.1748112NATIVOINC/B24083865.297798410;dc_trk_aid=491080732;dc_trk_cid=131742883;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;gdpr=0;gdpr_consent=;ltd=', false, this, '1124785-430741');\" onclick=\"PostRelease.GetHrefUrl('https://jadserve.postrelease.com/trk?ntv_at=3&amp;ntv_ui=9dd62a8c-bf9d-4673-a6be-ca7fba824b7a&amp;ntv_a=lZIGAsyVLAsSkRA&amp;ntv_fl=7uDOAz88QViW5FhnhWWSVSZywurDveitzYf4Rsfgl3B139w8esKeV1OTk4h4L1wS93WRHgo--_yTIZGh4aH_heSjACUyVHTHo2DXNLs4fhQAaoGztF_vQJDih1-O8cNxZz43XiXGrK0HeujrR4WVjizn4mr32J71UyLP7miOHqg=&amp;ord=90480975&amp;ntv_ht=qQ9eYAA&amp;ntv_tad=16&amp;ntv_r=https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N843334.1748112NATIVOINC/B24083865.297798410;dc_trk_aid=491080732;dc_trk_cid=131742883;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;gdpr=0;gdpr_consent=;ltd=', false, this, '1124785-430741');\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"3rd party ad, opens in a new window\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ntvcld-a.akamaihd.net/image/upload/w_640,h_360,c_fill,g_auto:text,f_auto/assets/B1FFB0BDFCAC49F18B8C615B9A2E3386.jpg\"></a></p></div></article><p>Most kids don’t need a large or an expensive phone. Let’s face it, kids are rough on electronics. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3540298/iphone-se-2020-review-everything-you-need-and-nothing-else.html\">iPhone SE</a> is plenty fast to run anything and will last several years. It’s also got Touch ID rather than Face ID, which sometimes struggles with very young faces (Apple says Face ID is only appropriate for people over 13). The smaller size fits better in young hands and pockets, and the $399 price tag will please parents.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334296/the-best-iphone-for-kids.html\">Read more about our choice</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;Price, size, durability, performance<br><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;No Face ID, older design</p><h2 id=\"best-iphone-for-seniors-iphone-se\">Best iPhone for seniors: iPhone SE</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3540298/iphone-se-2020-review-everything-you-need-and-nothing-else.html\">iPhone SE</a>&nbsp;is a godsend for seniors or anyone else on a fixed income. Starting at only $399, it gives you a fully modern iPhone with an A13 processor, so it’ll likely get iOS updates for another four or five years. Even with just a single lens, the camera is quite good, and some seniors will find Touch ID easier to deal with than Face ID (especially if their previous smartphone was an older iPhone).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334307/the-best-iphone-for-seniors.html\">Read more about our choice</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;Price, display size, Face ID<br><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Older processor, single camera</p><h2 id=\"the-best-small-iphone-iphone-12-mini\">The best small iPhone: iPhone 12 mini</h2><p>Small phone fans are not that great in number—sales data consistently shows that most people prefer larger phones—but they are <em>very</em> sure of their preference for a small phone. This year, Apple made a small version of its high-end model, the iPhone 12 mini. It’s a no-compromise small phone for those who don’t want to buy an “old” design or technology just to get a phone that’s easier to hold and manipulate. Battery life suffers a bit, because you just can’t fit a big battery in a small phone, but you otherwise all the iPhone 12 goodness in a tiny package including 5G and MagSafe.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/340212/iphone-12-mini-iphone-se-design-size-display-camera-features-face-id-touch-id-specs-performance-battery-price.html\">Read more about our choice</a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Less expensive, small, full performance and features<br><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;Battery life</p></div><p><em>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
