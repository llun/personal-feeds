For as long as radios have crackled in the pro peloton riders have carried them on their backs. Personally, I hated seeing a rider wearing a super-fast skinsuit only to have a block-shaped box sticking up on their back, no doubt negating some of the suit’s performance gains. It seems Chris Froome and others have now taken to placing the radio in the much-less-exposed chest area.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tour-de-France-time-trial-119-1340x754.jpg\"></figure><h2>Gearing</h2><p>Big plates all round.
