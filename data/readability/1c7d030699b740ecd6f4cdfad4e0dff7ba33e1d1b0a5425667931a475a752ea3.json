Many of the most challenging cobbled climbs Flanders has to offer pose the main obstacle.</p><p>One of the main chances for riders to attack lies on the Taaienberg (0.6km @ 6.8%), which arrives with over 80km still remaining. Later, the Paterberg (0.4km @ 10.6%) and Oude-Kwaremont (1.5km @ 4.7%) arrive with 58 and 53 kilometres remaining respectively. At this point we could already see a major selection made. However, the distance to the line does provide the opportunity for a group working well together to close the gap to any escapees. The final 12.5km are entirely flat to the finish in Harelbeke</p><p><strong>Favourites</strong>: Wout Van Aert, Mathieu van der Poel, Deceuninck-Quick-Step</p><p><strong>Outsiders:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Michael Matthews, Kevin Geniets, Sonny Colbrelli</p><h4><strong>Gent-Wevelgem&nbsp;</strong><b>- 1.WT (28/03)</b></h4><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/dwars-door-vlaanderen-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong></strong></em></a>Gent-Wevelgem is set to take place on 28th March. It is one of the Belgian classics that make up the Flemish Cycling Week, where cobbles, steep climbs, wind and rain are commonplace.</p><p>The race is frequently described as a sprinters classic due to its flat terrain in the final kilometres. Despite this, it’s not abnormal for attackers in a small group, or even a single escapee to claim victory.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gent-wevelgem-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong>Read our full&nbsp;Gent-Wevelgem</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>preview</strong></em></a></p><p><span>After being robbed of its typical position on the calendar due to the global pandemic in 2020, the 2021 edition of Gent-Wevelgem returns to it’s familiar place in spring. Nonetheless, strong crosswinds and unpleasant weather conditions are likely to add to the suffering — this race is not for the faint-hearted.</span></p><p>No rider has won the race more than three times. Peter Sagan is the only rider in the current peloton to have achieved that feat,&nbsp;as well as being&nbsp;the only rider to have achieved six podium finishes. Sagan’s victories&nbsp;display the unpredictable nature of the race perfectly — he won solo in 2013, from a select group of four riders including Fabian Cancellara in 2016, and in a mass-sprint in 2018.</p><p>The official route for Gent-Wevelgem 2021 will be revealed the day prior to the race. However, we can expect a similar route to previous seasons which saw riders take on over 230km and the Kemmelberg twice.</p><p><b>Favourites:<span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>Wout Van Aert, Davide Ballerini, Mads Pedersen</span></p><p><b>Outsiders:</b><span>&nbsp;Christophe Laporte, Jasper Philipsen, Timothy Dupont</span></p><h4><strong>Dwars Door Vlaanderen </strong><b>- 1.WT (31/03)</b></h4><p><b><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/dwars-door-vlaanderen-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong>Read our full&nbsp;Dwars Door Vlaanderen</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>preview</strong></em></a></b></p><p>Dwars Door Vlaanderen is traditionally the tune-up for the Tour of Flanders and is part of<span>&nbsp;the Flemish Cycling Week</span>. The race takes place mid-week, days ahead of the Tour of Flanders.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/dwars-door-vlaanderen-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong></strong></em></a>The first edition of&nbsp;<span>Dwars Door Vlaanderen</span><span>&nbsp;</span>took place in 1945, yet over the previous 65 years no rider has ammassed more than two victories. 13 riders have won twice, though,&nbsp;including Yves Lampaert and Niki Terpstra.</p><p>The 2020 edition of Dwars Door Vlaanderen was cancelled due to the global pandemic, meaning we must look back to 2019 to analyse how the latest edition played out. It was Mathieu van der Poel who won from a group of five riders after a now trademark early attack. Anthony Turgis was second whilst Bob Jungels was also on the podium.</p><p>There were 60 riders that finished within one minute of the winner, which is uncommon in any of the Flanders Classics. It’s more likely that we’ll see long-range attacks and small groups form. Yves Lampaert won solo in both 2017 and 2018, however, Greg Van Avermaet’s attack was controlled by the group behind in 2016 and the race was decided in a sprint with Jens Debuscherre taking victory.</p><p>The major difference between Dwars Door Vlaanderen and the Tour of Flanders is it’s length. At 185km, Dwars is typically around 80km shorter than the Tour of Flanders.</p><p>Like many Belgian classics this year, the official route is being kept private until the days leading up to the race. Nonetheless, we can anticipate a route similar in nature to recent times, beginning in Roeselare and ending in Waregem.</p><h4><strong></strong></h4><p><strong>Favourites:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Mathieu van der Poel, Deceuninck-Quick-Step</p><p><strong>Outsiders:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Anthony Turgis, Tom Pidcock, Christophe Laporte, Casper Pedersen</p><h4><strong>Tour of Flanders&nbsp;</strong><b>- 1.WT (04/04)</b></h4><p><span>The Tour of Flanders, or Ronde van Vlaanderen is one of the most epic races of the year. Some of Flanders’ most challenging cobbled climbs await the riders on&nbsp;<strong>Sunday 4th April.</strong>&nbsp;The race returns to it’s more familiar slot on the calendar, one week before Paris-Roubaix.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-of-flanders-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Read our full&nbsp;Tour of Flanders preview</em></strong></a></p><p><span>Like all of cycling’s monuments, the Tour of Flanders is etched deep with history — the first edition occurred in 1913. No rider has won the race more than three times, with six achieving that feat.</span></p><p><span>The Men’s 2020 edition was set to be one of the most anticipated three-way battles in recent times, with Mathieu van der Poel, Wout Van Aert and Julian Alaphilippe juking it out. However, three were reduced to two when Alaphilippe collided with a moto.&nbsp;</span><span>The two would crest the Paterberg, the final cobbled effort of the day with a healthy lead which prove&nbsp;unassailable for the rest.&nbsp;</span><span>In the end, Mathieu van der Poel narrowly sprinted to victory ahead of Van Aert to claim his first monument on the road. The first of many, we suspect.</span></p><p><span>The first kilometres of the race are used to establish a breakaway. However, soon enough the riders will reach a plethora of cobbled climbs. We are without the official route for the 2021 edition due to the global pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, we can expect a similar course to 2020. Here, we witnessed numerous ascents of the Oude Kwaremont. The first ascent, which occurs with 120km remaining, has the potential to be the first serious selection process of the day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Paterberg and Taaienberg are two more climbs synonymous with the Flanders Classics which will be ridden here.</span></p><p><span>Following the final climb of the day which is the Paterberg, there are 13km of flat to the finish in Oudenaarde, where we could see attacks go off the front or reeled in for a sprint.</span></p><p><b>Favourites:</b><span>&nbsp;Wout Van Aert, Julian Alaphilippe, Mathieu van der Poel</span></p><p><b>Outsiders:<span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>Jakob Fuglsang, Arjen Livyns, Michael Matthews, Valentin Madouas</span></p><h4><strong>Itzulia Basque Country&nbsp;</strong><b>- 2.WT (05/04-10/04)</b></h4><p>The Itzulia Basque Country Tour is a six day stage race in Northern Spain, where the riders will be exposed to some of the most challenging climbs the Basque region can offer.</p><h4><strong>Paris-Roubaix&nbsp;</strong><b>- 1.WT (11/04)</b></h4><p><em>\"The Hell of the North\".</em></p><p><span>Very few bike races are nicknamed with such marked connotations. But Paris-Roubaix really is a Sunday in Hell, for those riding at least.&nbsp;</span>For those lucky enough to be watching from the sofa, a ‘Sunday in Paradise’ would perhaps be more accurate.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Read our full&nbsp;Paris-Roubaix<span>&nbsp;</span>preview</em></strong></a></p><p><span>Throughout the day, the riders must tackle some of the most difficult cobblestones around. The Trouee d’Arenberg sector has become infamous in cycling folklore and is the most difficult sector of the race. In 2019, there was over 50km of cobblestones — no surprise then that only 100 riders finished.</span></p><p><span>Paris-Roubaix is one of cycling’s five monuments and is one of the oldest races around — the first edition took place in 1896.&nbsp;</span>Roger De Vlaeminck and Tom Boonen hold the record for the most wins with four apiece.</p><p>In 2020, for the first time since World War II, no edition of Paris-Roubaix took place due to the global pandemic. This fact alone makes us even more excited about The Hell of the North this year.</p><p><span>We are also thrilled to see&nbsp;the inaugural Women’s Paris-Roubaix this year.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><i><span></span></i><strong>Amstel Gold Race&nbsp;</strong><b>- 1.WT (18/04)</b></h4><p><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/amstel-gold-race-2021-preview\"><b>Read our full Amstel Gold preview</b></a></em></p><p><span>The Amstel Gold Race is one of the most prestigious non-monuments in cycling, particularly for Dutch riders. Won in stunning style by Mathieu van der Poel in 2019, the race returns after being cancelled in 2020.</span></p><h4><strong>La Flèche Wallonne&nbsp;- 1.WT (21/04)</strong></h4><p><span>A battle of the pure punchers. Those that are strong on hilly terrain will thrive on the Mur de Huy, the climb to the finish is less than 1 kilometre but averages over 12% gradient. Marc Hirschi won in 2020, breaking a six-year spell where the race was dominated by Alejandro Valverde and Julian Alaphilippe.</span></p><h4><strong>Liège-Bastogne-Liège&nbsp;- 1.WT (25/04)</strong></h4><p><span>The monument for the punchers. \"La Doyenne\", or \"The Old Lady \"is one of the longest races of the season, usually over 250km in length. It's also one of the eldest — it was first raced in 1892. Eddy Merckx is the only rider to have won the race on five occasions, but Primoz Roglic become the first Slovenian to win the race in 2020 after a controversional finish.</span></p><h4><strong>Tour de Romandie&nbsp;- 2.WT (27/04-02/05)</strong></h4><p>The final WorldTour stage race before the Giro d'Italia. The race often features numerous time trials and numerous difficulties in the Swiss Alps, perfect preparation for those looking to challenge for the maglia rosa at the Giro d'Italia a few weeks later.</p><h4><strong>Giro d'Italia&nbsp;</strong><b>- 2.WT (08/05 - 30/05)</b></h4><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/giro-ditalia-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Read our full&nbsp;Giro d'Italia preview</em></strong></a></p><p><span>The Giro d'italia is the first of the three Grand Tours in the 2021 cycling season.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Known for its steep, demanding climbs, the 2021 route looks set to provide an enthralling spectacle.</p><p>The 2021&nbsp;Giro was peculiar for a number of reasons. Usually taking place in May, the race was postponed until October. This made it challenging for riders attempting to complete the Tour-Giro double as they'd be forced to ride them in quick succession. The Vuelta a España also overlapped with the Giro, making it impossible to ride 100% of both races.</p><p>As the world attempts to return to normality, the cycling calendar does the same. This means that the Giro has been restored to it’s normal slot in May, two months prior to the Tour.</p><h4><strong>Critérium du Dauphiné&nbsp;- 2.WT (30/05-06/06)</strong></h4><p>One of the&nbsp;most prestigous stage-races in the world. Naturally, the winner is placed among the favourites for the Tour de France, and for good reason. Since 2010, the winner of the Dauphine does indeed go on to win the Tour a month later with a 50% success rate. The latest to do so was Geraint Thomas in 2018. The eight stages are filled with mountains, time-trials and some flat stages to entice the sprinters too.</p><h4><strong>Tour de Suisse&nbsp;- 2.WT (06/06-13/06)</strong></h4><p>The final chance for Tour de France contenders to prep for the race in a WorldTour stage race. Overlapping with the Dauphine, riders must choose one. One of the races to succumb to COVID-19 in 2020, Egan Bernal is the most recent winner in 2019.</p><h4><strong>Tour de France&nbsp;- 2.WT (06/26-07/18)</strong></h4><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\"><em><strong>Read our full Tour de France preview</strong></em></a></p><p>The big one. The race everyone talks about. The chase for the mailliot jaune, the most distinguished jersey in cycling. The Tour finished in the Autumn months in 2019, but returns to its familiar slot at the peak of the French Summer for 2021. The two heavy favourites are Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar, but all of the world's best cyclists want to ride the Tour de France.</p><h4><strong>Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa&nbsp;- 1.WT (31/07)</strong></h4><p>Taking place in the Basque region, this one day race is full of hills. Not too dissimilar in terrain to the Ardennes. A flat finish means that anyone with a strong kick has an opportunity if in a group. However, the previous edition was won solo by Remco Evenepoel, the crowning result of his neo-pro season.</p><h4><strong>Tour de Pologne&nbsp;- 2.WT (09/08-15/08)</strong></h4><p>On the topic of Remco, he's won this one as well. The 2020 Tour of Poland was marred by a crash on stage-one, where Fabio Jakobsen suffered serious injuries. The course is set to be modified going forward.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>La Vuelta a&nbsp;España&nbsp;- 2.WT (14/08-05/09)</strong></h4><p>The final Grand Tour of the year. This time, we are in Spain for La Vuelta. It is the youngest of the three Grand Tours, the first edition took place in 1935. Primoz Roglic is the double defending Champion having won the red jersey in 2019 and 2020. We wait to see whether he will return this year. As the Vuelta takes place near the end of the season, teams wait to assess form and fitness before deciding their lineup.</p><h4><strong>EuroEyes Cyclassics Hamburg&nbsp;- 1.WT (22/08)</strong></h4><p>This race has been Elia Viviani's stomping ground — the Italian has won the previous three editions. A true sprinter's classic where the world's best sprinters not at La Vuelta will have their fun.</p><h4><strong>Bretagne Classic&nbsp;- 1.WT (29/08)</strong></h4><p>A hilly classic in France, the victor has to be adept at climbing but quick in a finish. Oli Naesen and Sep Vanmarcke won in 2018 and 2019 respectively, but Michael Matthews won in 2020. The type of rider that wins can vastly vary depending on the way the race is ridden.</p><h4><strong>BinckBank Tour&nbsp;- 2.WT (30/08-05/09)</strong></h4><p>A stage-race for the cobblestone lovers. The BinckBank Tour is unique in featuring the 'Golden Kilometre', a chance for attacks and sprinters to gain considerable time in the GC.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Grand Prix Cyclise de&nbsp;Québec/Montréal&nbsp;- 1.WT (10/09 &amp; 12/09)</strong></h4><p>Two Canadian classics. Michael Matthews has reigned supreme here in recent times, winning three of the previous four races. It's not surprise either, Matthews was built to win here — strong on hills and difficult to beat in a sprint.</p><h4><strong>Eschborn-Frankfurt&nbsp;- 1.WT (19/09)</strong></h4><p>Alexander Kristoff's race. The Norwegian won this race in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018, though Pascal Ackermann defeated him in 2019. The race features some climbing earlier in the day but a flat run-in provides a great chance for the sprinters still present at the&nbsp;sharp end of the race.</p><h4><strong>Il Lombardia&nbsp;- 1.WT (09/10)</strong></h4><p>The final monument of the season. This is the monument that the climbers will look to with glee. The and Muro di Sormano and the Civiglio are some of the major climbs that have provided the main make-up for Il Lombardia as of late. Over 230km in length, Il Lombardia is a battle of attrition meaning it's rare to see large groups cross the line together. This was the case when Jakob Fuglsang won solo in 2020, to win the second monument of his career.</p><h4><strong>Gree-Tour of Guangxi&nbsp;- 2.WT (14/10-19/10)</strong></h4><p><span>The final WorldTour race of the season, and one of the newest races on the calendar. The first Gree-Tour of Guangxi took place in 2017. Since, winners include Tim Wellens, Gianni Moscon and Enric Mas.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em><span>Cover photo: Alex Broadway/ASO/<span>SWPix.com</span></span></em></p></div></div>","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"1c7d030699b740ecd6f4cdfad4e0dff7ba33e1d1b0a5425667931a475a752ea3","category":"Cycling"}
