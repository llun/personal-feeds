In a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">note seen by <em>MacRumors</em></a> yesterday, Kuo explained that Apple is reluctant to move to USB-C since it is a free, open standard, as well as less waterproof than Lightning.</p><blockquote><p>We believe that USB-C is detrimental to the MFi business's profitability, and its waterproof specification is lower than Lightning and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Currently, Apple is able to strictly regulate the quality of Lightning cables and accessories through its Made for ‌iPhone‌ (MFi) program. MFi also generates a significant amount of income for the company since third-party manufacturers have to pay Apple a considerable commission to make Lightning cables or accessories.</p><p><img alt=\"iphone 5 lightning\" width=\"580\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/ITUsysXbAzASPNpI2DD-exi9XAQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/ITUsysXbAzASPNpI2DD-exi9XAQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/ITUsysXbAzASPNpI2DD-exi9XAQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/4u8qfVZ-hglIPDca6S0id8xQTbE=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/I50Exrwsn2fhSMRPw_4qbFwTuPg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/rRtysZeTbREDQ5sp4vxLleOu334=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"580px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/ITUsysXbAzASPNpI2DD-exi9XAQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/4u8qfVZ-hglIPDca6S0id8xQTbE=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/I50Exrwsn2fhSMRPw_4qbFwTuPg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/rRtysZeTbREDQ5sp4vxLleOu334=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg 2500w\"><br>Apple has used the Lightning connector on every ‌iPhone‌ since the ‌iPhone‌ 5 in 2012, but it has transitioned several of its devices to USB-C, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-announces-2020-ipad-air/\">most recently</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. With the need to connect to external drives being less pressing and some USB-C features such as external display connectivity outright impossible on an ‌iPhone‌, Apple is understandably less motivated to switch to USB-C on its most profitable product for MFi.</p><p>Transitioning the ‌iPhone‌ to USB-C this year would also leave a significant number of devices such as the entry-level <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, and a plethora of accessories such as the Magic Trackpad and ‌MagSafe‌ Duo charger, stuck with a connector that would no longer be widely used on any flagship products. Switching the ‌iPhone‌ to USB-C may, therefore, tip the scales against Lightning across Apple's product lineup, potentially forcing the company to phase out the connector entirely across a large number of products sooner than it wants to.</p><p>Amid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/iphone-13-could-remove-another-standard-feature/\">rumors of a portless iPhone</a>, Kuo clarified that Apple is more likely to switch directly to a portless model rather than first change to USB-C:</p><blockquote><p>If the ‌iPhone‌ abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt the portless design with ‌MagSafe‌ support instead of using a USB-C port.</p></blockquote><p>In spite of this, Kuo stated that ‌MagSafe‌ wireless charging technology is not yet ready to displace a wired port, having only debuted as recently as October 2020 on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup. ‌MagSafe‌ is currently unable to transfer data, complete a device recovery, or take diagnostics, which would seemingly be essential features on a future ‌iPhone‌ with no ports.</p><blockquote><p>At present, the ‌MagSafe‌ ecosystem is not mature enough, so the ‌iPhone‌ will continue to use the Lightning port in the foreseeable future.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, this means that Apple is intending <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">to stick with the Lightning connector</a> for the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> at minimum, but could well extend to models beyond that, too.</p><p>Kuo's recent spate of reports about the future of the ‌iPhone‌ included the speculation that in 2022, at least some ‌iPhone‌ models will abandon the notch and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">switch to a \"punch-hole display design\"</a> instead, and in 2023, Apple may <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/\">unveil a 7.5–8 inch foldable iPhone</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/bill-gates-prefers-android-over-iphone/\">Bill Gates Says His Preference for Android Over iPhone is Due to Pre-Installed Software</a></h3><p>Friday February 26, 2021 3:35 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates this week participated in his first meeting on Clubhouse, the increasingly popular invite-only conversation app, where he fielded a range of questions as part of an ongoing book tour.
