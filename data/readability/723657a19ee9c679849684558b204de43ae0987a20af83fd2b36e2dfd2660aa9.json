The plaintiffs are required to prove that they have suffered injury from Apple's actions in a \"concrete and particularized\" way that's not \"conjectural or hypothetical.\"</p><p>All of the allegations in the lawsuit were based on information that was included in the original story from <em>The Guardian</em> highlighting Apple's use of contractors to analyze ‌Siri‌ data, with the plaintiffs providing no proof that their own private data was accidentally collected by Apple and misused.</p><blockquote><p>The Guardian article does not plausibly suggest that all Apple's devices were subject to accidental triggers and review by third party contractors, much less that such interception always occurred in reasonably private settings. The article discusses frequency of accidental triggers primarily in relation to the Apple Watch and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> speakers, neither of which are owned by the Plaintiffs.</p><p>Moreover, the article expressly states that only a \"small portion\" of daily ‌Siri‌ activations including were sent to contractors and that they included both deliberate and accidental activations. Finally, although the article describes private communications among the recordings sent to contractors, Plaintiffs allege no facts to suggest that their own private communications were intercepted by accidental triggers.</p></blockquote><p>Though Apple's motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted, the judge in the case is allowing the consumers involved in the lawsuit to revise and refile within 20 days, so Apple is not in the clear as of yet.</p><p>Following the class action lawsuit and other negative public feedback, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/02/apple-suspending-siri-grading-program/\">temporarily suspended</a> and overhauled its ‌Siri‌ evaluation program, and in iOS 13.2, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/10/siri-privacy-options-ios-13-2/\">added an option</a> to let users delete ‌Siri‌ history <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/delete-siri-audio-history-opt-out-audio-sharing/\">and opt out</a> of sharing audio recordings.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyer’s Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
