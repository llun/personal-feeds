It wants looking into further. Yes he's been found guilty and they've come into the building, it falls on his head. Who else's head does it fall on?'</p><p>He added, 'Can we have a look into it more because what exactly happened? My son's gone into the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/british-cycling\">British Cycling</a> set up at the moment. It's like, your kid's in there and is this sort of stuff going on where \"accidentally a load of testosterone gel is coming in and no one knows\"?&nbsp;</p><p>'You're jeopardising your duty of care towards athletes and people's kids and people's husbands and wives... There needs to be more of an explanation as to who were they for then? What the bloody hell were they for?'</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9367/former-team-sky-doctor-freeman-found-guilty-of-ordering-testosterone-for-athlete\">Dr Freeman was found guilty of a number of allegations</a> by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service last Friday, including ordering 30 sachets of testosterone to the Manchester Velodrome in 2011 'with the intention of use for an athlete'.</p><p>However Wiggins cast doubt over the substance being for a rider, saying, 'I don't think for one minute they were for any rider, at all. That wasn't the type of system that was run. That wasn't the remit, it just isn't.'</p><p>He said, 'I don't know anyone in their right mind that would use that for doping in that period, particularly with the amount of testing in that time with the blood passport in-house testing, out of competition if you lived in the UK with UKAD [UK Anti-Doping].&nbsp;</p><p>'We tallied it up earlier and I was probably tested about 56 times that year.'</p><p>Ineos Grenadiers (then Team Sky), who Dr Freeman worked in part for at the time, released a statement after the guilty verdict in the same vein as Wiggins, saying, 'The team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance enhancing substance.</p><p>'No evidence has been provided that this ever happened or that there has been any wrongdoing by any athlete at any point.'</p><p>The team distanced themselves from Freeman's actions and said they will continue to support UKAD's investigation.</p></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"fd679e74b2e10c946ecd60383b4d4774de840b1680ae411caf5df2e3aec95dfd","category":"Cycling"}
