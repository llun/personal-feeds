Crosswinds in the desert led to a brief split in the pack with around 70 km to go, but things came back together in the peloton before long. The main break of the day was caught with some 25 km to go, and a solo move by <strong>Dmitriy Gruzdev</strong> was reeled in with 10 km to go.</p><p>The sprinters’ teams jockeyed for position in the closing kilometers, with BikeExchange and then Bora-Hansgrohe pushing the pace in the final kilometer. Bennett’s Deceuninck-Quick-Step teammate <strong>Michael Morkov</strong> hit the front in the last 200 meters, however, and then Bennett launched a sprint that no one could match. He took a convincing win, his second of this year’s UAE Tour, ahead of <strong>Elia Viviani</strong> and <strong>Pascal Ackermann</strong>.</p><p>Race leader <strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> finished safely in the peloton, but he and fellow UAE-Team Emirates rider <strong>Jan Polanc</strong> were both penalized 10 seconds after Polanc gave Pogacar a push in the finale. With one stage to go, Pogacar has a 35-second GC advantage over second-placed <strong>Adam Yates</strong>.</p><h3>Florian Stork fractures knee cap and ribs in UAE Tour crash</h3><p>In other news from the UAE Tour, <strong>Florian Stork</strong> crashed as he approached the finish line on stage 6, and he ultimately abandoned the race.</p><p>DSM said after the stage that the 23-year-old German had suffered a fractured knee cap and fractured ribs in the crash.</p><h3>Quinn Simmons: ‘I don’t feel like I deserved the suspension’</h3><p><strong>Quinn Simmons</strong>, who was suspended by <strong>Trek-Segafredo</strong> last year after what the team referred to as “engaging in conversation on Twitter in a way that we felt was conduct unbefitting a Trek athlete,” said on Friday that he did not feel that he deserved to be suspended, <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/quinn-simmons-i-did-not-deserve-to-be-suspended/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cyclingnews</a> reports.</p><p>The 19-year-old American was suspended after he posted a tweet with the word “Bye” and an emoji of a Black hand waving in response to a tweet from CyclingTips contributor José Been saying that supporters of Donald Trump could unfollow her.</p><p>He addressed the topic in a media appearance Friday.</p><p>“For me, I don’t feel like I deserved the suspension,” Simmons said, according to Cyclingnews. “I realize that I didn’t represent the brand in the way that I was supposed to, but to have missed the Classics and, straight up, I’m able to play a big role for the team, and I think to sacrifice that was probably, definitely, not worth it, for myself and the team.”</p><h3>Ayesha McGowan launches Thee Abundance Summit, ‘a virtual celebration of Black and Brown joy in cycling and the outdoors’</h3><p><strong>Ayesha McGowan</strong> continues to work to bolster inclusivity in cycling.

As was the case in 2020, riders and team staff will need two negative PCR tests before joining a “bubble,” and that includes those who have been vaccinated.</p><p>“Progress has been made in the fight against coronavirus, especially with the arrival of vaccines, which have given us hope that we can soon make a gradual return to a more ‘normal’ life,” UCI President David Lappartient said. “However, given that athletes and young adults are not among governments’ priorities for vaccination, we have decided, in conjunction with the steering group – which includes representatives of the riders, teams, team doctors and organizers – to maintain similarly high standards as last year, in the best interests of all parties and in expectation of better days ahead.”</p><h3>Itzulia Basque Country unveils 2021 route</h3><p>Organizers of the <strong>Itzulia Basque Country</strong> have unveiled the route of this year’s race, which is set to start with a 13.9 km time trial in Bilbao on April 5.</p><p>Following the opening TT, the race will take on plenty of climbing challenges, among them the Ermualde climb that closes out stage 3, the Jaizkibel and Erlaitz climbs that feature towards the end of stage 4, and the seven categorized climbs on tap for the sixth and final stage to Arrate.</p><h2>Coming up …</h2><p>Saturday will be a busy day for bike racing.
