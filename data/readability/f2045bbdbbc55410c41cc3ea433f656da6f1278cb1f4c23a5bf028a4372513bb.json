{"title":"Buttondown: Newsletter Service That Allows Opting Out of Tracking","link":"https://buttondown.email/","date":1614360331000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><h2>The easiest way to <span><span id=\"verb\">run</span><span>|</span></span> your newsletter.</h2><p>Buttondown is a small, elegant tool for producing newsletters.</p><p>The minimalist interface makes it easy for you to write great emails; the automation acts like the editorial assistant you wish you had, by checking for typos, broken links, or malformed images; the portable subscription widget makes it really easy to grow your audience from wherever you host your site.</p><p>And then Buttondown gets out of your way. Buttondown's emphasis is on speed and ease of use over complex featuresets or powerful automation.</p><video muted=\"muted\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://d1tw14ffyig9rt.cloudfront.net/static/images/poster.png\"><source src=\"https://d1tw14ffyig9rt.cloudfront.net/static/images/screenshots/demo.mp4\"></video><h2>Built for people like you.</h2><p>I had been writing my own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://newsletter.jmduke.com/\" title=\"null\">personal newsletter</a> for years but struggled with how other tools worked. Simple tasks like cleaning up Markdown, checking links, resizing images, and making sure the email looked right was a <em>huge hassle</em>. It took me away from doing the fun part: <strong>writing a great newsletter</strong>.</p><p>I needed a simple, pleasant tool that took the annoying stuff off of my plate. I also wanted something that was for people like me: not a tool that was really built for big commercial sites or complex editorial teams, but for a small user who wanted to spend more time writing than dealing with an interface.</p><h2>Just enough features.</h2><div><div><p><img src=\"https://buttondown.email/static/images/icons/trending-up.svg\"></p><h3>Third-party integrations</h3><p>Setting up your Buttondown account to work with Zapier, IFTTT, Weebly, Squarespace, Ghost, and more.</p><p><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/features/integrations\">Read more →</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://buttondown.email/static/images/icons/dolar.svg\"></p><h3>Paid subscriptions</h3><p>Buttondown makes it easy and painless for you to get paid for your newsletters.
