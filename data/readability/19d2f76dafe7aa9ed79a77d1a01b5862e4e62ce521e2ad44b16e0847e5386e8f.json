Also, the company announced that a much-anticipated Showtime show will end up on Paramount+ instead.</p><p>Paramount+, which was announced several months ago, will launch on March 4 in the United States, Canada, and 18 Latin American countries. As with CBS All Access, both an ad-supported and ad-free plan will be offered. In the US, the ad-supported one will cost $4.99 per month, while the ad-free plan will cost $9.99.</p><p>That $4.99 per month is $1 cheaper than the ad-supported version of CBS All Access. However, this cheaper plan will not include local CBS stations. The service is also expected to launch in Nordic countries within a few weeks, and in Australia sometime later this year.</p><p>When it launches, Paramount+ will have 2,500 films and 30,000 TV episodes, according to ViacomCBS executives. That will include some original series, many of which will be available in 4K and Dolby Vision HDR.</p><p>Original series will include those we've already seen on CBS All Access, including the large slate of <em>Star Trek</em> shows such as <em>Discovery</em>, <em>Picard</em>, and <em>Lower Decks</em>.</p><p>Two new <em>Star Trek</em> series have recently been announced: a CG animated kids' show called <a href=\"https://www.startrek.com/news/breaking-star-trek-prodigy-first-look\"><em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em></a>, and a spinoff about Captain Pike and Mr. Spock called <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. <em>Prodigy</em> was planned for airing on Nickelodeon (which is owned by the Viacom part of ViacomCBS) and it will still air there, but it will appear on Paramount+ first.</p><p>Additionally, it has been confirmed that the long-anticipated and much delayed series based on the video game franchise <em>Halo</em> will be delivered via Paramount+; it was originally planned as a Showtime series. The <em>Halo</em> series has Steven Spielberg as an executive producer, and it is planned for the first quarter of 2022. According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/\">Deadline</a>, shooting was well underway when the pandemic forced a shutdown. Amidst the break, it was decided to move the show to the broad-audience Paramount+ service rather than \"adult\" and \"sophisticated\" Showtime. (Those descriptors were used by Showtime exec David Nevins to describe the network.)</p><p>Other content includes a Frasier reboot, as well as some 2021 theatrical film releases like <em>Mission Impossible 7</em>.</p></div></div>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19d2f76dafe7aa9ed79a77d1a01b5862e4e62ce521e2ad44b16e0847e5386e8f","category":"Tech"}
