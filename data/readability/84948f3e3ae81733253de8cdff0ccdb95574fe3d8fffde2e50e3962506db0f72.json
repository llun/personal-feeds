Gurman says Apple is considering “a rubberized exterior” that would be more resistant to scratches than the current aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium options.</p><p>The report states Apple is looking to bring “extra impact-resistance&nbsp;and protection” to compete with rugged watches from Casio and Luminox. Casio’s G-Shock watches are particularly popular among military personnel and hard-core athletes, with up to 200 meters of water resistance, a protruding bezel to absorbs shocks, and protective cushioning of the crystal oscillator and other critical parts internal parts to prevent “contact failure and malfunction.”</p><p>Gurman also says Apple is working on new swim tracking feature for the next iteration of the Apple Watch.</p><p>Bloomberg’s report notes that Apple previously considered a rugged smartwatch after its launch in 2015 but scrapped those plans. He cautions that this model could “ultimately be canceled or delayed.” There are already <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?ots=1&amp;k=apple+watch+rugged+case&amp;#038;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;#038;tag=macworld05-20?tag=macworld05-20\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=apple+watch+rugged+case&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=macworld05-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">numerous third-party cases that claim to offer rugged shock protection</a> with tens of thousands of five-star reviews on Amazon.</p><p>Also, this week, a patent was spotted by Macrumors that shows a “flexible display panel in both the watch face area and band may be adjusted to conform to the wrist size of the user.” A flexible wraparound display would offer far more functionality and customization than currently possible on the Apple Watch but is likely many years away from production.&nbsp;</p></div><p><em>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
