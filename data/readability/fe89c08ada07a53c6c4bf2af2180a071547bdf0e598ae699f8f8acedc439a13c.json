New ideas are found at the intersections, and we believe there’s a compelling one between music and the economy. Making the economy work for artists is similar to what Square has done for sellers.</span></p></div></div></article></div><div><article role=\"article\" data-focusable=\"true\" tabindex=\"0\"><div data-testid=\"tweet\"><div><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/jack\" role=\"link\" data-focusable=\"true\"><div aria-label=\"\"><p><img alt=\"\" draggable=\"true\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1115644092329758721/AFjOr-K8_normal.jpg\"></p></div></a></div><div><p><span>Square started 12 years ago by giving small sellers a simple tool in order to participate more fully in the economy and grow.

It's refreshing and right.
