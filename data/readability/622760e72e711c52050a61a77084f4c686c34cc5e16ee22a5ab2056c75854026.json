Our fight, our commitment, our goals are difficult to get, but we can do it together. I need the support of all the team.”</p><p>The 27-year-old Italian joined the team for the second time in 2019. He turned pro with Cannondale in 2014, the year before the Slipstream organization acquired that team, and then rode with the Cannondale-Garmin squad through 2017 before spending one year with BMC. Upon his return to the Slipstream team, he promptly won his first pro race, which also happened to be a Monument.</p><p>In addition to contending for EF in one-day races, Bettiol has been a valuable contributor the team’s Grand Tour squads. He was a reliable support rider for Hugh Carthy at the recent Giro and also nabbed a stage victory of his own in the race.</p><p>As of Tuesday, he will be sticking with EF through at least next season, although the duration of the new deal remains unknown as EF typically does not announce the length of contract extensions.</p><p>“I still would like to win more races,” Bettiol said. “I want to win more important races, and with my help to win a Grand Tour. I was close to it with Rigo [Urán] three years ago. I think we can do it. I will fight myself to get more victories, but also for the team to get a big Grand Tour win.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"622760e72e711c52050a61a77084f4c686c34cc5e16ee22a5ab2056c75854026","category":"Cycling"}
