Gear choice was a big talking point from the start with a whole variety of combinations on show, from TT bikes and climbing helmets to road bikes with disc wheels, and even a handful of clip-on tri bars. </p><p>Riding in full TT mode, Rigoberto Urán obliterated the next fastest time at the top of the climb and maintained his advantage on the descent, taking his first victory in three years. Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-QuickStep) raced his road bike to second and Gino Mäder (Bahrain-Victorious) came third, a fraction of a second faster than race leader Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers).</p><p>The GC competition was close going into stage 7, and is closer still after the time trial, with a significant reorganisation at the top of the standings. Carapaz is still in the yellow jersey, but Urán is now behind by just 17 seconds and Alaphilippe moves up to third.</p><div><div><p>Tour de Suisse (2.UWT) <span>Disentis Sedrun → Andermatt</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/cc/rigoberto-uran-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c0b9b0cf9fd1462a6a6c47ca720749d08fec51e40388f77bfca65ae0bf03fe70","category":"Cycling"}
