This is certainly the case when compared to the 2020 campaign which was decimated due to the global pandemic.

However, it now seems that we may be without Paris-Roubaix for the second successive year.</span></p><p><span>Paris-Roubaix was due to take place on Sunday 11th April 2021. However,</span><span>&nbsp;French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a month-long lockdown across multiple regions of France including Paris last Thursday.</span></p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><p><span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a>&nbsp;</strong></em><br></span></p><p><span>Speaking to France Bleu earlier today, Michel Lalande,&nbsp;</span><span>who is the prefect of the Hauts-de-France region which encompasses Roubaix was asked about Paris-Roubaix. “</span><span>I'll give you an answer when the time is right, but you can guess it”, said Laland.</span></p><p><span><span>All WorldTour races have gone ahead in 2021 thus far, including Paris-Nice. Paris-Roubaix was far from the only event to fall to the pandemic last year, though. Other WorldTour events that were cancelled include the Volta Catalunya, Amstel Gold Race and the Tour de Romandie. However, the Volta Catalunya has returned to the calendar in 2021 and is taking place across the final week of March.</span></span></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB2_5873_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616433052\" alt=\"Roubaix Velodrome 2019\"><em>Paris-Roubaix, 2019 (Alex Broadway/SWpix)</em></p><p><span>Despite this news, the Belgian Classics are expected to continue as expected. When asked on this matter, Lalande responded, “<span>Someone will have to explain to me the coherence between the safety precaution for COVID. Someone will have to explain it to me.\"</span></span><span>&nbsp;Clearly, Lalande was surprised that&nbsp;racing in Belgium is set to continue amidst the pandemic.</span></p><p><span>We were set to witness the inaugural Women’s Paris-Roubaix in 2020, yet this was&nbsp;delayed&nbsp;by a year&nbsp;due to the pandemic. Potential postponement of this year’s event means the first women’s Paris-Roubaix may have to wait until a later date, be it later this year or in 2022.</span></p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gallery-milan-san-remo-2021\">Related – Milan-San Remo 2021 Gallery</a></strong></em></p><p><span>The next step is awaiting official confirmation of the race’s postponement/cancellation which can be expected following Lalande’s comments. However, we cannot be sure whether The Hell of the North will be rearranged for a later date in 2021, or whether we will be forced to wait until 2022.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbleunord/status/1373899235633020929\"><span></span></a><span>Adding to his earlier comments, Lalande said, “The sky now looks less blue”. Many would’ve hoped for the clouds to show themselves on the day of Paris-Roubaix, rain can often shake up the race making it more unpredictable.</span></p><p><span>In this sense, though, we hope that somehow the sky will remain blue and we will see Paris-Roubaix at some point this season.</span></p></div></div>","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"d78468208b505fb156c2ecf244e1850d86df4984447e182a33271356a7a150b4","category":"Cycling"}
