Monica is an amateur cyclist herself, while Paolo is an amateur triathlete, so they know first-hand what to look for in women’s cycling apparel.</p><p>The two women reflect on the evolution of their business:</p><p>‘We have been producing women-specific products for at least 22 years,’ Monica says. ‘Our goal since the outset has been to give women the same technical and performance fabrics that we make for men’s clothing, though with more body-hugging cuts designed for women’s body shapes, and playing around a bit more with the graphics.</p><blockquote><p>I remember the first trade shows I did, where people were looking at me and thinking, 'She’s blond, young and female. What does she know about cycling?' But I have always proved them wrong</p></blockquote><p>‘We have produced the World Champions’ rainbow jersey for the UCI since 1988. These jerseys are now available to amateurs via the Santini website.</p><p>‘Replica versions are also available from Santini, and exclusively in Decathlon stores in Italy, Belgium, Hungary and Switzerland.</p><p>‘For Santini and the UCI, the launch of this new collection aims to make cycling more accessible to a broader public, including beginners. This reflects our desire to raise awareness of the joy of cycling and to attract more people to all forms of cycling.’</p><p>Despite their drive to take the company forward, however, the sisters still recognise the role family has had in bringing Santini to where it is today. ‘Dad is still our president and the symbol of our company,’ Paola says.</p><p>‘He comes to work every day and loves to walk around the factory and see what’s going on. He no longer makes the decisions, but we like to get him involved and ask his opinion.</p><p>‘In my opinion, a woman’s life is like an endurance sport, like cycling. So we are used to dealing with endurance and with the complexities of managing a company like ours.</p><p>‘The cycling industry has changed a lot through the years. There are still relatively few of us but our numbers are growing.</p><p>‘I remember the first trade shows I did, where people were looking at me and thinking, “She’s blond, young and female. What does she know about cycling?” But I have always proved them wrong.’</p><p>Their role spearheading the day-to-day operation of the company saw the Santini sisters facing an unprecedented challenge in 2020 with the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>‘In mid-March 2020, we put production of our technical cycle wear on hold and converted to making facemasks as part of a process that involved other companies in our local area, and with the support of certification bodies.</p><p>‘It was an ethical and moral decision because we knew that there was a huge need for this type of PPE in hospitals and businesses. We wanted to give a helping hand and make our own contribution during the very difficult time, for our hometown of Bergamo and the whole of Italy last spring.</p><p>‘We developed various prototypes and received approval from the [technical university] <i>Politecnico di Milano </i>then got the go-ahead from the <i>Istituto Superiore di Sanità</i> (Italy’s national institute of health) for the single-use SP MASK T1 TYPE II.&nbsp;</p><p>‘We also produced washable filter facemasks, which were first worn by athletes at the 2020 World Road Race Championships [at Imola].’</p><p><strong>Find the rest of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/zwift-womens-history-month\"><em>Cyclist's 31 Inspirational Women</em></a>&nbsp;here</strong></p><p>‘I am President of Confindustria Services in Bergamo (the operational arm of the chamber of commerce),’ Monica says.</p><p>‘Women are well represented in business in Bergamo, and I believe it is important for women to be in managerial positions because they bring different perspectives and management styles to the mix than men.</p><p>‘Italian gender laws have helped increase the number of women in executive positions in business, but I think we still have too few women in leadership roles in Italy compared to the European average.</p><p>‘Personally, I believe that policies to allow women to work whilst caring for children and elderly relatives are fundamental.</p><p>‘I am proud to work in a female-led company with a 90% female workforce. At first, people were reluctant to accept our ideas. They said, “What are you doing that for? Why are you making women’s products? They are no use to anyone; no one wants them. It’s a waste of time.”</p><p>‘But time has proved us right: there are more and more women’s collections and that is because more and more women are becoming involved in this sport.&nbsp;</p><p>‘When I am at work, I never see myself as a woman, but as a professional with goals. Even when people reacted oddly, I never thought they were doing so because I was a woman, but because they thought I was young or a bit green.</p><p>‘The important thing is to never give in to the sceptics.’</p><p><strong>For more from Zwift this International Women's Month</strong>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5632488676&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">visit here</a></p></div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"81bcbbecd69d83e13403105acda8b679cc13f573148d4f1aca0fc469dcea096f","category":"Cycling"}
