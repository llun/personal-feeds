{"title":"Canyon launches in Canada","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/canyon-launches-in-canada/","date":1615915446000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>Direct-to-consumer powerhouse Canyon continues its march toward its goal of world domination with its announcement today that it’s now entered the Canadian market, effective immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the US market, where Canyon manages a dedicated subsidiary in San Diego, California, Canyon will handle its new Canadian operations directly from its global headquarters in Koblenz, Germany. The company is offering “a portfolio of bikes specifically adapted to the anticipated demands of the Canadian market,” including road, gravel, mountain, gravity, triathlon, and urban categories, however, all of those bikes will be shipped from Germany via UPS. E-bikes are notably excluded from the list pending battery import logistics (and the higher-end Aeroad models are being held pending the resolution of its seatpost and handlebar issues) but there’s otherwise a 1-2 week claimed delivery time.</p><p>Although the company’s direct-to-consumer business model obviously offers benefits in terms of retail pricing as compared to traditional distribution channels — discounts often hover around the 20-30% mark for comparable spec — the lack of a network of physical brick-and-mortar dealers will obviously be concerning. However, as in some other markets, Canyon has partnered with mobile outfit Velofix to provide on-site service and warranty support in case you need some help. There’s also the company’s usual no-questions-asked 30-day return policy.&nbsp;</p><p>“Velofix mechanics are trained by us and have access to the right parts to fix your Canyon bike,” read Canyon’s latest press release. “Velofix also provides expert help on everything to do with maintenance, warranty, guarantee, repair, and assembly. It goes without saying that you can also take your Canyon to your local bike shop for repairs if you want to.”</p><p>Phone-based customer support will also be available in both English and French. However, just as the bikes are being shipped from Germany, Canyon is handling this aspect from Koblenz as well, and the available hours are decided limited given the time difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested?
