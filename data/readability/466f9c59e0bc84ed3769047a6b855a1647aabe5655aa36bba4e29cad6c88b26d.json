Apple plans to force app developers to ask users before accessing the advertising identifier (IDFA) on user devices for ad tracking purposes, with the requirement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-app-store-review-guidelines-tracking/\">to be enforced</a> when iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/28/app-tracking-transparency-required-soon/\">are released</a>.</p><p>Apple has clarified that the opt-out options <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/apple-responds-to-facebook-tracking-criticism/\">apply to all developers</a> who track users, including Apple, but Apple will not need to use the pop ups asking for permission because its advertising platform does not track users.</p><p>Vestager told <em>Reuters</em> that thus far, she has not received complaints about Apple's changes, and that she thinks it's a good move for privacy. \"It is a very good thing to have a clear opt-out option. If you look at the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, these are some of the solutions we are looking at there,\" she said.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/macbook-pro-copy-iphone-design/\">New MacBook Pro Expected to Copy Familiar iPhone Design</a></h3><p>Apple's upcoming 2021 MacBook Pro is expected to take design cues from the iPhone 12, according to well-respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
