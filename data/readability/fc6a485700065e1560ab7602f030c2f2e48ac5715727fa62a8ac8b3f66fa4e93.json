Jobs filled out the application in hopes of landing a job after dropping out of Reed College, which he attended for around six months. A year later in 1974, Jobs joined Atari as a technician, where he later joined forces with Steve Wozniak to create Apple in 1976.</p><p>In the document, which previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/16/steve-jobs-employment-questionnaire-auction/\">sold for $175,000</a> three years ago, Jobs highlighted \"English lit\" as his major while also listing \"electronics tech\" and \"design engineer\" as special abilities and interests. Jobs also listed his skills in computers and calculators.</p><p>The listing for the document says it is in \"very good condition,\" with \"light staining and old clear tape to the top edge.\" To prove it's the real deal written by Steve Jobs himself, it comes with letters and certificates of authenticity.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\">Apple Adds FaceTime Framework to Apple TV/HomePod Amid Speaker With Screen Rumors</a></h3><p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today revealed that Apple has been developing new speakers that are equipped with \"screens and cameras,\" suggesting we could see a future HomePod-like device that has a built-in display and camera feature for FaceTiming and other functions.
