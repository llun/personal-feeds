For each SIM swap, the co-conspirator sent DeFiore the customer’s phone number, a four-digit PIN, and a SIM card number to which that phone number was to be swapped, prosecutors said.</p><p>The charges come eight months after federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/california-resident-charged-role-sim-swap-scam-targeting-least-20-people-including-ne-0\">charged</a> Richard Yuan Li of Hercules, California, with conspiracy to commit fraud for his alleged role in a SIM swap scam that targeted at least twenty people. Li was in possession of an iPhone 8 which the number of at least one of DeFiore's victims was routed to, prosecutors said.</p><p>The alleged victim was a New Orleans-area medical doctor with cryptocurrency accounts at exchanges including Binance, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini, Poloniex, ItBit, and Neo Wallet. Li and his co-conspirators then allegedly accessed the physician’s email and cryptocurrency accounts and stole a “significant portion” of the victim’s holdings.</p><p>Prosecutors went on to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/press-release/file/1283771/download\">allege</a> that even after the doctor recovered the phone account, Li or one of his co-conspirators called the doctor to say he had viewed images in the doctor’s Gmail account and balances in the doctor’s cryptocurrency accounts. The caller then demanded 100 bitcoins, worth about $640,000 at the time, in exchange for not publishing the photos or stealing the cryptocurrency.</p><p>Prosecutors didn’t identify the phone company DeFiore worked for, but <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-defiore-894072147/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this LinkedIn profile</a> lists a Stephen DiFiore who works as a Verizon customer service representative in Brandon, Florida. Verizon representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment for this story. Attempts to reach DeFiore weren't successful.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/defiore-linkedin-profile.jpg\" data-height=\"372\" data-width=\"779\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/defiore-linkedin-profile-640x306.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/defiore-linkedin-profile.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p>LinkedIn</p></figcaption></figure><p>This week’s charges come as so-called SIM swapping crimes continue to proliferate, motivated in large part by criminals’ attempts to obtain large amounts of cryptocurrency in online accounts. Once a perpetrator obtains control over victims’ phone accounts, the perp typically uses that access to complete account resets for email accounts and from there resets passwords for other accounts.</p><p>If convicted, DeFiore faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Earlier this week, European officials announced the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/authorities-bust-sim-swap-ring-they-say-took-millions-from-the-rich-and-famous/\">arrests of 10 individuals</a> in connection with a series of SIM-swapping attacks that reaped more than $100 million.</p></div></div>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a1f2c8e8f86d1e1fc49cc1dbf6f9a3bcaf87064d527549e34068bc5f5439153","category":"Tech"}
