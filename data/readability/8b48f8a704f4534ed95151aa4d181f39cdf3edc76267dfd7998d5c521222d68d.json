The battery health status on affected notebooks will indicate \"Service Recommended.\" To identify your Mac model, click on the Apple logo in the top-left corner of the screen and click on About This Mac. The following models may be impacted by this issue:</p><blockquote><p>- MacBook Pro (13­-inch, 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)<br>- MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports)<br>- MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)<br>- MacBook Pro (13-­inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)<br>- MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2016)<br>- MacBook Pro (15-­inch, 2017)</p></blockquote><p>If your MacBook Pro exhibits this behavior, Apple says to contact the company for a battery replacement, free of charge. Apple says it will examine the notebook prior to service to verify that it is eligible for the free replacement.</p><p>If your MacBook Pro has not exhibited this issue, updating to macOS Big Sur 11.2.1 as soon as possible is still highly recommended as a precaution. There is also a macOS Catalina 10.15.7 Supplemental Update that prevents the issue.</p><p>macOS Big Sur users can determine if their battery needs service by opening the System Preferences app, clicking Battery, selecting Battery in the sidebar, and clicking Battery Health. On macOS Catalina or earlier, users can hold the Option key and click the battery icon in the menu bar to reveal the battery status menu.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyer’s Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
