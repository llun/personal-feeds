As component makers have machined away more &amp; more material to shed weight from their own parts, carbon bars have taken the brunt of more uneven clamping forces. So, Beast dove deep into analyzing the impacts of those less uniform forces, and is reinforcing all of their MTB bars to greatly improve safety at the cost of just a few grams…</p><h2>Beast Flat &amp;

distribute pressure unevenly on the bar. Contact areas a reduced so forces are increased. Even more conventional, lower-end clamps can often be irregular in shape or poorly formed, resulting in uneven pinching at the bar.</p><p>And carbon fibers don’t like that.</p><figure

Pop the brakes off to check that there isn’t any visible damage in the clamping area. And use minimal torque when clamping them back. It seems many bar makers recommend a max 1.5Nm for lightweight clamp designs.</p><h3>Tech details – What’s new &amp; How the v2.0 bars are better!</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Beast MTB Flatbar 2.0 Riser Bars 2.0, lightweight reinforced carbon mountain bike handlebars,&nbsp;ends\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11123149/Beast-MTB-Flatbar-2-Riser-Bar-2_lightweight-carbon-reinforced-mountain-bike-handlebars_clamp-area-detail-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>To solve the pinching problem while still producing a lightweight carbon bar, Beast redesigned the elaborate fiber layup at the clamping area and now includes a new high-strength reinforcing polyester mesh.
