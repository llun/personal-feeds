Yet Google itself is now telling users that their own apps are out of date.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1242\" height=\"2208\" src=\"https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434.jpeg 1242w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-576x1024.jpeg 576w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-768x1365.jpeg 768w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-864x1536.jpeg 864w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-1152x2048.jpeg 1152w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-982x1746.jpeg 982w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_4434-225x400.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086.png 750w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086-169x300.png 169w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086-576x1024.png 576w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6086-225x400.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></p><p><em>I verified that this warning is showing up for multiple apps (Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Maps). Multiple iPhones on iOS 14.4, owned by separate account holders, were tested.</em></p><p>About an hour ago, I opened my Gmail app to find that some of my accounts had been logged out. When I tried logging back in, Google informed me that “This app is out of date.” <em>Indeed!</em></p><p>Google has not pushed updates to their flagship apps including Gmail and Google Maps since before a Dec. 8 deadline, imposed by Apple, that mandated all app updates include new privacy labels. The “nutrition labels” describe<strong> </strong>to users all the ways developers collect data about them, which has been awkward for companies like Facebook, whose business model relies on the company knowing as much about its users as possible. Tweets have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1339174301564604418\">gone viral</a> for simply scrolling through the long privacy label section for apps like Facebook. Other companies, hoping to avoid such shame have allegedly <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/210129/p6#a210129p6\">misled users about their collection practices</a>.</p><p>Alphabet/Google has taken a third approach, which is to indefinitely stall on pushing updates to its iOS apps. But the company itself tried to play down this popular theory. Over a month ago, on Jan. 5, it claimed it would add Apple’s privacy labels to its apps <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/210127/p22#a210127p22\">“this week or the next week”</a>. As Macrumors noted, some of its apps like YouTube <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/\">have quietly received updates,</a> but not Chrome, Maps, Photos, or Gmail. While Google stalls on pushing updates to its apps, it’s notable that its rivals like Apple Maps, are continuing to innovate <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=google+maps+ios+update&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis0eqlueDuAhUGna0KHTSVDJsQ_AUoAXoECBUQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=796&amp;dpr=2\">with new features in their apps</a>.</p><p>After saying “This app is out of date”, its warning goes on to say “You should update this app.” <em>We can’t.</em> “The version you’re using doesn’t include the latest security features to keep you protected. Only continue if you understand the risks.” <em>Let’s hope that’s not true! </em>If you visit the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480\">Gmail app’s page</a> directly, you will see its last update was released on Dec. 1.</p><p>Presumably, the warning is triggered by an automatic check of how long its been since the app has been updated. In this case, it’s been over 2 months. But only Google can resolve that situation. Here’s a video of Google’s warning being triggered:</p><figure><p><iframe title=\"Google itself is now telling users their apps are out of date, despite no updates being available\" width=\"663\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rt4ftLVVDQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p></figure><p>(I guess there’s a possibility that as I push publish on this post, Google is mid-update on a global rollout of fresh updates for its flagship apps. But I think that chance is slim, as Apple’s “Phased Release” option lets users immediately receive app updates if they visit an app’s store page directly.)</p><p>Looking at the bigger picture: If Google really decided to intentionally delay updating its apps over adding privacy labels, it’s honestly hard to believe that such short-term thinking prevails in its leadership. They inevitably put themselves in a Streisand-effect situation, where in the end they’d attract more attention to themselves. Whereas if they had published early, the media’s attention would have been split across all of Big Tech’s apps. While the alleged decision itself was always doomed to end poorly, this “app out of date” interstitial is just an epic self own. I guess the decision to delay apps was not handled well internally, because such choices are probably uncommon and the processes to carry them out aren’t as battle-tested or familiar.</p><p>On the matter of <em>if </em>Google is really delaying its apps over concerns about privacy labels, it really <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/\">wants us to believe that’s not the reason</a>, telling Techcrunch that the labels were rolling out last month, yet as with Gmail’s app – the labels are still not available:</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6096.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6096.png 750w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6096-169x300.png 169w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6096-576x1024.png 576w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_6096-225x400.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"></p><p>We’ll see what happens…</p></div></article></main></div></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"82f7f8538de2a61541fef4b2cb136145b37c153831fcf6a01c0b5e145dc8792c","category":"Tech"}
