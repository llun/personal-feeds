Thanks to Apple's purchase of Beats in 2014, products such as the ‌Powerbeats Pro‌ have enjoyed deep integration with iOS and macOS. However, they have lacked support for the ‌Find My‌ app.</p><p>With iOS and iPadOS 14.5, users will be able to locate and keep track of their Bluetooth earbuds right from within the ‌Find My‌ app. Currently, Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-sa/HT209590\">says</a> that if ‌Powerbeats Pro‌ are lost, customers should contact Apple Support, making the process of finding them lengthy.</p><p>Like ‌AirPods‌, users will be able to trigger a sound to play from the ‌Powerbeats Pro‌ to locate them. All in all, the new integration helps blur the line between the software experience for Apple's ‌AirPods‌ line and the Beats brand.</p><p>iOS and iPadOS 14.5, expected in the early spring, has quickly become the most significant update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> since its launch in September.
