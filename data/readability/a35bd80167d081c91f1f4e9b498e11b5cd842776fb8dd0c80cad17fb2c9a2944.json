Fiat Chrysler, which merged with Groupe PSA earlier this year to become Stellantis, is now starting to roll out its next-generation infotainment system, Uconnect 5, and I recently had an opportunity to test it out on a 2021 Chrysler Pacifica.</p><p><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/93OzFVYwRwe0rDvRV368EwY3n1c=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021.jpg?lossy\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/93OzFVYwRwe0rDvRV368EwY3n1c=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/0CUJNkV3NlZe3Uj-7YUpo_2pNZ4=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/yvwltbfx3vGeCo1y8ZngWSAH4R8=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/tgSly3OCLPXSD1tupI6ktu7DWaA=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021.jpg 2500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px\" alt=\"pacifica 2021\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"><br>Uconnect 5 was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/07/2021-chrysler-pacifica-wireless-carplay/\">announced just over a year ago</a>, but it's still in the early stages of making its way into updated models, and the Pacifica was the first to gain the new system. Uconnect 5 on the Pacifica runs on a nice 10.1-inch infotainment screen that's standard on all trims, although built-in TomTom navigation requires a higher-level trim or package beyond the standard Uconnect 5 system.</p><p>One of the key new features of Uconnect 5 is support for wireless ‌CarPlay‌, which has so far been limited to just a few largely premium brands but is starting to roll out much more broadly as an increasing number of manufacturers have undertaken revamps of their infotainment hardware and software.</p><p><img alt=\"pacifica 2021 carplay home screen\" width=\"1600\" height=\"857\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/kojyFt9xO01xusuzyT9skNjaE3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/kojyFt9xO01xusuzyT9skNjaE3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/kojyFt9xO01xusuzyT9skNjaE3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ElLMZj9fQ74CB_a1gIOPyWiI3E4=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/7_z0psqExncM1gP9m-uVGdGXXjo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/esVP2gqftJLR3UFBvIilAkvtawY=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"748px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/kojyFt9xO01xusuzyT9skNjaE3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ElLMZj9fQ74CB_a1gIOPyWiI3E4=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/7_z0psqExncM1gP9m-uVGdGXXjo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/esVP2gqftJLR3UFBvIilAkvtawY=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-home-screen.jpg 2500w\"><em>‌CarPlay‌ Home screen</em></p><p>As with Uconnect 4, I found the new Uconnect 5 system to do an excellent job of integrating ‌CarPlay‌, leaving a persistent, customizable menu bar along the bottom of the display and a thin status bar at the top, even while turning the majority of the display over to ‌CarPlay‌. The result is a nice level of integration, allowing you to easily jump back and forth between ‌CarPlay‌ and the rest of the Uconnect system as needed.</p><p>The menu bar along the bottom allows for a dedicated ‌CarPlay‌ icon once your phone is connected, and you can reorder the icons to suit your preferences. Regardless of whether you're in ‌CarPlay‌ or the main Uconnect system, the top status bar offers glanceable information like time and outdoor temperature, as well as configurable quick-access icons for features like climate control (manual climate controls are also available) and the interior \"FamCam\" that lets you keep an eye on kids wherever they're sitting.</p><p>Wireless ‌CarPlay‌ setup is extremely simple, requiring just a few taps in settings on the Uconnect system and on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to get the pairing confirmed. From that point on, ‌CarPlay‌ is a seamless experience, automatically connecting quite quickly once the vehicle is turned on, and I never experienced any lag or glitches over the wireless connection in my testing.</p><p><img alt=\"pacifica 2021 carplay music\" width=\"1600\" height=\"948\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mMiBBdBvST8-RSHdgTZhtE99zl8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mMiBBdBvST8-RSHdgTZhtE99zl8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mMiBBdBvST8-RSHdgTZhtE99zl8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_LptYzceJruQ5LMkqmL0QMQOkZw=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/tf-MxqlXV0d1tH6JpgBGLZxOLKo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/boUDyLZDfG4Sej6S7NGPHIeB88k=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mMiBBdBvST8-RSHdgTZhtE99zl8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_LptYzceJruQ5LMkqmL0QMQOkZw=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/tf-MxqlXV0d1tH6JpgBGLZxOLKo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/boUDyLZDfG4Sej6S7NGPHIeB88k=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-carplay-music.jpg 2500w\"><em>‌CarPlay‌ \"Now Playing\" screen</em></p><p>That snappy performance was evident throughout the Uconnect 5 system, with FCA saying that the new hardware that comes with Uconnect 5 has five times the processing power of Uconnect 4 systems. I also found the screen to be high-quality with vivid colors. Overall, the Uconnect 5 system offers a clean, modern layout that will remain familiar to those who have used the previous version.</p><p>Uconnect 5 does come with a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> experience that supports multiple pages, customizable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>, and more, giving you a quick glance at your most important types of information, although this is less useful is you're a heavy ‌CarPlay‌ user. With the ability to configure up to five user profiles, preferences such as media, climate settings, and seating and mirror positions can be customized for different drivers.

Built-in vacuums are becoming increasingly popular in minivans, and they're very handy for taking care of messes without needing to haul out a separate vacuum from the inside the house, garage, or basement. Stow 'n Vac is standard on the Limited and Pinnacle trims and included in that Uconnect Theater Family Group package on the Touring L trim.</p><p><img alt=\"pacifica 2021 instrument cluster\" width=\"1600\" height=\"825\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/E28QA3CnUoS0Zp1G5SFqtMkHI18=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/E28QA3CnUoS0Zp1G5SFqtMkHI18=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/E28QA3CnUoS0Zp1G5SFqtMkHI18=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/D6nHHX7qRP6noPoZr-uZrBv60YQ=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Bm1jpCZ1ZxUWrn0U1cvcKzimnr8=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/wunTJ3Z8NeZDaepcn4zLRkvIPxo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/E28QA3CnUoS0Zp1G5SFqtMkHI18=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/D6nHHX7qRP6noPoZr-uZrBv60YQ=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Bm1jpCZ1ZxUWrn0U1cvcKzimnr8=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/wunTJ3Z8NeZDaepcn4zLRkvIPxo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/pacifica-2021-instrument-cluster.jpg 2500w\"><em>Instrument cluster with 7-inch customizable info display</em></p><p>While my test 2021 Chrysler Pacifica was a Premium AWD trim coming in at a smidge under $50,000 (there's an even higher Pinnacle trim for a few thousand more), even the base Touring trim starting at just over $35,000 gets the 10.1-inch screen with wireless ‌CarPlay‌.</p><p>Infotainment systems have increasingly become focal points for car buyers, so I really appreciate the uniformity across Pacifica trims and I'd like to see more manufacturers offering high-quality infotainment systems and handy features like wireless ‌CarPlay‌ across all trim levels.</p><p>Wireless phone charging remains more of a high-end option, and sometimes a quite expensive one. As seen on the Pacifica, the availability of wireless charging is sometimes linked to other features like higher-end console designs, which is understandable, but I remain hopeful that it will roll out more broadly across models and trims, particularly as wireless ‌CarPlay‌ and Android Auto proliferate and more customers demand an all-wireless experience.</p></div></div>","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a35bd80167d081c91f1f4e9b498e11b5cd842776fb8dd0c80cad17fb2c9a2944","category":"Apple"}
