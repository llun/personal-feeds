This rumor certainly sounds plausible, as the new iPad Pro models are expected to be equipped with a faster A14X chip based on the M1 chip in the latest Macs, and the M1 chip supports Thunderbolt. And since Thunderbolt uses the USB-C connector design, the new iPad Pro models would still work with existing USB-C chargers and accessories.</p><p>As widely rumored, Gurman said Apple is looking to include Mini-LED backlighting on the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro at a minimum, suggesting that the display technology might be exclusive to the larger model.</p><p>Well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo lent credence to this timeframe, claiming that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/\">mass production of Mini-LED iPads will begin in mid-to-late April</a>. Kuo expects a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-macbook-air-mini-led-2020-launch/\">new MacBook Air with a Mini-LED display</a> and potentially a new iPad Air with an OLED display to follow in 2022.<br></p><h2>Apple Event in April? Recapping the Latest iPad Pro, AirPods, and AirTags Rumors</h2><p>It's been a whirlwind of a month for Apple rumors. First, we heard from leaker Jon Prosser that an Apple Event was planned for March 16, but that was later ruled out by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. Once that date passed, Prosser and other leakers then suggested there would be an Apple Event on March 23, which is seemingly not happening either.</p><p><img alt=\"aipad pro tags slight tweak
