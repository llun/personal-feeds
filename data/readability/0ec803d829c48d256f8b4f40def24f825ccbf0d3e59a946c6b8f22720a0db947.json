While not the biggest contributing factor, one reason is that textile-based garments often result in a staggering number of off-cuts going to landfill. </p><p>Australian cycle clothing label MAAP has found a way to reduce its excess material waste by bundling it together. Named the OffCuts Program, MAAP will be producing limited runs of jerseys made from the excess fabric from previous production runs. </p><p>The program kicks off with a limited multi-colourway version of the Evade Pro Base jersey. MAAP plans to keep the program running as an ongoing part of <a href=\"https://maap.cc/stories/our-road-to-a-more-sustainable-future\" target=\"_blank\">its sustainability practices</a>. By next year the company aims to source 100% of its on-bike fabrics from Bluesign certified businesses and package all of its products in compostable bags.</p><p>MAAP is not the only cycle clothing brand aiming to be more environmentally responsible. In addition to a number of niche brands already doing so, the likes of Pearl Izumi, Rapha, OrNot, Santini, and more are pursuing eco-aware sustainability strategies. </p><p>How do you know what’s good and bad? Well, you can almost bet that if a brand is promoting an eco-friendly initiative then it’s at least better than doing nothing. Sadly there aren’t too many brands telling you to do the most eco-conscious thing possible – use what you already have.</p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0ec803d829c48d256f8b4f40def24f825ccbf0d3e59a946c6b8f22720a0db947","category":"Cycling"}
