Apple and Microsoft had a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/\">brief moment of contention</a> in August of last year as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> policy restricts services like xCloud from being available on the platform. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/11/apple-updates-app-store-review-guidelines/\">updated its policy</a> to allow xCloud onto the platform, but it would require Microsoft to submit each game available on the service individually to the ‌App Store‌, and each would have to be vetted against the platforms guidelines.</p><p>Microsoft blasted the rules as a \"bad experience for customers,\" and as a result, said it would push xCloud to iOS and iPadOS users via the browser on Safari. Screenshots provided to <em>The Verge</em> only show an xCloud experience via the browser on desktop, but the experience on iOS and iPadOS will likely be the same. Users will be able to select a game and play it directly within their browser; however, the exact resolution the game will be streamed at is as yet unknown. Typically, services like these will automatically adapt the resolution to meet your specific network capability.</p><p><img alt=\"xcloudweb 2 3\" width=\"2640\" height=\"1485\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/IV8FtWZIIuH-Xwgk-H2Ey6Dk8MQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/IV8FtWZIIuH-Xwgk-H2Ey6Dk8MQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/IV8FtWZIIuH-Xwgk-H2Ey6Dk8MQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Zzyuw8hGvceyUtbTtr6ldaI3xFw=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/yG_X_Zlwkw0-0-y1eUfu4vi14zc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/5gNOeHOD-Vj7Ob7-7OiBR_L2oCg=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/IV8FtWZIIuH-Xwgk-H2Ey6Dk8MQ=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Zzyuw8hGvceyUtbTtr6ldaI3xFw=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/yG_X_Zlwkw0-0-y1eUfu4vi14zc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/5gNOeHOD-Vj7Ob7-7OiBR_L2oCg=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg 2500w\"></p><p>At launch, xCloud will only support browsers built on Chromium like Edge and Chrome on the PC, but <em>The Verge</em>'s Senior Editor Tom Warren says that he expects support for Safari to be added following internal testing.
