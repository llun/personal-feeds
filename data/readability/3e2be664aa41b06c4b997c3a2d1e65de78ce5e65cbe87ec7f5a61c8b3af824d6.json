This regular and short-form tech coverage replaces our previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/tech-round-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tech Round-Up series</a>.</em> <em>Be sure to check out all the photos in the sliding gallery above.</em></p><hr><p>It was back in 2017 that I first got my hands on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/12/dynaplug-tubeless-tyre-repair-review-air-racer-carbonlite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dynaplug’s tubeless repair tools</a>. At the time I wanted to know whether they would plug a road tubeless tyre puncture as well as they do lower-pressure off-road rubber. Long story short, ever since then I’ve carried a Dynaplug tool with me on any ride where I’m rolling with tubeless tyres, and the original EpiPen-style <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/11/ten-products-i-loved-in-2018-david-rome/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Racer tool</a> remains a product I recommend to this day.&nbsp;</p><p>Since that review, Dynaplug has refined and evolved its product range that centres around the patented jab-and-go plug concept. You can now get “road-specific” versions with shorter insertion tubes, there’s the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/ct-tech-round-up-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Carbon Ultralight</a> which is a lower-cost and lighter version of the original Racer, and most recently, there’s the Racer Pro. At just over 10 cm in length the new Racer Pro may be marginally larger, but it’s also twice as useful. Let me explain.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the original Racer and the cheaper Racer Carbon keep two repair plugs at the ready: typically a regular size plug with a brass tip, and then the larger “mega plug” for bigger holes. This works wonderfully, at least until bad luck strikes twice and you find yourself needing more plugs. The new Racer Pro takes the number of stored plugs up to four by using double-ended and flippable insertion tubes.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the original Racer, the Racer Pro keeps the plugs ready to go behind machined aluminium caps. In the event you use the first plugs, then you simply unthread the insertion tubes (no tool required), flip them, and then thread them back into place. It’s that simple. At two grams and US$10 more than the original Racer, I don’t see why you wouldn’t go with this one.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course the tool still has the usual Dynaplug limitations. You can only use it with the American company’s own plugs, which aren’t that cheap. And being an American-made all-metal product means the tool itself isn’t particularly cheap.</p><p><strong>Price: </strong>U$55&nbsp;<br><strong>Weight:</strong> 26 grams<br><strong>More info:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dynaplug.com/racerpro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dynaplug.com</a></p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3e2be664aa41b06c4b997c3a2d1e65de78ce5e65cbe87ec7f5a61c8b3af824d6","category":"Cycling"}
