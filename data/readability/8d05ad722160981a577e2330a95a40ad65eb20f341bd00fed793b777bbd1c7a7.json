It</span><span>&nbsp;would, however, require rosters and budgets that surpass the limitations of most women’s teams.</span></p><p><span>But that’s fine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is the double-edged sword of women’s cycling — much of what makes it so brilliant is also, unfortunately, a product of it being chronically under-funded and undervalued.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/products/issue-101-womens-special\"><em><strong>Buy Rouleur's women's issue here</strong></em></a></p><p><span>While a dearth of racing opportunities and reduced rosters for the women are clearly not to be celebrated, an overlapping calendar is equally undesirable. Because here’s the thing: I don’t want to have to experience the FOMO inherent in trying to follow two stage races at once with women’s racing, too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Discussions within women’s cycling around how to grow the sport often warn against traversing the same path as the men’s </span><span>—&nbsp;</span><span>usually with good reason </span><span>—&nbsp;</span><span>and in this particular case, the men can keep their clashing calendar.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The reduced number of women’s races elevates the ones that actually go ahead. Even without a Coronavirus-ravaged early season, fewer women’s races means that the very best of the women’s peloton show up to lower level races such as the 1.2 GP Oetingen last Sunday, where Marianne Vos took third.</span></p><p><span>Forgetting even the fan perspective, the fact that the sport’s financial model relies on sponsor exposure through televised footage is something that women’s teams know all too well. The fight to see more live images of women’s races has been going on for years. Why then, as either a sponsor or a fan, would you ever want to have the TV coverage of one race cannibalising the other?</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Alex_Whitehead2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616067158\" alt=\"\"></p><p><em><span>Photo credit: Alex Whitehead/<span>SWPix.com</span></span></em></p><p><span>The world of women’s cycling is small and the protagonists are easy to follow and relate to.
