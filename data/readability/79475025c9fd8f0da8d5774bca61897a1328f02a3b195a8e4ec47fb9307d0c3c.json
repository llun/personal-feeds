A group of just five, including Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Fenix) and Jhonatan Narvaez (Ineos Grenadiers), nearly survived to the finish, but a long, straight crosswind section with 2km to go ended their day off the front.</p><p>The front group came together just ahead of the red kite, around 1.6 kilometers to go. A sweeping left hand corner put the wind at the rider’s back right, and Pedersen followed the wheel of teammate Jasper Stuyven up the protected left side. He timed his launch to perfection, taking the win by a bike length.</p><p>Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie) and a flying Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) crossed the line in second and third.</p><p><em>More to come.</em></p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"79475025c9fd8f0da8d5774bca61897a1328f02a3b195a8e4ec47fb9307d0c3c","category":"Cycling"}
