If you are planning on bringing your dog along for an off-leash romp beside your mountain bike, there are a few important caveats:</p><ol><li>Make sure you’re allowed to have your dog off-leash in the area you’re planning to ride. Many places don’t allow off-leash dogs—be respectful of those rules.</li><li>Your dog should be able to easily follow voice commands and always respond when you call him or her. Whether you’re using the dogjoring-style leash we recommend or going off-leash, start slow. Train your dog to run with you on the bike somewhere where there aren’t people, other dogs, or distractions, like a big open field. Eventually add stimulus, like another mountain bike or even another (already trained) trail dog, and make sure you both feel completely comfortable before hitting the trails.</li><li>You might love dogs, but remember that not everyone does. Be aware of other humans on the trail and don’t assume people are as happy to see your dog as you are. You should be ready to leash your dog at a moment’s notice.</li><li>Be patient. Your dog might not be up for a 90-minute ride on its first jaunt, or you may find that you need to stop while he sniffs around or rolls in creeks.</li><li>Be realistic. Some dogs simply aren’t going to want to ride in your handlebar basket or bike backpack, or chase you on trails. And some dogs—like breeds with flattened noses—aren’t good at running long distances, so being out on the trails may be dangerous for them.</li><li>Mature dogs only, please. Both in behavior (they shouldn’t bolt at every squirrel) and age. Dogs should be at least a year old before hitting the trails with you. Puppies are still developing and letting them sprint after you on the bike can be dangerous to their development.</li><li>Pay attention to your dog’s needs while you ride. Remember, they get hot easily, so make sure when you’re stopping to take a drink, you’re pouring some water for your pup as well. Or on them. Which means you need to bring extra water.</li><li>And keep an eye on their paws. If you’re worried about your tires puncturing on sharp rocks, your pup’s paws are also at risk.</li><li>Clean up after your dog. Always.</li></ol><p>Now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk gear!

Kurgo</figcaption></figure><p>Swap your dog’s collar for a harness when going on any speedy adventures. Harnesses are easier on your dog’s neck and make controlling them safer.

Kate Ditullio</figcaption></figure><p>Dogjoring is where a dog pulls a sled, and bikejoring is the new skijoring. Longtime rider and runner Kate Ditullio’s vizsla Blitz is a speedy dog on and off the leash. In parks where leashes are required or for jaunts around town, she likes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nonstopdogwear.com/en-int/product/biking-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nonstop Dogwear’s Biking Kit</a>, which combines a Freemotion harness, bungee leash, and an antenna that connects it all to the bike.</p><p>Blitz is able to set the pace rather than get dragged alongside the bike thanks to an antenna that goes off the front of the bike rather than the side. The Freemotion harness is loose so it moves with the dog rather than stifling him. And a bungee cord leash provides more freedom without creating a tripping hazard.</p><p>Ditullio’s primary piece of advice: Make sure that your dog understands trail cues and is comfortable in the harness before ripping on singletrack. Blitz understands Left, Right, and Stop. Practice riding together in a field before heading onto the trails. Dogjoring won’t be for every dog, but if you want to bring your pup on your ride <em>and</em> keep him close, this kit is the best way to do so.</p><ul><li>Type: Trail dogs</li><li>Size: 9 harness sizes, for 10.2 to 25.2-inch circumference dog necks</li><li>Price: $200</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Keeps dog safely attached to you<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Not every dog will be suited for dogjoring, requires training and patience, expensive</p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST FOR OFF-LEASH TRAIL DOGS</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQD98QF/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SceneReal Large Collar Bell</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><figure id=\"attachment_262543\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-262543\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear.jpg\" alt=\"collar bell best trail dog gear\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1215\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-297x226.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-800x608.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-120x91.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-768x583.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-1536x1166.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-696x529.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-1068x811.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-553x420.jpg 553w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-80x60.jpg 80w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-297x226.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-800x608.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-120x91.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-768x583.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-1536x1166.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-696x529.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-1068x811.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-553x420.jpg 553w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22153053/collar-bell-best-trail-dog-gear-80x60.jpg 80w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-262543\">Photo c.

First, it allows you to know when he’s getting farther away, as the bell gets quieter and quieter. Second, it warns other riders and trail users that a dog is coming up behind them. And third, if you have a big dog who can occasionally get confused for a bear or wolf, the bell lets people know that he’s harmless.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQD98QF/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SceneReal Large Collar Bell</a> clips onto a dog’s harness or collar and merrily jangles as your pup romps through the woods. It also gives smaller forest animals a heads up that something bigger is coming.

Avery Stumm</figcaption></figure><p>Pro racer Alexey Vermeulen wasn’t about to let his mini-dachshund’s short legs keep Willie from becoming the ultimate riding buddy. Rather than bringing him along on the trails, Vermeulen pedals for hundreds of miles with Willie comfortably nestled (and relatively aerodynamic) on his back.</p><p>This is a great option for road bikers and bikepackers who prefer to skip the basket on the front of their bike, and ideal for small dogs. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0974QW4P8/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">K9 Sport Sack Air 2</a> comes in sizes from extra small to large and can hold dogs up to 30 pounds in size. (There are burlier options if you relish the idea of riding with your golden retriever on your back, though we wouldn’t recommend it.) Practice on small rides, as a heavier load can throw your balance off.</p><p>The K9 Sport Sack Air 2 keeps even the wiggliest of pups in place and locked in when there are other animals in sight or bumps on the road. Vermeulen says Willie loves their rides together. They also bring the K9 Sport Snuggler—a winter coat for backpack pups—when they ride into the mountains in the event of inclement weather.

We like the Burley Tail Wagon for its thoughtful design, lightweight towing, and ability to hold up to 75 pounds of pup.

It has plenty of space for your dog to lie down, or to sit up with his head out to see what’s happening. It has mesh on all four sides for airflow to keep your dog cool, and a flip-down tailgate so elderly dogs don’t need to jump to get in and out. You can also purchase the stroller kit to convert it for walking or jogging.</p><p>It’s covered by a one-year warranty for fabric and a three-year warranty for all other parts.

And honestly, all of the gear in here can double for human use as well, so it’s a good thing to keep with you on every ride.</p><p>Bonus: If you have a bigger dog and want him to carry his gear, this clips onto Kurgo harnesses!</p><ul><li>Type: All dogs</li><li>Size: One size fits all</li><li>Price: $33</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Easy to carry, good for emergencies<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Contains mostly first aid gear you probably already have at home</p><h2>Trail Dog Gear Buyer’s Guide</h2><p><strong>Know your dog</strong>. Ask yourself how you want to ride with your dog, and what kind of playing your pup loves to do. If you have a very chill dog, he may not be an ideal candidate for a trail dog, but maybe he’d love to come along in a basket, backpack or chariot.</p><p><strong>Think about your riding style.</strong> If you love spending all day on the trails, your dog might not be up for hours of running. But if you love quick spins in the forest, that might work perfectly. (Don’t forget to check leash laws!)</p><p><strong>Think about your dog’s weight.</strong> Whether you’re pulling him in a chariot or being pulled in a dogjoring setup, make sure that you can handle his weight. Also check that the gear is rated for dogs of his size!</p><p><strong>Measure twice</strong>. Use a soft tape measure to get accurate chest and neck sizes. Measure twice, buy once. And remember, just because your dog’s breed is listed as “size small usually fits XYZ breed,” it’s worth double checking. You may have a dog with a large chest for his breed. Weight also matters for things like bike baskets and chariots, so step on the scale with your dog and get an accurate reading.</p><p><strong>Test before you ride</strong>. All of these pieces of gear can be tested in a field or parking lot without a bike in the mix. It’s worth spending a few practice sessions making sure the equipment fits your pup comfortably and they can follow orders before adding the bike.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Bike Gear for Dogs</h2><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ub697GgOE8M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span></p><p><strong>Can any dog be a trail dog?</strong><br>Sure, some breeds are obviously better for running with your bike. Vizslas, German Short-Haired Pointers, Australian Shepards, and Border Collies are obvious choices, but sometimes, the tiny dogs can surprise you. Case in point, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPdiW39B19U\">this tiny 8-pound Havanese just sending it</a>. And check the video above to see more four-legged shredders in action.</p><p>Smaller dogs might not be able to go for long distances or fast rides, but they might enjoy short jaunts or more field-based family bike outings. (This editor’s mini-dachshund enjoys laps of a local dirt pump track.)</p><p><strong>Any tips for getting a dog used to the trails?</strong><br>Starting with a specific short loop of a local trail is a good way to get started. This way, you’re never far from your car in case your dog tires quickly. A trail that you know well makes for smoother navigation. And dogs are surprisingly good with learning loops, so you may find it’s easier for your pup to keep up.</p><p><strong>What should I bring?</strong><br>In addition to the gear itself, always have treats and extra water on hand. It’s also a good idea to carry a small pet first aid kit in your pack in case of emergencies. And of course, always have poo bags.</p><p>Keep an eye on the weather as well. If your dog is sitting in a carrier, he’ll get chilled from cold or wet weather more easily, so you may want to bring a jacket.</p><figure id=\"attachment_262538\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-262538\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear.jpeg\" alt=\"k9 sport sack alexy vermeulen 3 best trail dog gear\" width=\"1067\" height=\"1600\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear.jpeg 1067w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-200x300.jpeg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-800x1200.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-80x120.jpeg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-768x1152.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-696x1044.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-280x420.jpeg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1067px) 100vw, 1067px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear.jpeg 1067w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-200x300.jpeg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-800x1200.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-80x120.jpeg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-768x1152.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-1024x1536.jpeg 1024w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-696x1044.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22152116/k9-sport-sack-alexy-vermeulen-3-best-trail-dog-gear-280x420.jpeg 280w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-262538\">Always bring a jacket if conditions are wet or chilly – Photo c.

Even before putting your dog in the chariot and going for a short ride, bring the chariot inside and set it up as a comfy spot for your dog to explore. The same goes for baskets and bags. Then, gradually introduce movement by walking with the basket, bag, or chariot. Finally, hook it up to the bike for short durations. And make sure your dog gets plenty of treats or praise in the process!</p><p>Got your own tips for cycling with dogs?
