Now comes word that Sonos is teeing up a new device for next month, and there are strong hints that it could be a smaller, more movable Move.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During Sonos’ earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Patrick Spence announced that the company’s “newest product” would arrive in March, <a href=\"https://www.the-ambient.com/news/new-sonos-speaker-landing-next-month-ceo-spills-the-beans-2536\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to The Ambient</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Spence didn’t go into any further detail about the upcoming device, a recent Sonos FCC filing suggests that the product could be a new—and likely smaller—portable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi speaker.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">As The Verge notes</a>, the FCC filing describes a new speaker that supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 5, along with a wireless charging dock. The filing also says that the upcoming speaker consumes less power than the two-year-old Move, which suggests a smaller (and hopefully lighter) shell.</p><div><p><img onclick=\"jwplayer('bottomRightPlayer').remove(); this.style.display = 'none';\" id=\"jw-standalone-close-button\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"></p></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the Move’s daunting size and heft—it’s fitted with a handle, and feels as heavy as a bowling ball—we still <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3439397/sonos-move-review.html\">lavished it with praise in our review</a>, calling it a “remarkable” portable speaker with “fantastic” audio quality, “amazing” Wi-Fi range and “long” battery life. The Move is tough, too, with its IP56-certified shell designed to resist dust and jets of water.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, there’s <em>another</em> possibility for Sonos’ next product, and it’s an enticing one: a pair of headphones.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sonos fans have long wondered whether the company would unveil wireless headphones, and there’s evidence that Sonos has at least mulled the idea. Last summer, Sonos was awarded a patent for a pair of over-ear headphones with noise cancellation, touch controls, a line-level input, and a “possible” USB-C charging report, <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/sonos-headphones-patent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Protocol reports</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Interesting stuff, but how often have we seen patents for products that never come to fruition? An FCC filing, on the other hand, points to a device that’s close to fully baked, and that’s why our money is on a smaller Move rather than the headphones (for now, anyway).
