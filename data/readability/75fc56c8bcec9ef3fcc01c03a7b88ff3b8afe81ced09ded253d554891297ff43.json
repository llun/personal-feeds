Kang says that Apple's event will be held on the same date as the OnePlus 9 reveal, which is scheduled for Tuesday, March 23.</p><p>Due to the global health crisis, Apple's event is expected to be held digitally and live-streamed via its website and official YouTube channel. March 23 and March 30 are both reasonable guesses for when Apple is set to hold an event. Apple tends to hold events on Tuesday and is also expected to hold an event in the \"early spring\" to coincide with the launch of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5.</p><p>Official details about Apple's event remain unknown.
