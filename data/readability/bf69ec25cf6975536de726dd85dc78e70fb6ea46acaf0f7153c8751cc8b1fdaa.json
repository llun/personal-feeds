Thus, there exists a demand for efficient usage of space within an electronic device, and efficient means of cooling the device.

When in a deployed position, the Mac's processor may be permitted to get hotter to deliver better performance, due to the increased airflow. In Macs that do feature a fan as well as deployable feet, the fan's speed would be \"at least partially\" determined based on the extent of the deployment.</p><blockquote><p>The electronic device can include a sensor that detects at least one of a temperature or a processing speed of the electronic device, and provides the signal in response to the detection. The electronic device can further include a fan, wherein a speed of the fan is at least partially based on a state of the deployable feature.</p></blockquote><p>The filing also addresses the potential waste of space within a MacBook that deployable feet could cause.
