Hemmerstoffer previously nailed the design of the Pixel 4a all the way back in January 2020, so it's smart to take his Pixel 5a info seriously.</p><p>There really isn't much to see in the renders since the Pixel 5a looks identical to previous Pixel devices like the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5, and it isn't that much different from the Pixel 4a. In this case, Google isn't fixing what isn't broken. The design looks perfectly modern with slim bezels and a hole-punch camera, and there's really no need to demand change for change's sake.</p><p>Like a few other midrange phones, the Pixel 5a offers some design decisions you might actually prefer to a flagship smartphone. There's a flat-screen without any curved sides, a headphone jack, and a rear capacitive fingerprint reader.&nbsp;Hemmerstoffer says the phone has a plastic back, stereo speakers, and a 6.2-inch display, which is a size increase over the 5.8-inch Pixel 4a.</p><p>The back has an unknown extra camera, but if Google follows the lead of the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5, the camera will have a wide-angle lens. After using the same camera sensor on the Pixel 2, 3, 4, and 5, will the 5a be the first time in four years Google upgrades its camera hardware? That might be too much to ask from a midrange phone.</p><p>We're still missing the other important details, like the specs and a price. The Pixel 3a was $400 and the Pixel 4a was $350, making both of them hard to argue with when you were getting great performance for so little.</p><p>It's anyone's guess as to when the Pixel 5a will come out. The Pixel 4a was first leaked eight months before it launched in August, but a lot of that time was probably due to delays from COVID-19. The Pixel 3a launched in the middle of the year, at Google I/O 2019, but there's a good chance there won't even be a Google I/O this year.</p><p><em>Listing image by <a href=\"https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-google-pixel-5a-1614036211-183558310\">Steve Hemmerstoffer</a></em></p></div></div>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be7ecb5e3f6964828eb97d91905620aba7d52519101ce2e53db84eac38adc8a9","category":"Tech"}
