The early break was caught inside the last 30 kilometers to set up the fast finish.</p><p>Deceuninck-Quick-Step, Bora-Hansgrohe, Qhubelka-Assos, and DSM positioned themselves at or near the front in the closing kilometers, with Bora-Hansgrohe leading into the winding final few hundred meters. <strong>Pascal Ackermann</strong>&nbsp;led the way with&nbsp;a hundred meters to go but several sprinters surged past in the closing meters with&nbsp;Bennett powering to the front and sailing&nbsp;over the line for the win. <strong>David Dekker</strong> nabbed second with <strong>Caleb Ewan</strong> in for third.</p><p><strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> retained his overall lead with three stages to go.</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9dxMK7rRZU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><h3>Giro d’Italia route unveiled</h3><p>Organizers have <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/challenging-climbs-two-time-trials-and-gravel-2021-giro-route-announced/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveiled the route</a> of the 2021 <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong>, with the race set to feature some very challenging climbs along with a pair of time trials and a bit of gravel.</p><p>Individual time trials will bookend the race but with only 38.4 km of time trialing in total, it looks like a good race for the climbers, who will have their work cut out for them. The other major challenges will include a challenging stage 11 with 35 km of gravel roads on tap, a finish atop the <strong>Monte Zoncolan</strong> on stage 14, a grueling day in the Dolomites on stage 16, and stage 20, which features two climbs to over 2,000 meters before a summit finish.</p><h3>Paris-Roubaix announces team selection</h3><p><strong>Paris-Roubaix</strong> organizers <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/cyclocross-stars-alvarado-and-cant-invited-to-paris-roubaix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced the teams selected</a> for the women’s and men’s races this year on Wednesday, and among the key highlights from the announcement was the invitation of <strong>Ciclismo Mundial</strong>, the team of cyclocross stars like <strong>Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado</strong> and <strong>Sanne Cant</strong>, to make the start.</p><p>The women’s race will see all nine WorldTour teams joined by Ciclismo Mundial as well as A.R.

Instead of the proposed design, Bennett will wear a mostly white jersey with a black fern.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/george-bennetts-national-champions-jersey-shut-down-by-cycling-new-zealand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cyclingnews</a> reports that Cycling New Zealand addressed the topic in a statement.</p><p>“We have National Champions across all of our disciplines and events who wear the same shirt with the same registered design,” Cycling New Zealand CEO Jacques Landry said, according to Cyclingnews. “It is simply not possible nor is it the correct process to make such a fundamental change to the jersey design two months into the year on the request of one national champion.”</p><h2>Coming up …</h2><p>Thursday sees the UAE Tour continue with a big day for GC contenders like the aforementioned Pogacar and last year’s winner Adam Yates, who currently sits second overall. The peloton will set out from the Fujairah Marine Club and travel 170 kilometers to Jebel Jais, the highest climb in the United Arab Emirates.</p><h2>In case you missed it…</h2><ul><li>As Ronan Mc Laughlin writes, <strong>Favero</strong> could be about to launch an <strong>Assioma</strong> power meter <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/leaked-favero-assioma-shimano-compatible-power-meter-pedal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">compatible with Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies</a>.</li><li>Dave Rome <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/scribe-aero-wide-42-disc-brake-road-wheelset-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reviews</a> <strong>Scribe’s Aero Wide+ 42</strong> disc brake wheels.</li><li><strong>Volkswagen</strong> has just launched <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/volkswagon-is-now-leasing-bikes-in-germany-is-this-just-the-beginning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bicycle leasing and financing options</a> in Germany.</li><li>This week’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/win-it-weekly-3t-exploro-pro-team/\">Win It Weekly</a> prize is a <strong>3T Exploro TEAM</strong> frame.</li></ul><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"5b91c4e6e9cef4c452cff7adfc7458036e0c1395ad7ed8bc11c6a4d1e4349ff9","category":"Cycling"}
