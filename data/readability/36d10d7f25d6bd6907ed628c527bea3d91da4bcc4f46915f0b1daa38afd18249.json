The proposed class action therefore seeks $5,000 in damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws, amounting to at least $5 billion.</p><p>Google attempted to have the case thrown out by arguing that the plaintiffs consented to its privacy policy, which the company said explicitly discloses its data protection practices.</p><p>\"Google also makes clear that 'Incognito' does not mean 'invisible,' and that the user's activity during that session may be visible to websites they visit, and any third-party analytics or ads services the visited websites use,\" Google said in a court filing.</p><p>However, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the company \"did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode.\"</p><p>Google has said it will defend itself \"vigorously\" against the claims.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">iPhone 13 Models Will 'Likely' Have Touch ID Under the Display</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models slated for release later this year will \"likely\" feature a fingerprint scanner embedded under the display for authentication, in addition to Face ID, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner and three of his colleagues.
