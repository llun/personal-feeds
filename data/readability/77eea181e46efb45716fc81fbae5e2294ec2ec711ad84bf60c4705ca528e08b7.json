Then there’s low pressure, high volume pumps for mountain and fat bikes. That leaves room for pumps for gravel bikes, right? Well, not&nbsp;<em>just</em> gravel. Lezyne’s new floor pumps are built to make inflating gravel tires easier, while still able to hit the high notes for your road bikes. They also get an interesting tubeless-specific chuck for better tubeless setups.</p><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CfCb4conCu4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" ezoid=\"0.0767140975499736\"></iframe></span></p><p>Gravel tires have higher volume than road tires, but not quite the volume of modern mountain bike tires. They’re also typically run at lower pressures – sometimes much lower than road. So Lezyne wanted to create a line of pumps that were better suited to these mid-volume tires without limiting the ability to pump road bike tires up to 100 psi.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck.jpg\" alt=\"Lezyne Gravel Floor Pumps tubeless chuck\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1232\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-297x244.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-800x657.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-120x99.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-768x631.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-696x572.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-1068x877.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-511x420.jpg 511w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-297x244.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-800x657.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-120x99.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-768x631.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-696x572.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-1068x877.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17105016/Lezyne-Gravel-floor-pumps-mid-volume-high-pressure-chuck-511x420.jpg 511w\"></a></p><p>Perhaps more interesting than the idea of a gravel-specific pump is the inclusion of a “tubelss-specific chuck.” What makes it tubeless specific? Well, since it works with standard presta valve cores, you’ll still be able to inflate tires running a tube. But the chuck is designed so that you can remove the valve core, and the chuck will thread onto a threaded presta shaft giving you better airflow to seat tubeless tires.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-medrectangle-3\"></span></p><p>This is where the higher volume of the “gravel” pump comes into play. With the valve core removed, the pump pushes more volume of air per stroke, giving you a better chance of seating stubborn mid-volume tubeless tires.</p><p><a
