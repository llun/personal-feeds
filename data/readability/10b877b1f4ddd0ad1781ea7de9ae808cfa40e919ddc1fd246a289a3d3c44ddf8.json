We will fight to be even better on the next races coming up.'</p><p>However,&nbsp;Roglič also admitted that the extent of his injuries was a little worse than he'd expected, saying, 'I'm still recovering, it will maybe take some days more than I thought it would. But I crashed twice and now I really need to heal up.</p><p>'I will do the Tour of the Basque Country in three weeks, then a few one day races in the Ardennes, then of course the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> later in the year.'</p><p>Roglič&nbsp;does, of course, have his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/li-ge-bastogne-li-ge\">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a> title to defend, which he won just weeks after losing the Tour de France also right at the finish. Although it's safe to say Julian Alaphilippe won't be celebrating too early this time.</p><p>The Tour is still clearly Roglic's top priority though. 'I will do everything for that win. I'm working for that and the guys around me know that if we give everything then the best guy will win,' he said.</p></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"10b877b1f4ddd0ad1781ea7de9ae808cfa40e919ddc1fd246a289a3d3c44ddf8","category":"Cycling"}
