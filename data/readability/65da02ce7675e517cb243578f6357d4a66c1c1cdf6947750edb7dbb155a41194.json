It has been great seeing him transform his dream into a global media brand. I am a big fan of what he and his talented team have created; so it is a great pleasure to be invited to help them on this journey ”</p><p>Wade Wallace said, “CyclingTips has found itself in a position where our organic readership in the UK and Europe is growing at an extremely rapid rate. It would be a missed opportunity if we didn’t service these readers with more relevant content, and provide the local industry with ways to reach this highly engaged community. I first met Bruce many years ago, in awe of what he was doing with Rouleur. Now I’m thrilled and honoured to be working with him and bringing his experience and knowledge to CyclingTips.”</p><p>CyclingTips’ global reach and influence are supported by a global staff, including editorial staff in England, Ireland, the United States, Australia, France, Netherlands, and Spain, as well as sales staff in the UK, US, New Zealand and Australia.
