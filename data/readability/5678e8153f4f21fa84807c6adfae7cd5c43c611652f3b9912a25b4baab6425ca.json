The only other scary moment was on the final section which was by far the steepest.

I’m used to climbing and typically something like this with that amount of camera kit you’d probably use ropes to get up. Once we overcame getting up that’s when I had the realization that Danny had to ride down that face and we’d have to watch –&nbsp;definitely nerve-wracking.&nbsp;Myself and Duncan couldn’t watch the final run down.</span></em></p><p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">What was the biggest challenge from your perspective being a director?</span></strong></p><p><em><span lang=\"EN-US\">Robbie: The biggest challenge of this project other than Danny’s riding was probably deciding on the song. With the drone angles we wanted to use we were forced into having longer takes to do the riding justice and needed a song with the right timing to allow these to fit. On the slabs themselves everything ran fairly smooth.</span></em></p><p><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat.jpg\" alt=\"danny macaskill we are peny team the slabs\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/danny-macaskill-the-salbs-behind-the-scenes-team-travel-by-boat-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">What is the difference in shooting a project entirely with GoPro and how do you approach that?&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Robbie:&nbsp;</span>It’s really fun working on projects filmed 100% with GoPro.<span lang=\"EN-US\">. It gives you a chance to shoot something in a different way and get creative with angles. You don’t have the option of swapping out the focal lengths to bring the viewer closer to the riding so you have to find ways to move the camera with the action and get it in the right position to capture those non POV angles.
