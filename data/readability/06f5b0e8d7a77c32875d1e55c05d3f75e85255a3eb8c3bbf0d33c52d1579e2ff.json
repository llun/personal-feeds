Cavagna, however, was 17 seconds faster at the intermediate time check, and he rode well enough in the latter part of the course to set a final mark six seconds faster than Bissegger’s.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CORVOS_00033088-005-1340x894.jpeg\"><figcaption>Cavagna on his way to winning the final stage.</figcaption></figure><p>Thomas was the penultimate rider down the ramp and set off in the hope of unseating overnight leader <strong>Mike Woods (EF Education-Nippo)</strong>, who had taken the GC lead after Thomas crashed in the finale of stage 4.</p><p>That crash did not seem to affect Thomas on Sunday, as he cruised through the course in a time of 22:11 to finish third on the stage behind Cavagna and Bissegger. Woods set a mark of 23:05, only good enough for 28th on the day, dropping down off the GC podium.</p><p>Thomas took the overall victory with a 28-second gap to his Ineos Grenadiers teammate <strong>Richie Porte</strong>, who claimed runner-up honors while <strong>Fausto Masnada</strong><strong>(Deceuninck-QuickStep)</strong> rounded out the overall podium.

I came into this going good and wanting to win it but there are 200 dudes in the race and it’s 270 kilometres. What are the chances?”</p><p><strong>Matilda Raynolds (Specialized Women’s Racing)</strong> was triumphant in defending her title in the women’s event, finishing ahead of <strong>Justine Barrow (Roxsolt Liv SRAM)</strong> and <strong>Nicole Frain (Sydney Uni Staminade)</strong>.</p><p><em>You can see the full results <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/plowright-wins-the-2021-melbourne-to-warrnambool/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p><h3>Tom Pidcock wins his first MTB race back</h3><p>British multi-discipline superstar <strong>Tom Pidcock (Ineos-Grenadiers)</strong> has wasted no time finding his groove as he transitions back to MTB ahead of the Olympics.</p><p>Just 10 days after finishing sixth at Flèche Wallonne, the 21-year-old took a commanding win at the one-day <strong>Swiss Bike Cup</strong> race in Leukerbad. Pidcock attacked on the second of seven laps and quickly build an unassailable lead. He went on to finish more than three minutes ahead of runner-up <strong>Titouan Carod (Absolute-Absalon-BMC).</strong></p><h3>Deceuninck-QuickStep plays down Remco Evenepoel’s Giro chances</h3><p><strong>Remco Evenepoel (Deceuninck-QuickStep)</strong> will start this year’s Giro d’Italia as one of the favourites, despite the fact he hasn’t raced in eight months andeven though it will be his first Grand Tour. But as the start of the Giro approaches, Evenepoel’s team is doing what it can to reduce the hype surrounding its 21-year-old super-talent, with sports director Klaas Lodewyck telling <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/events/giro-ditalia/remco-evenepoel-at-the-giro-ditalia-we-hope-he-is-able-to-finish/\" target=\"_blank\">VeloNews</a> that just finishing the Giro is Evenepoel’s main goal.</p><p>“It will be very stupid to ask him to immediately be the leader of the team and screw him already in the first week,” Lodewyck said. “He just has to learn, it’s going to be his first Grand Tour. We just want to keep him quiet and see day by day how he feels.”</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Joao Almedia will ostensibly lead the team’s GC tilt, but depending on how Evenepoel goes, he could seemingly step into that role too.</p><p>“He’s going to have a free role,” Lodewyck said of Evenepoel. “If we see after maybe 10 days that he’s growing into the race, and if he’s strong like we saw last year with Ineos and Tao Geoghegan Hart, he definitely could have that role as well. So we just have to keep him quiet and easy and see day by day.”</p><h3>Kasper Asgreen renews contract with Deceuninck-QuickStep</h3><p>Speaking of Deceuninck-QuickStep, another one of its stars, <strong>Kasper Asgreen</strong>, has just inked a contract extension with the Belgian squad.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-rvv-men-78-1340x894.jpg\"><figcaption>Asgreen winning the Tour of Flanders last month.</figcaption></figure><p>Asgreen, who won both the E3 Saxo Bank Classic and the Tour of Flanders this spring, has signed on with the team through to the end of 2024.</p><p>“Staying here was a no-brainer for me,” Asgreen said via a team press release. “Deceuninck-QuickStep is the most successful team in the world, and ever since I was an amateur, I dreamed of joining them, as I loved how they always developed young riders into winners. Three years on, I still believe it’s the best environment for me and signing an extension so early into the season makes me happy and motivates me even more to perform.”</p><h2>In case you missed it …</h2><ul><li><strong>Pedro</strong>‘s has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/pedros-new-tools-for-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">updated</a> its hex keys, chain keepers, mechanic’s tools, and more.</li><li>The newest episode of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/nerd-alert-podcast-high-fashion-meets-high-tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Nerd Alert podcast</a> takes a closer look at the science of <strong>cycling clothing</strong>.</li><li>Get the <strong>latest</strong> from the world of women’s cycling in the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/womens-cycling-weekly-issue-23/\" target=\"_blank\">Women’s Cycling Weekly</a>.</li><li>Iain Treloar <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/sks-bluemels-reflective-mudguards-review/\" target=\"_blank\">reviews</a> the <strong>SKS Bluemels</strong> reflective mudguards.</li></ul></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"06f5b0e8d7a77c32875d1e55c05d3f75e85255a3eb8c3bbf0d33c52d1579e2ff","category":"Cycling"}
