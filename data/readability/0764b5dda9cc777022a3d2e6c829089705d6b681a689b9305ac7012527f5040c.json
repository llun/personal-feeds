Thank you to our readers who sent in the following questions. If you’ve any follow up questions for the guys at WTB, pop them in the comments below. Happy reading!</p><p><strong>I’ve recently switched out the Judge single-ply casing on the rear for a dual-ply tough one as that’s what I could get my hands on. I’ve kept the pressure the same (1.65 Bar). The rear end now feels much harsher than it did previously which I guess shouldn’t surprise me with the stiffer side walls. Do I need to adjust the tire pressure, or the pressure in the rear shock maybe? I ride dusty rocky trails, just wondering what I can get away with before puncturing.</strong></p><p><strong>WTB:</strong> As a general rule, a single ply casing will be more supple and compliant than the dual-ply version of the same tire, so it’s quite normal to notice these differences at the exact same pressure.</p><figure id=\"attachment_196744\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-196744\"><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05.jpg\" alt=\"2019 WTB Judge rear mountain bike tire for downhill and enduro gravity riding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wtb-judge-enduro-downhill-mountain-bike-tires05-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-196744\">The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/07/11/eb18-wtb-gets-rowdy-with-new-wider-mountain-bike-tires-improves-tubeless-rims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WTB Judge</a> is a rear-specific tire with well-spaced knobs that bite soft terrain remarkably well</figcaption></figure><p>You should be able to find a very similar ‘ride feel’ if you drop your tire pressure a little, but it’s very difficult to put a number on it as there are so many variables.</p><p>My advice would be to drop the tire pressure in very small increments until you arrive at a setting that feels more familiar and comfortable.

For example, the oil in your suspension will be ‘thicker’ when it’s really cold so that would probably be more noticeable when riding than the small changes in tire pressures.</p><p><strong>Do even tyre pressures make sense on mountain bikes? A friend of a friend who is a&nbsp;frame builder uses a telemetry system to try and unpick suspension tunes, geometry choices and more when building bikes. They also happen to swear by running the same tyre pressure front and rear, stating it gives a calmer ride. I’ve recently been trying it and noticed the same sensation when running equal pressures and casings front and rear! (Tough-High Grip) Is there any reason this seems to work? Or are we missing something?</strong></p><p><strong>WTB: </strong>I think the main reason that people choose to run a little more pressure in the rear is to give a little more support and protection against punctures. It’s easier to unweight the front wheel than it is the rear wheel when riding down a trail, especially at short notice. So, this means that the rear tire is often left hanging and ends up taking more hits. A little more pressure will lower the pinch risk.</p><figure id=\"attachment_253853\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253853\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales.jpg\" alt=\"climbing steep terrain weights rear wheel requiring higher tire pressure\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26124307/climbing-rocky-path-brecon-beacons-wales-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-253853\">Credit: Andy Lloyder.</figcaption></figure><p>You don’t just put more force through the rear tire when you’re descending though.

If you are riding in particularly rough terrain with lots of sharp and aggressive edges, then it’s good to protect yourself against this by making it harder to bottom out on the rim in the first place.</p><figure id=\"attachment_253845\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-253845\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure.jpg\" alt=\"WTB RIDDLER GRAVEL TIRE SG2 NYLON INSERT PUNCTURE PROTECTION\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26121013/22-07-20-WTB-Riddler-SG2-Protection-more-tire-pressure-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-253845\">Credit: Sam Oldsmith</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Should I be using inserts for cyclocross or gravel?

These effects are amplified on narrower tires due to the forces of the inserts on the casing.</p><p>By fitting an insert, you also reduce sealant flow within the tire which means you are reducing the sealant’s ability to do its job and seal any punctures if they occur.</p><p><strong>BONUS RANDOM: How long do WTB plan on continuing production of 26” tyres for?</strong></p><p><strong>WTB: </strong>This depends on market demand.
