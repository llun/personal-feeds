Maybe you use an app for training indoors. Or maybe you just can’t relax unless your phone is in sight.</p><p>For us, easy access to the phone’s camera, jotting down notes on products we’re testing, or simply checking Slack during a mid-ride snack break is part of the job.</p><p>While we might recommend stashing your phone in a pack or handlebar bag and taking a digital break while you’re out riding, sometimes you simply need phone access during your ride and that’s okay (in fact, check out the FAQ section below to see how a phone mount may save the day).

Bikerumor staffers try phone mounts regularly, and many come back to QuadLock and keep mounts on all of their bikes (<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/11/05/review-quad-lock-iphone-x-case-out-front-bike-mount-keeps-smartphone-camera-ready/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read our full review here</a>).</p><p>The QuadLock system includes a case your choice of two out-front handlebar mounts, or a strap-on stem mount. Your phone connects in the same way that cycling computers attach to their mount – pop it on and twist it to lock.</p><p>Quick, easy camera access and rock-solid security is the highlight of the QuadLock case. The mount locks the phone into it, yet it’s easy to detach it quickly. The cases are slim but protective, and the mounts are sleek enough that they won’t look out of place on rides without your phone on it.</p><p>While this case/mount combo is pricier than others up front, additional mounts are relatively inexpensive. You’re committing to a system, but QuadLock has been around since 2011 and keeps up with new phone technology, so you can rest assured that your new phone will have a QuadLock case that works with it. And they make mounts for everything: Dash, moto, suction cup, tripod, armband, stick-on, desktop, and more. There’s even a clear silicone “poncho” cover to protect it from inclement weather, and a stick-on mount you can use on other cases if you just want the mounts.</p><ul><li>Attachment style: Locks onto handlebars</li><li>Case required?

It can be used with all but the bulkiest case (<em>no mount will work properly if you use a phone wallet and pack it full of cards, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">George</a></em>).</p><p>The nice part about Delta Cycles’ X-Mount Pro mount is that it’s multipurpose.

Bike mounts are category where Amazon reviews are king, and the Lamicall clamp has generated 8100+ positive reviews. Even mountain bikers on gnarly singletrack reported that it stayed stable on their rides.</p><p>Because of its adjustable sides—plastic coated with silicone for added grip—it fits all phones from 4.7 to 6.8 inches with thicknesses of up to 15mm (including the phone case). That means it works with bulky cases like Lifeproof or Otterbox, which adds further protection in case of bad weather or a crash.</p><p>Installation is easy and obviously doesn’t require swapping out phone cases. Simply pop onto your handlebar, tighten the quick release, and snap your phone in. it’s an easy on-and-off process if you’re moving the mount between a bike, a jogging stroller, a stationary bike, etc.</p><p>The mount includes adapters to fit handlebar diameters between 15mm and 30mm, so it’s best for commuters, cruisers, or spin bikes…most modern road, gravel &amp; mountain bikes have 31.8-35mm handlebar diameters at the center, so you’d have to mount it farther out from center on higher end bikes.</p><ul><li>Attachment style: Quick-release on handlebars</li><li>Case required?

The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/06/01/review-f3-cyclings-stealthy-formmount-cycling-computer-perch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">F3 FormMount Phone</a> requires zero straps or locking mechanisms, and instead uses neodymium magnets to lock your phone in place on your stem.</p><p>We also love the low profile and small size (2″ x 2″) of the mount itself, so it doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb when not in use. The magnetic power is surprisingly solid, and as one Bikerumor tester put it, “there is no effin way that bond is being broken in all but the worst of crashes.”</p><p>An adhesive-backed metal case plate with corresponding bumps to fit the bike mount goes on your phone, so you’ll need a smooth plastic or metal phone case: you can’t use a silicone case or put the plate directly on your phone. The plate then “sticks” to the magnets on the mount, and the bumps help lift it off with a twisting motion. (FormMount provides handy video guides for installation <a href=\"https://www.f3cycling.com/user-guides\">here</a>.)</p><p>Once installed, you’ll be able to adjust the mount up or down and align your phone horizontally as well as vertically, depending on if you’re using your phone as a camera or if you’re simply using it like a cycling computer.</p><ul><li>Attachment style: Attaches under the stem cap, around the steerer tube.</li><li>Case required?

Also great for a rider who always forgets to pack snacks, tools, or tubes, since you can pre-stock the bag itself with riding necessities. It attaches in three places with velcro and stays firmly in place while you ride.</p><p>While it’s obviously not as easy to use the phone while it’s in the bag, the clear window allows you to use your touch screen (not perfectly) through it well enough to respond to a text or refresh directions. The bag even has a sun visor to help keep the screen visible on super sunny days.</p><p>For casual riders, bikepackers, and endurance cyclists who regularly do long days in the saddle, the extra storage combined with the ability to see your phone wins over style points any day. Just note that it may impair shifting or braking performance on bikes that run those cables running along the top tube since the bag’s Velcro straps will cinch around them. And if you don’t have any spacers between your stem and headset cap, there’s nowhere for the front strap to go and the bag won’t be as stable.</p><ul><li>Attachment style: Velcro straps around the top tube and steerer tube</li><li>Case required?

Most bike phone mounts provide measurements or list the popular phones that will work with each model.</p><p><strong>Know how you plan to ride.</strong> If you always want to see your phone and you often ride in bad weather conditions, you’ll want a phone mount that can be used in conjunction with a protective case. If you’re a fair-weather rider and want to always have a great view of your phone, something that leaves your phone fully exposed, like Quadlock or FormMount, may be perfect.</p><p><strong>Check your bike’s compatibility.</strong> Depending on where you’re hoping to put your phone, certain mounts may work better than others. For instance, the FormMount Phone may not be ideal for someone with a really short stem, or who’s already using the bike’s stem to house a cycling computer.</p><p>Think about what you already have on your bars, and how you want to see your phone: Some people will struggle to look down and over, so a phone needs to be centered on their bars, while others won’t mind glancing slightly left or right. If you’re using it for navigation, the farther out in front of you it is, the safer it will be to glance at it while riding. And make sure your bike’s handlebars or stem are compatible with the case that you’re getting!</p><figure id=\"attachment_260198\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260198\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system.jpg\" alt=\"best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1175\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-297x218.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-800x588.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-120x88.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-768x564.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-1536x1128.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-696x511.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-1068x784.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-572x420.jpg 572w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-80x60.jpg 80w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-297x218.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-800x588.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-120x88.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-768x564.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-1536x1128.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-696x511.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-1068x784.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-572x420.jpg 572w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103518/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-80x60.jpg 80w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-260198\">The QuadLock is great, but it’s a commitment to the system.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Choose between a single piece or full system.</strong> Some mounts, like the Lamicall, are single pieces that snap onto your bike, then your phone snaps into the mount and you’re off on your ride. Others, like QuadLock, are full systems that require their own cases for your phone. While QuadLock is our favorite option, it does take away your ability to use an Otterbox case or a silicone wallet/credit card holder on your phone, so it’s a bigger commitment.</p><p>Choosing something like the QuadLock means buying into their system as a whole… Not bad, since they do have a great selection of other mounts for strollers, dashboards, desks, beltclips and even armbands for running or gym work.</p><p>If you are opting for a full system, we highly recommend sticking with a well-known brand (like QuadLock), since phone sizes are constantly changing and if you choose a bargain brand off of Amazon, you might find that your next iPhone doesn’t have a compatible case and your whole system no longer works for you.</p><h2 id=\"FAQ\">Frequently asked questions about bike phone mounts</h2><p><strong>Do I need a phone mount for my bike?</strong><br>Absolutely not. But you may find it useful, especially if your phone doubles as your GPS and your cycling computer, or you just like being able to quickly access your phone to take photos on rides. If you’re not sure you’ll like using one, opt for a mount that can be used for strollers, dashboards or other pieces of gear that you use often so that you have a secondary use for it if you hate having your phone on your bike.</p><figure id=\"attachment_260201\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260201\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103610/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27103610/best-cycling-phone-mounts-quadlock-system-2.jpg\" alt=\"best cycling phone mount -

That means you may need a new case when you upgrade your phone.</p><p><strong>How does a phone mount protect my phone?</strong><br>Most won’t, other than by not letting your phone hit the ground. They aren’t <em>cases</em> for your phone, they’re <em>holders</em> for it—and some may not even fit burlier cases like Otterboxes.
