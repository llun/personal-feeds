This lines up with a report from Japanese website <em>Mac Otakara</em>, which in January claimed that the number of speaker holes on the new iPad Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/new-ipad-pro-march-launch/\">will be reduced by two thirds</a>, although the reason for this supposed change is unclear.</p><p>A two-thirds reduction would work out as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro:</strong> 13 holes per speaker → 8-9 holes per speaker</li><li><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro:</strong> 17 holes per speaker → 11-12 holes per speaker</li></ul><p>The new iPad Pro models are still expected to feature four speakers for stereo sound, with two on the top edge and two on the bottom edge.</p><p>The new iPad Pro models are expected to be equipped with a faster A14X chip that is virtually identical to the M1 chip in the latest Macs. Last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that the new models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/\">could also feature Thunderbolt support</a>, which is certainly plausible given that the M1 chip supports Thunderbolt on Macs. Gurman also expects improved cameras and a Mini-LED display on at least the 12.9-inch model.</p><p><em>Mac Otakara</em> reported that the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be approximately 0.5mm thicker, whereas the 11-inch model will apparently have the same thickness, further suggesting that a Mini-LED display could be exclusive to the larger model.</p><p>The new iPad Pro is also expected to support 5G with a Qualcomm modem in cellular models.</p><p><img alt=\"esr airpods 3 case\" width=\"500\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/c-zjTzc4kPgTG_kZgiIlyZRS0Tk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/c-zjTzc4kPgTG_kZgiIlyZRS0Tk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/c-zjTzc4kPgTG_kZgiIlyZRS0Tk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/UXsTs9iwcF576dUWKZUap7OIYFk=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/fDNKrwo2-fG94rtHBE08SZ38T00=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/a8VJDBeWXN-KHIWzLccGG5Jmub0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/c-zjTzc4kPgTG_kZgiIlyZRS0Tk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/UXsTs9iwcF576dUWKZUap7OIYFk=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/fDNKrwo2-fG94rtHBE08SZ38T00=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/a8VJDBeWXN-KHIWzLccGG5Jmub0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg 2500w\"><br>As noted by <a href=\"https://iphonesoft.fr/2021/03/23/airpods-3-confirmes-avril-premieres-coques\">French website <em>iPhoneSoft</em></a>, ESR has also listed <a href=\"https://www.esrgear.com/categories/airpods-3-cases/\">new cases for third-generation AirPods</a> that suggest Apple's wireless charging case will be slightly elongated, as previously rumored. The new AirPods are expected to have a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but without Active Noise Cancellation or silicone ear tips to maintain differentiation.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/apple-stops-signing-ios-14-4-1/\">Apple Stops Signing iOS 14.4 Following Release of iOS 14.4.1</a></h3><p>Friday March 19, 2021 1:23 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Following the release of iOS 14.4.1 on March 8, Apple has stopped signing iOS 14.4, the previous version of iOS 14.
