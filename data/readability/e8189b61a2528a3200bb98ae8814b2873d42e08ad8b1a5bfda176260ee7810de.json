Then, with around 32 km left in the stage and 11 km left in the climb, he soloed clear and quickly worked up a sizable gap that no one would manage to close through the rest of the stage.</p><p>Behind, the Ineos Grenadiers rode a high tempo most of the way up the climb, dropping several riders out of the yellow jersey group, including Ben O’Connor (AG2R Citroën), who started the day in second overall. Shortly after the last Ineos rider, Michal Kwiatkowski, peeled off the front some 2 km from the top of the climb, Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) put in a stinging attack.</p><p>Race leader Tadej Pogačar followed the move at first, but before long he began to flag, while Vingegaard pressed on. The Dane took around half a minute over the top of the climb as Rigoberto Urán (EF Education-Nippo) and Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers) made their way back up to Pogačar. On the descent, however, the chasing trio closed down most of Vingegaard’s advantage before catching up to him as the road flattened out before the line.</p><p>Van Aert held on to take the stage victory, while Elissonde arrived 1:14 back to take runner-up honors with his Trek-Segafredo teammate Bauke Mollema just behind in third. A further 24 seconds later, Pogačar led Urán, Carapaz, and Vingegaard over the line together. O’Connor would arrive nearly four minutes behind quartet, allowing Urán to move into second overall with Vingegaard now in third and Carapaz in fourth.</p><div><div><p>Tour de France (2.UWT) <span>Sorgues → Malaucène</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ea/wout-van-aert-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e8189b61a2528a3200bb98ae8814b2873d42e08ad8b1a5bfda176260ee7810de","category":"Cycling"}
