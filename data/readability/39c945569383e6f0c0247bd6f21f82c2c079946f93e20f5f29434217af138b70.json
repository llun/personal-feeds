In order to grow its audience, it needs to be available to more people, and Apple TV+ took a big step towards that on Thursday as the Apple TV app became available on Chromecast with Google TV.</p><p>Users of the $50 Chromecast with Google TV can download the Apple TV app to the device and get access to Apple TV+ shows such as <em>Ted Lasso</em>, <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>Palmer</em>, and <em>The Snoopy Show</em>. Once the app is loaded on the device, you can access it through the \"Apps\" or \"For you\" tabs.&nbsp;You can also add TV+ shows to Google Watchlist, and Google Assistant can be used to verbally ask Google to launch the Apple TV app or play an Apple TV show.</p><p>The Apple TV app also gives you access to TV shows or movies you have purchased directly through Apple, and to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3384743/apple-tv-channels-faq-price-channels-list-availability.html\">Apple TV Channels</a>.</p><p>Apple TV+ is $4.99 per month, though Apple does offer a free year of the service when you buy a new Apple device. Apple has also extended that trial period a few times. If you decide to subscribe to other Apple services— Arcade, Fitness+, Music, News+, and iCloud—you can sign up for an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3575409/apple-one-faq.html\">Apple One</a> plan, a pricing plan that bundles Apple’s services together for discounts.</p><div><p><img onclick=\"jwplayer('bottomRightPlayer').remove(); this.style.display = 'none';\" id=\"jw-standalone-close-button\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"></p><div id=\"bottomRightPlayer\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Video Player\" role=\"application\" aria-describedby=\"jw-shortcuts-tooltip-explanation\"><div dir=\"auto\"><p>Apple Watch 6 vs SE vs 3: Which model is right for your wrist?</p></div><p><span aria-live=\"assertive\"></span><span aria-live=\"assertive\">Volume 0%</span></p></div></div><p>Initially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3601514/apple-tv-app-is-coming-to-chromecast-with-google-tv.html\">announced</a>&nbsp;last December, Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-tv/apple-tv-now-available/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announcement</a>&nbsp;on Thursday did not state if the Apple TV app supports HDR (including Dolby Vision) or Dolby Atmos. The device is capable of streaming HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision content, as well as Dolby Atmos audio. Google did state that the&nbsp;Apple TV app will also be available on TVs made by Sony and TCL that run Google software.</p><p>If you’re looking for an affordable alternative to Apple’s own Apple TV hardware, the Chromecast with Google TV may be it. At $50, it’s a lot cheaper than Apple’s Apple TV 4K ($179 for the 32GB version) and Apple TV HD ($149). The Chromecast supports 4K HDR streaming at up to 60 frames per second, and its hardware remote is a lot easier to use. And you don’t even need to use the remote—you can use voice commands.&nbsp;A recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> said that a new Apple TV box could include features such as improved performance for games, an updated remote control, and a new processor, but if all you want to do is get access to the Apple TV+ service, Apple TV Channels, or content you purchase directly from Apple, the Chromecast with Google TV looks like a great deal.</p><p>Chromecast with Google TV also has support for Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and Netflix. TechHive <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3584782/chromecast-with-google-tv-review.html\">reviewed</a> the Chromecast with Google TV when it was released last fall.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
