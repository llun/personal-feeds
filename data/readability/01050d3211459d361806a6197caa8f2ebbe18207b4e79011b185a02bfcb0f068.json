Prosser does not go into detail on reverse charging, but presumably this means that the battery pack will be able to charge an ‌iPhone 12‌ while also charging <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> from the other side at the same time.</p><p>Reverse charging could also mean that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> would be able to charge the battery pack, but that doesn't make much sense, so the ‌AirPods‌ scenario is more likely.</p><p>Prosser has a mixed track record when it comes to predicting Apple's plans and is not always accurate, so the reliability of this information is unclear and should be viewed with some skepticism until confirmed. Prosser claims that his source is \"not sure\" if Apple will release both of these battery packs or if only one will launch, so we may not see a version with reverse charging debut. Later this week, Prosser plans to release renders of the battery packs based on information from his source.</p><p>Apple's work on ‌iPhone 12‌ battery packs became apparent in mid-February after the launch of the second iOS 14.5 beta. There was a mention of a mysterious \"battery pack\" discovered in the code by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser, and <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-working-on-magsafe-battery-iphone-12/\">later confirmed </a>that Apple is indeed working on an ‌iPhone 12‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> battery pack.</p><p>Gurman did not mention a reverse charging possibility, but some of the prototypes were described as having a white rubber exterior. Gurman said that development on the accessory has been hindered by software issues that Apple is still working on fixing before releasing the accessory.</p><p>Bilateral wireless charging <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/01/two-way-wireless-charging-2019-iphones/\">was rumored for the 2019</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> models, but it did not end up being a feature that Apple implemented because the company wasn't able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/09/kuo-2019-iphone-expectations/\">make it work</a>. Two way wireless charging would have allowed an ‌iPhone‌ to charge another ‌iPhone‌ or to charge a small accessory like the ‌AirPods‌.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/bill-gates-prefers-android-over-iphone/\">Bill Gates Says His Preference for Android Over iPhone is Due to Pre-Installed Software</a></h3><p>Friday February 26, 2021 3:35 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates this week participated in his first meeting on Clubhouse, the increasingly popular invite-only conversation app, where he fielded a range of questions as part of an ongoing book tour.
