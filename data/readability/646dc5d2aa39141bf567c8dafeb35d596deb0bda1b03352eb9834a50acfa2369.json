Both the 512GB and 1TB SSD storage options are popular upgrade items as well, which makes for a significant inconvenience for buyers looking to purchase an ‌iMac‌ right now.</p><p>Timing for a launch of the redesigned ‌iMac‌ remains unclear, so we'll have to hold tight to see whether we get an update or Apple's component shortage is resolved for the current models. It's quite rare for Mac configurations to be completely unavailable for ordering, with Apple usually just pushing shipping estimates out significantly in cases of component shortages or stock drawdowns ahead of updates.</p><p>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">Kuo: New MacBook Pro Models With HDMI Port and SD Card Reader to Launch Later This Year</a></h3><p>Monday February 22, 2021 8:52 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple plans to release two new MacBook Pro models equipped with an HDMI port and SD card reader in the second half of 2021, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who outlined his expectations in a research note obtained by MacRumors.
