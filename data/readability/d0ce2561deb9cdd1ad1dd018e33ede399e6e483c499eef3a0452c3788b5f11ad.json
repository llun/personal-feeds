Last year’s iMac refreshes were <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634&amp;xcust=1-1-340440-0-0-0|xid:fr1616557097910dda&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/340440/a-new-imac-with-apple-silicon-may-be-coming-even-sooner-than-we-think.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-orig-url=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634&amp;xcust=1-1-340440-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/340440/a-new-imac-with-apple-silicon-may-be-coming-even-sooner-than-we-think.html\" data-ml-id=\"1\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1616557097910dda\">labeled iMac20,1,&nbsp;iMac20,2</a>.</p><p>But it still points to a possibly imminent release. While the existence of the identifiers doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> mean new iMacs are around the corner, it certainly lends some more fuel to that particular fire. A new iMac form factor has been rumored for more than a year, bringing a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234277/pro-display-xdr-inspired-imac-redesign-for-wwdc-teased-by-noted-apple-leaker.html\">Pro XDR Display-inspired redesign</a> that shrinks the bezels and eliminates the chin, and it stands to reason that the next Apple silicon-based Mac will be the iMac. New MacBooks are seemingly slated for the second half of 2021 and the Mac Pro isn’t rumored to arrive until 2022.</p><p>It’s been nearly 10 years since the iMac received its thin-edge design and another eight before it had its last major redesign. The current iMac form factor is basically a variation of the iMac G5 that replaced the iconic iMac G4 in 2004.</p></div><p><em>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
