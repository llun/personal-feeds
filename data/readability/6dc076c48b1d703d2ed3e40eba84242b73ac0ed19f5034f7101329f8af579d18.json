It will be the second year in a row the peloton will not race the Swedish races, both events were cancelled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>According to a statement on the website of the event the decision to cancel the races was due to economic uncertainty. “Great uncertainty about the pandemic affects the economy,” said Helen Henriksson, chairman of Vårgårda CK. “As a non-profit association, we can and do not dare to risk the association’s finances and survival.”</p><p>The financial risk of holding the event and having it get derailed was too great for the race organizers. “Now we can put all our energy into next year. Then we will arrange a real bike party,” said Henriksson.</p><p>The cancellation of two more days of WWT racing leaves an awkward gap in the WorldTour calendar. There was already a large gap between Liège-Bastogne-Liège on April 25th and the Vuelta a Burgos Feminas which started May 20th. With the cancellation of RideLondon on May 30th, the women will not race a WorldTour event until La Course by the Tour de France on June 26th.</p><p>Without Postnord Vargarda WestSweden there is another block without WWT racing between Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa on July 31st and then Ladies Tour of Norway on August 12th.</p><p>The TTT is the only stand-alone team time trial on the calendar. Since the road race was first held in 2006 it has been won by a handful of big names. The 2019 edition was won by Marta Bastianelli with Marianne Vos and Lorena Wiebes taking second and third.</p></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6dc076c48b1d703d2ed3e40eba84242b73ac0ed19f5034f7101329f8af579d18","category":"Cycling"}
