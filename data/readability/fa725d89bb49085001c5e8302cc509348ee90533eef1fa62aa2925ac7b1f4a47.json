As long as it can talk to the camera via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) or WiFi, they’ll be able to manipulate these features:</p><ul><li>Wireless connectivity</li><li>Camera status</li><li>Camera command and control</li><li>Preview</li><li>SD card access</li></ul><p>Launch partners include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazfit.com/en/#_blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazfit&nbsp;</a>smartwatches:<b>&nbsp;</b>wirelessly<b>&nbsp;</b>control your GoPro using the Amazfit watch touch display.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.centurionboats.com/#_blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centurion Boats</a>:<b>&nbsp;</b>wirelessly&nbsp;control&nbsp;your GoPro&nbsp;via&nbsp;the boat’s helm control screen.</li><li><a href=\"https://orqafpv.com/#_blank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Orqa</a>&nbsp;FPV Goggles: wirelessly&nbsp;control a GoPro mounted on an FPV drone using the Orqa FPV.Connect app and see camera status directly in the goggles.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.you.pixellot.tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixellot</a> sports&nbsp;broadcasting:&nbsp;wirelessly&nbsp;control GoPro cameras and manage the transfer of content&nbsp;via Pixellot’s mobile platform.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sena.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sena</a>&nbsp;Bluetooth® devices: take voice-control of your GoPro using the built-in mics on the Sena Communications&nbsp;50S and 50R&nbsp;headsets, ideal for motorcycle and other high-wind applications.</li></ul><p>With Sena also making road and mountain bike helmets that have Bluetooth, we’re hoping they’ll extend this option to those, too. But we could see some devices (like Garmin cycling computers that can already control lights) being added to the mix.</p><h2>GoPro HERO9 updates improve speed &amp; control</h2><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens.jpg\" alt=\"GoPro hero9 black action camera front view with new full color live view screen\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gopro-hero9-black-front-screen-and-removable-lens-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>As cool as the API stuff is, the more immediate reason to update your HERO9 today is that you’ll get the following improvements:</p><ul><li>Improved camera power on/power off speed and consistency</li><li>Improved Quik app connectivity</li><li>Improved touch screen sensitivity in menus and settings</li><li>Improved reliability when using ‘The Remote’ to control your camera</li></ul><p>It all comes in firmware update v1.6, available via GoPro’s Quik app and their website, which you’ll need to gain the OpenGoPro API capability.
