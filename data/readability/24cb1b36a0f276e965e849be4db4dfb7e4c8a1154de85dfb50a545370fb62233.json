{"title":"Moots reveals new Vamoots RCS 'all-road' titanium bike","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9166/moots-reveals-new-vamoots-rcs-all-road-titanium-bike","date":1611744090000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>Luxury American bike manufacturer Moots is celebrating its 40th birthday this year and is celebrating with a brand new bike, the Vamoots RCS.</p><p>Like the rest of the bikes in the Moots stable, the new Vamoots RCS has been created from idea conception to finished product at the brand's headquarters in Steamboat Springs in Colarado.</p><p>And like other Moots bikes, the new RCS is crafted from eye-catching double-butted titanium tubing and those darling 3D printed dropouts. However, unlike the preexisting road-orientated, snappy Vanmoots RSL or off-road loving, slack Routt RSL, the RCS has been created as the bike for all occasions.</p><p>That is because the new Vamoots RCS has been designed as an 'all-road bike' that is 'ideally suited to cover a mix of&nbsp;ever-changing surfaces; smooth pavement, rougher chipseal, and well-maintained dirt roads that are&nbsp;common road fare in Routt County, the home of Moots.'</p><p>And how has it done that? Wider tyre clearance and a racy geometry.</p><p>The new RCS has been designed around a 700x32mm tyre but can accept 35mm tyres. A full 5mm bigger than the Vamoots RSL, that extra rubber will not only increase comfort but add to the rider's option of terrains.</p><p>However, to differentiate the new RCS from the Routt RSL gravel-basher, with its long wheelbase and 45mm tyre clearance, the RCS has retained the road-orientated geometry of the Vamoots RSL for better handling in tight corners and a snappier feel on the road, although it is worth noting that each rider can opt for a custom geometry with the Vamoots RCS.</p><p>The common denominator across all of these Moots bikes is the use of titanium in the frame.</p><p>The double-butted Ti used for the RSL frame is individually butted for each frame size for optimum ride quality and strength while a combination of tack welding and second-pass 6/4 titanium alloy finishing weld is used for increased durability and Moots' signature 'stack-of-dimes' look.</p><p>Alongside the titanium frame is Moots's own tapered carbon fork and 3D-printed flat-mount thru-axle titanium dropouts designed 'for perfect rear axle and disc&nbsp;brake alignment.'</p><p>Each bike will come with customisable options including the choice of mudguard and rack mounts, additional bottle mounts, customisable geometry and the choice of paint finish, notably the new camo Hunter pattern. Claimed weight for a 56cm frame is 1,360g.</p><p>In the UK, the Vamoots RCS will come as a Di2-specced frameset priced at £6,900 and a mechanical alternative costing £6,600. For the Enve-wheel, Sram Red AXS eTap spec in the photos, you will be looking at forking out closer to the £11,000 mark.</p><p>For more, see the <a href=\"https://moots.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Moots site here</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"24cb1b36a0f276e965e849be4db4dfb7e4c8a1154de85dfb50a545370fb62233","category":"Cycling"}
