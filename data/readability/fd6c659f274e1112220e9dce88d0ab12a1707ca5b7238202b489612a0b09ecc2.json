{"title":"Rotor adds chainring options for Shimano GRX and SRAM AXS","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/rotor-adds-chainring-options-for-shimano-grx-and-sram-axs/","date":1622505844000,"content":"<div><div><p>There’s no denying that the likes of Shimano, SRAM and Campagnolo do a great job of producing quality chainrings to match their respective shifting systems, but sometimes those options can be a little limited. And those limitations certainly apply to the latest proprietary 12-speed groups and gravel-specific drivetrains. </p><p>Rotor has previously been one of the few aftermarket chainring options for SRAM AXS Road users (where the chain features a unique larger roller), and now the Spanish company has further expanded those options. Additionally, Rotor has made the first 2x oval rings to suit Shimano GRX cranks. </p><h2>For SRAM AXS users </h2><p>Rotor previously offered SRAM AXS Flat-Top chain compliant 48/35T rings in round and oval (aka Q-rings) shaping to suit 110 mm x four-bolt BCD cranks. These rings were designed to fit Rotor’s own cranks, among other similar-patterned options. </p><p>Last week Rotor added both round and oval options in a larger 50/37T size to suit the 110×4 BCD configuration. </p><p>Additionally, Rotor has introduced oval-shaped rings for users of SRAM Red AXS and Force AXS cranks. These Q-rings are available in both the 48/35T and 50/37T sizes and fit SRAM’s proprietary 107×4 BCD. </p><h2>For Shimano GRX users </h2><p>Keen for some oval-shaped Q-rings on the dirt? Rotor has you covered. </p><p>Rotor is now offering Q-rings in 48/31T and 46/30T combinations to fit Shimano’s GRX cranks (FC-RX810-2) with its unique 110/80×4 BCD. Like the SRAM-compatible Q-Rings, these also feature a 12.5% ovality. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ROTOR-Q-RINGS-Shimano-GRX-compatible-BCD110-80x4-copy-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Rotor’s 2x GRX rings are only available in an oval shape.</figcaption></figure><p>Those running Shimano GRX RX810 or RX600 1x cranks now have more options, too. Rotor has introduced a set of GRX-compatible chainring bolts that allow the fitment of Rotor’s 110×4 BCD 1x round or Q-rings. Rotor currently offers these rings in 40-54T sizes in two-tooth increments and in either round or oval shape. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ROTOR-Bolts-Shimano-GRX-compatible-copy-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>New stainless bolts aim to open up Rotor’s 1x rings for use on Shimano GRX 1x cranks.</figcaption></figure><p>You can find more information at <a href=\"http://rotorbike.com/\" target=\"_blank\">rotorbike.com</a> </p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"fd6c659f274e1112220e9dce88d0ab12a1707ca5b7238202b489612a0b09ecc2","category":"Cycling"}
