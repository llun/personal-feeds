Richie Porte would go two seconds faster to take over the provisional lead, but only briefly as Ion Izagirre would overtake him with a time of 21:44.</p><p>Izagirre’s Astana-Premier Tech teammate Lutsenko, however, was more than halfway through an impressive ride by that point. Lutsenko had set the third fastest time at the intermediate checkpoint and stepped it up for the second part of the course. A few minutes later, he arrived on a time of 21:36, besting Izagirre by eight seconds.</p><p>Geraint Thomas set the fastest time through the checkpoint but lost ground in the second part of the course and would arrive 23 seconds down on Lutsenko. Kasper Asgreen was the last rider to mount a challenge for the stage win, but he would settle for third behind Lutsenko and Izagirre after arriving nine seconds down.</p><p>Overnight leader Lukas Pöstlberger was the final rider on the course, and he put in an impressive performance to finish only 23 seconds slower than Lutsenko, good enough to finish ninth on the day and retain his lead by a single second, with Lutsenko moving into second overall.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"5f576a2866aa34d28cb6134c64fc5e1d91a32efd8659de20f50dbab459306475","category":"Cycling"}
