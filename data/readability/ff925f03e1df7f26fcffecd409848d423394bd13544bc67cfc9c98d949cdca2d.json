Based upon the 75kg weight he is given by <em>ProCyclingStats</em>, that would equate to just the 5.8W/KG for the race's final.</p><div id=\"file-43778\"><p><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/03/van-der-poel-watts.jpg?itok=_8Yg8_-J\" alt=\"\"></p></div><p>On the gravel sector of Le Tolfe, where Van der Poel launched his first big attack, he averaged 738W for 60 seconds, a move that could only be followed by Alaphilippe and Bernal.</p><p>Furthermore, Van der Poel's average wattage for the entire 4 hours 45 minutes of racing across 186km was 389W, 5.1W/KG for the entire race, something most amateurs would struggle to hold for a minute.</p><p>While it is slightly disappointing that claims Van der Poel hit '1 million watts' turned out to be fake news, there is no denying that he is the strongest rider in the peloton right now.</p><p>And the bad news for his rivals is that Van der Poel believes he can hold this incredible form 'for the next month'.</p><h2>Strade Bianche 2021 highlights gallery</h2></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"ff925f03e1df7f26fcffecd409848d423394bd13544bc67cfc9c98d949cdca2d","category":"Cycling"}
