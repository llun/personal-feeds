All team members will undertake further tests in the coming days, while they remain in isolation.'</p><p>It's not clear whether any riders are self-isolating or if this frees up Van der Poel to ride in the opening weekend of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/cycling-spring-classics\">Spring Classics</a> with Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Kuurne-Bruxelles-Kuurne on the 27th and 28th February respectively.</p><p>Van der Poel's initial schedule has him next appearing in either Paris-Nice or Tirreno-Adriatico, however if Covid restrictions and team plans allow him to make the trip to Belgium he'd immediately be the favourite, especially after his stage victory in UAE.</p></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"ada056169bb2f5c25d04b01c8e849281520e0e45c70e0e0a7f5db72515448b5b","category":"Cycling"}
