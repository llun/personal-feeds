The other members of the group include Charter, Cisco, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Keysight Technologies, LG, Mavenir, MITRE, and VMware.</p><p>In September, AT&amp;T said that it already has engineers working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/21/att-says-5g-iphones-might-not-be-massive-event/\">next-generation 6G networking</a>. Some analysts say the technology could enable speeds more than 100 times faster than 5G, but again, the technology isn't expected to arrive for several years to come.</p><p>The move continues a trend of Apple preferring to develop in-house hardware for its devices, rather than relying on third-parties. In 2019, Apple and Qualcomm settled a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">legal battle</a> and reached a multiyear chipset supply agreement that paved the way for Apple to use Qualcomm's 5G modems in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models.</p><p>Beyond that, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/apple-qualcomm-5g-modem-roadmap/\">court document</a> from the settlement revealed that Apple will likely use the the Snapdragon X60 modem for 2021 iPhones, followed by the world's first 10 Gigabit 5G modem, the Snapdragon X65, in 2022 iPhones.</p><p>The Snapdragon X65 could be the last Qualcomm modem used in iPhones, however, as Barclays analysts and multiple other sources have forecasted that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-developing-modem-in-house/\">switch to its own in-house 5G modem</a> for iPhones by 2023.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
