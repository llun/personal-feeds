On January 28, Microsoft also <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacks-against-security-researchers/\">reported</a> that attackers most likely used a Chrome zero-day for their attacks.</p><p>The proximity of the two events has led security researchers to suspect that it was indeed the CVE-2021-21148 zero-day that was used in the attacks. As a result, all users are being advised to use the Chrome menu bar's <strong>About Google Chrome</strong> option to upgrade their browser to the latest version as soon as possible.</p><p>Google Chrome for Mac is a free download available directly from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Google's servers</a>. <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/utilities/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> for iOS is a free download for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
