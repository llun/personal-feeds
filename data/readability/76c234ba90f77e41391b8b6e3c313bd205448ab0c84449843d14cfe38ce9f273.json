They recently launched an Adaptive Training method that combines machine learning and science-based coaching to adjust training plans based on coaches feedback. The goal? “So you get the right workout, every time”. &nbsp;</p><p>This week Ronan chats with TrainerRoad co-founder and CEO Nate Pearson about the new Adaptive Training and explains just how it knows what it’s doing. They also discuss what the future might hold and if Adaptive Training can replace coaching as we know it.&nbsp;</p><hr><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div><div data-block-name=\"block-author\"><p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/author/abby145674/\"><img width=\"75\" height=\"75\" src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/35485173_10213353944577767_89503192848531456_n-aspect-ratio-75-75.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/35485173_10213353944577767_89503192848531456_n-aspect-ratio-75-75.jpg 75w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/35485173_10213353944577767_89503192848531456_n-aspect-ratio-75-75-16x16.jpg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 75px) 100vw, 75px\"></a></p></div></div><div><h2>Editors Picks</h2></div></div></article></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"76c234ba90f77e41391b8b6e3c313bd205448ab0c84449843d14cfe38ce9f273","category":"Cycling"}
