My fat bike is in the shop so I am riding my wife’s Surly Moonlander, ‘Fatniss Everdeen’, pink accents and all. It was a cool morning where the temperature was about -29C…so cold my Garmin froze and stopped working about 20 minutes into the ride.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
