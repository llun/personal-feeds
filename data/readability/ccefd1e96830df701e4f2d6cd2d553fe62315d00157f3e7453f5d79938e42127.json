The document outlines how a flexible display could span the entire watch face and the band of a smartwatch for a transformational new Apple Watch design. The elongated display itself is said to be flexible enough to contour to the shape of a user's arm to fit like a normal watch band.</p><blockquote><p>In one application, embodiments of the invention describe a wearable electronic device, such as a smartwatch, including a flexible display panel and flexible display module. In this manner, the display area of the smartwatch is not limited to a rigid watch face area. In an embodiment, a smartwatch includes a flexible display panel that is integrated into a flexible watch band. Accordingly, curvature of the flexible display panel in both the watch face area and band may be adjusted to conform to the wrist size of the user... the display area of the flexible display panel can cover more available space on the watch face area and band of the smartwatch.</p></blockquote><p>Apple explains that the design includes a display with a \"plurality of interconnects\" that extend \"through the display substrate from the front surface to the back surface, and an array of LEDs are in the display area and electrically connected with the plurality of interconnects.\" A battery, processor, ambient light sensor, and other vital smartwatch components can be fixed within an enclosure to the rear of the large display unit.</p><p><img alt=\"apple watch wrap around display patent

entirely:</p><blockquote><p>In accordance with embodiments of the invention, a bezel width surrounding the display panel can be minimized, for example below 4-5 mm or even less than 1 mm, less than 0.5 mm, or eliminated. Thus, the bezel design of the smartwatch can be designed for aesthetic concerns rather than as a requirement for allocating space for a contact ledge.</p></blockquote><p>As well as being able to select a watch face design, as on current Apple Watch models, the patent explains that users could similarly select a digital band design to be shown on the band segment of the wrap-around display using an \"accessory manager\" to create a unique look. The filing describes a very similar system for selecting band designs as is currently in place for selecting and customizing watch faces, with the option to do so both on the Apple Watch itself or on a connected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The input is parsed to derive the data for display, and the derived data is displayed on the display area, where the display area is on a flexible display substrate spanning a face and band of the wearable electronic device. For example, the wearable electronic device may be a smartwatch. In an embodiment, the non-transitory computer-readable medium stores additional instructions to perform additional operations including receiving a configuration of the display area of the watch face and band, receiving a design from the derived data, the design including a watch face and watch band, and updating the display area with the received design.</p></blockquote><p><img alt=\"apple watch wrap around display patent design ab\" width=\"1850\" height=\"1889\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/OXr1fCGA8QwMFEBksUrHAW7y9Gg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/OXr1fCGA8QwMFEBksUrHAW7y9Gg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/OXr1fCGA8QwMFEBksUrHAW7y9Gg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Q3Hsh3MxN293fuJhWukZdRMghAg=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/nMQx7aqzU16CnEGK1o9i8l4Kruc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ODGHAxMauMi-8sM1hQkgp65k0TI=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/OXr1fCGA8QwMFEBksUrHAW7y9Gg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Q3Hsh3MxN293fuJhWukZdRMghAg=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/nMQx7aqzU16CnEGK1o9i8l4Kruc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ODGHAxMauMi-8sM1hQkgp65k0TI=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/apple-watch-wrap-around-display-patent-design-ab.jpg 2500w\"></p><p>Although the Apple Watch's Digital Crown does not appear to be depicted in the design, a separate patent has today been published with the title \"<a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=50&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;p=1&amp;S1=(%22Apple+Inc%22.AANM.)&amp;OS=AANM/%22Apple+Inc%22&amp;RS=AANM/%22Apple+Inc%22\">Capacitive gap sensor ring for an input device</a>,\" explaining how the Digital Crown could use two \"nested\" capacitive rings that move against each other to gain a wider range of input information.</p><p><img alt=\"digital crown patent rings capacitive\" width=\"1850\" height=\"1156\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/jIedNIue9obNlAN1RnMxi8FNg3I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/jIedNIue9obNlAN1RnMxi8FNg3I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/jIedNIue9obNlAN1RnMxi8FNg3I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Rq176sbKNxA-qmL5n9T6StEEaa0=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Obh2S4c0oKk0QxPgv-BeaEasWV0=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/k8GmGuBfFAvKy8Ip89rmsgpeg5k=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/jIedNIue9obNlAN1RnMxi8FNg3I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Rq176sbKNxA-qmL5n9T6StEEaa0=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Obh2S4c0oKk0QxPgv-BeaEasWV0=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/k8GmGuBfFAvKy8Ip89rmsgpeg5k=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/digital-crown-patent-rings-capacitive.jpg 2500w\"><br>While Apple has yet to release a device with a flexible display, the company is believed to be working on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">iPhone with a foldable display</a>.
