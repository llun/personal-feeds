The first and second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ have small, screw-on tips that are able to be easily replaced when worn out. This updated model seems to have a considerably larger tip component, with a much longer section that screws into the ‌Apple Pencil‌ itself. It is unclear why a new version of the ‌Apple Pencil‌ may have a redesigned tip, but it is likely indicative of internal design changes.</p><p>The redesigned head may signal that new functionality is coming to the ‌Apple Pencil‌'s tip. In July last year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/\">applied for a patent</a> regarding an ‌Apple Pencil‌ tip that would allow the device to sample colors from the real world via a color sensor, so it is clear that Apple is interested in expanding the utility of its ‌iPad‌ stylus.</p><p>All in all, the image suggests that the new ‌Apple Pencil‌'s upgrades may be more focused on the internals of the accessory rather than any significant external design changes. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to expect some added functionality over the current model to justify a new iteration of the device.</p><p>\"Mr. White\" has previously leaked correct <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/08/alleged-ipad-mini-5-photos/\">images of the iPad mini 5</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/iphone-12-pro-rear-glass-photo-shows-lidar-scanner/\">back glass of the Graphite iPhone 12 Pro</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/supposed-iphone-12-display-unit-leaks/\">iPhone 12 mini's display</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/a14-chip-component-iphone-12/\">A14 chip components</a>.
