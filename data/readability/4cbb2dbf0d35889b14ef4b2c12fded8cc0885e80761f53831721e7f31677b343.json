Following recent discussions of the rather more popular frame materials, aluminium and carbon, this week we turn to good old fashioned steel.</p><p>There’s a multitude of steel tubing options out there for bike frame fabrication, and different manufacturers have different preferences, dependent on the type of bicycle they’re creating. This week we have a selection of expert frame builders and designers from small to medium sized brands:</p><ul><li>Ira Ryan, Co-Founder and Frame Builder at <a href=\"https://breadwinnercycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Breadwinner Cycles</a></li><li>Alan Finlay, Founder and Designer at <a href=\"https://www.pipedreamcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pipedream Cycles</a></li><li>Joe McEwan, Founder and Frame Builder at <a href=\"https://www.starlingcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starling Cycles</a></li></ul><p><strong>What type of steel tubing is best for bicycle frame fabrication, and does it differ depending on the style of frame you’re building (mountain, road, gravel, full suspension)?</strong></p><p><strong>Breadwinner Cycles:</strong> I wish there was a straightforward answer but it’s more nuanced than that.</p><p>There are many options for bicycle frame materials out there and they each have pluses and minuses to them. We feel strongly that high end steel is the best balance for a light weight bicycle frame. Breadwinner Cycles has been building with Columbus tubing since day one and I have been using Columbus steel since 2005.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike.jpg\" alt=\"breadwinner cycles steel road frame blue\" width=\"1200\" height=\"797\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-297x197.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-800x531.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-768x510.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-696x462.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-1068x709.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/25144208/breadwinner-cycles-steel-road-bike-632x420.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>Lumping all steel chromoly tubing into one category is a bit misleading.

But we can simplify this complex choice very quickly with a couple of useful bits of information about weight and stiffness.</p><figure id=\"attachment_258365\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-258365\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19.jpg\" alt=\"starling cycles stainless steel full suspension mountain bike\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10083525/Starling-Cycles-Demo-Fleet-Dave-Price-Photo-19-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-258365\">Starling Cycles did a limited edition run of 15 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/10/starling-cycles-release-15-ltd-ed-stainless-murmur-enduro-frames-with-bare-metal-finish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stainless steel Murmur frames</a>… once upon a time</figcaption></figure><p>First, weight. All steels, within a small tolerance, are the same density: 7,800 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. This is the same for cheap mild steel and top end stainless. So, why do different frames weigh different amounts?

In the case of a bike frame, the overall stiffness is a function of the bike design, and in the example of a typical double diamond frame, a function of frame overall geometry and of tube diameter and wall thickness. Tube diameter dominates the local stiffness (bending, shear, tension, torsion) of a tube massively, but wall thickness has an impact too.</p><figure id=\"attachment_237449\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-237449\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed.jpg\" alt=\"Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Starling-Cycles-Sturn-DH-Bike-high-pivot-suspension-platform-jack-shaft-drivetrain-single-speed-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-237449\">All of Starling Cycles’ mountain bike frames are fabricated from steel tubing, including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/07/12/workshop-tour-the-story-of-steel-mtb-frame-building-with-starling-cycles-joe-mcewan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sturn DH MTB</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s consider weight and stiffness together.

Typically, the stronger materials are less ductile, i.e. more brittle. This leads to worse fatigue strength. But in reality, steel is plenty strong, and it is often bad design features and poor welds that lead to fatigue failures.</p><p>As discussed earlier, a stronger steel means you can use less of it to achieve a certain strength and stiffness, so less weight. However, there is a bit of a limit to this with regards to wall thickness. If the walls get too thin, they will just buckle under load (a function of Young’s Modulus, not material strength) or they will be susceptible to impact damage.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"starling cycles founder joe mcewan\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Starling-cycles-Joe-McEwan-Murmur-Factory-1536x1024-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>So, once you have a frame that’s strong and stiff enough to achieve what you want it to, there’s no benefits in using stronger materials, you can’t make the walls any thinner to save weight.</p><p>Next, we’ll consider manufacturability.

We’d firstly need to select tube diameters to achieve the stiffness we need. We’d then be compromising between cost and weight; stronger but more costly steel means we can use thinner wall thickness and have less weight. Cheap, weak tubes need more wall thickness and will be heavier.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1.jpg\" alt=\"starling-Twist-mullet\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/starling-Twist-mullet-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>But, as discussed, all are limited by a minimum wall thickness for buckling and local impacts. So, how does this affect different frames types?</p><p>For a road bike you are after the lightest weight, so you’d throw money at it to get the strongest tubes and thinnest walls. It’s less prone to impacts, so you’d maybe compromise a little and risk thinner wall thickness.</p><p>For a kids bike, the loading is very low, so you could get away with low strength/cheap tubes, but still achieve small thin tubes for a light weight frame.</p><p>For a mountain bike? Well, they are very susceptible to impacts. So, you can’t compromise on wall thickness. This means you don’t necessarily need to use the highest grade steel to achieve the required strength and stiffness, even with the big loads they see.</p><figure id=\"attachment_218421\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-218421\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel-.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel-.jpg\" alt=\"reynolds 85s steel flex\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel-.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel-.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel-.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Starling-Cycles-murmur-steel--630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-218421\">All of Joe’s bikes are fitted with a starling brace plate</figcaption></figure><p>Gravel is silly.
