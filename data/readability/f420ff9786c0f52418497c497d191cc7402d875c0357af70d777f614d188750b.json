He quickly jumped out to a gap of a few seconds but the pack started to close him back down inside the last few hundred meters.</p><p>As Thomas rounded a final bend, he looked back and saw stage 3 winner Sonny Colbrelli fast approaching from behind. The Italian closed in and very nearly pulled past, but Thomas held on just barely to take the stage victory.</p><p>Colbrelli settled for his third second-place finish so far in the race with Alex Aranburu taking third. Lukas Pöstlberger finished safely in the bunch to retain his GC lead.</p><div><div><p>Critérium du Dauphiné (2.UWT) <span>Saint-Chamond → Saint-Vallier</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/dd/geraint-thomas-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f420ff9786c0f52418497c497d191cc7402d875c0357af70d777f614d188750b","category":"Cycling"}
