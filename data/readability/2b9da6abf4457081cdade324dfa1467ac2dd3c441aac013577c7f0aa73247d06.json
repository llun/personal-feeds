Apple is said to have independently developed most of the necessary software and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for the vehicle, but the so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a>\" is still believed to be years away from a potential release.</p><p>From the report:</p><blockquote><p>The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is in active talks with a number of potential suppliers for these laser-based sensors that allow a car's computer to \"see\" its surroundings, said the people, who asked not to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions. The company has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years and has developed on its own most of the necessary software, underlying processors and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for such a sophisticated system.</p></blockquote><p>In regulatory filings earlier this month, Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia said they are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/07/hyundai-says-not-in-apple-car-discussions/\">not in discussions with Apple over development of a self-driving vehicle</a>.
