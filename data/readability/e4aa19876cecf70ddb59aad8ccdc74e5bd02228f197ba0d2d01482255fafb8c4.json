specific benchmark tasks to demonstrate that Windows laptops powered by its latest 11th Generation Core processors are superior to Macs with Apple's custom M1 chip, such as exporting a PowerPoint presentation as a PDF file.</p><p>Intel also used different processor SKUs depending on the test, and switched from the 13-inch MacBook Pro to the MacBook Air for the battery life test, so there are lots of inconsistencies throughout the slideshow.</p><p>\"Inconsistent test platforms, shifting arguments, omitted data, and the not-so-faint whiff of desperation,\" said Apple columnist Jason Snell, writing for Six Colors. \"Today's M1 processor is a low-end chip for low-end systems, so Intel only has a small window to compare itself favorably to these systems before higher-end Apple silicon Macs ship and make its job that much harder.\"<br></p><h2>Apple Offering Free Battery Replacements for 2016-2017 MacBook Pros That Can't Charge Past 1%</h2><p>Apple this week <a
