Calling it <em>The Fastest Wheel</em>, the Vision development team has been refining the perfect balance of lightweight and aerodynamics in their next-gen tubeless-ready carbon TT wheel for the last four years to create what they say is the lightest disc wheel in the peloton. And you’ll be able to buy yours soon… if you can stomach the high price tag!</p><figure id=\"attachment_252793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-252793\"><a
