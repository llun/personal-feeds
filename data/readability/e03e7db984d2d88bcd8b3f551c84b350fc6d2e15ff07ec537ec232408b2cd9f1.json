Disney is also set to bring more Marvel movies to subscribers in Europe within a year.</p><p>February 23 is the date that the app will be added to Disney+ for existing subscribers in the above regions. The European countries set to get the Star content include the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland.</p><p>The Star brand and additional content arrive at a cost, though, as Disney+ is getting a price bump in these regions. In the U.K., the monthly subscription rate is set to increase from £5.99 to £7.99, or £59.99 to £79.90 per year, with an equivalent increase in the EU in euros. Current subscribers however will enjoy a pay freeze until August 23.</p><p>The increased cost is in line with a $1 price hike for subscribers in the United States that will come into effect on March 26.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/14/heart-month-activity-challenge/\">Apple's Heart Month Activity Challenge Requires 60 Minutes of Exercise on Valentine's Day</a></h3><p>Saturday February 13, 2021 10:15 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/frank-mcshan/\" rel=\"author\">Frank McShan</a></p><p>Today only, Apple Watch owners can complete a new Apple Watch activity challenge in celebration of Heart Month, which is aimed at promoting cardiovascular health.
