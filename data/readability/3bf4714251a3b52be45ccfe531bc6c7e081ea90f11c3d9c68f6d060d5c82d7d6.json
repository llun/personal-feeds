{"title":"Intel Dunks on Apple's Dongles in Continued Anti-M1 Mac Campaign","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/intel-anti-dongle-m1-mac-ad/","date":1616087146000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div role=\"main\"><article expanded=\"true\"><div data-io-article-url=\"/2021/03/18/intel-anti-dongle-m1-mac-ad/\"><p>Intel is continuing its anti-Apple ad campaign, today sharing a tweet that calls out the lack of ports on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs. In a photo, actor Justin Long sits on a couch with a Windows PC and holds up a handful of Apple dongles.</p><p>Apple's Macs have long been derided for their lack of ports and the need to use dongles for various accessories and displays. Since 2016, Macs have included only USB-C ports, with Apple having done away with HDMI ports, USB-A ports, and SD card readers in its notebook lineup. That's set to change in 2021, though, with rumors suggesting Apple will introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">new MacBook Pro models</a> that once again feature an SD card reader and an HDMI port.</p><p>Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, who shared Apple's future port plans in January, said that in the future, \"most users may not need to purchase additional dongles.\"</p><p>The ad follows several anti-M1 Mac videos that Intel shared yesterday starring Justin Long, who used to be in the well-known \"I'm a Mac\" Apple ads. In the videos, Long promotes Intel-based PCs, highlighting their gaming capabilities, touchscreens, and other features.</p><p>Intel's ads come as Apple is moving away from Intel chips in its Mac lineup. Apple in November released the ‌M1‌ chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and there are more Apple silicon chips on the way. Over the course of the next two years, Apple plans to transition away from Intel chips entirely.</p><p>The Justin Long ads are not the first anti-Apple ads that Intel has shared. In February, Intel began a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/intel-anti-mac-ad-campaign/\">Twitter-based campaign</a> attempting to point out the shortcomings of ‌M1‌ Macs. Intel appears to be feeling threatened by Apple's chip options. ‌M1‌ chips received a huge amount of attention at launch due to their impressive speed and efficiency, which Intel chips are unable to match.</p><p>Apple has even faster chips on the way, and there will be little for Intel to call out once MacBook Pro models with next-generation Apple silicon chips and a range of ports are available.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad/\">Apple Shares 'Jump' AirPods Pro Ad</a></h3><p>Sunday March 14, 2021 9:09 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple today shared a new AirPods Pro-focused ad called \"Jump\" on its YouTube channel, highlighting the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency features of the earbuds in a creative way.
