After a late attack on the Poggio from Julian Alaphilippe (it had to come at some point), a fairly large group crested the climb together. A cagey descent followed where INEOS' Tom Pidcock came to the front to increase the rythym, but well over ten riders were still together.&nbsp;</p><p>After some brief looking around, Trek-Segafredo's Jasper Stuyven exited the descent of the Poggio on the attack. He quickly found himself a few seconds up the road with 2km to become the winnner of a monument. <span>Søren Kragh Andersen</span> of Team DSM bridged to Stuyven and the two collaborated to hold their slender lead over the group of favourites.</p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a>&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-womens-2021-early-season-a-guide\">Related –&nbsp;</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-womens-2021-early-season-a-guide\"><strong><span>The Women's 2021 Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</span></strong></a></em></p><p>Behind, there was a lot of reliance on last year's winner Wout Van Aert to close the gap. However, Caleb Ewan had carried out the climb of his life on the Poggio to stay with the best punchers in the world, meaning Van Aert had one of the&nbsp;peloton's quickest riders&nbsp;glued to his back wheel.</p><p>Into the final few hundred metres and with just seconds between the two groups, the fast chasing pack launched their sprint with Ewan and Van Aert leading the charge. As Kragh Andersen faded, Stuyven kicked to the line. Despite Ewan, Van Aert and Sagan closing quickly, the Trek-Segafredo rider held them off in fine fashion to win the first monument of his career. Caleb Ewan finished second for the second time, (he finished behind Nibali in 2018), with Van Aert crossing the line in third.</p><p>Here's our Milan-San Remo 2021 gallery...</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cyclis-3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616426267\" alt=\"Canyon bike Milan San Remo\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-39_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423815\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 Start\">This photo was not taken at a decisive moment of the race...</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-36_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423757\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 Start\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-17_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423847\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 Van der Poel\">Mathieu van der Poel back wearing white shorts...</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423907\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cyclis-6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423933\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-15_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423962\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 Van Aert\">Staying focused throughout the 300km at MSR is crucial in preserving energy and staying upright.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-14_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616423982\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 INEOS\">The INEOS Grenadiers bossing the front of the peloton in the lead-up to the Poggio.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cyclis-9_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616424020\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 \"></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-19_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616424378\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021 Finish Stuyven\">Jasper Stuyven celebrates as Caleb Ewan, Wout Van Aert and Peter Sagan just miss out.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-34_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616424444\" alt=\"Jasper Stuyven celebrates his win\">What it takes to win a monument.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_583900_cycli-41_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616424478\" alt=\"Stuyven celebrates his win\">Jasper Stuyven celebrates the first monument of his career.</p><p><em>Images:&nbsp;Presse Sports / Offside</em></p></div></div></article></div></div>","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"89c97ddcf169def8f907bfcb6238f570bb321005fa8dae8ab5dfba9a5641db12","category":"Cycling"}
