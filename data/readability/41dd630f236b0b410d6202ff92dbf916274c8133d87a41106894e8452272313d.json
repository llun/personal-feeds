The change may be in line with a number of amendments to ‌Apple Music‌'s artwork that have taken place <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/07/apple-music-animated-artwork/\">over the last year</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/11/apple-music-animated-album-artwork/\">animated album covers</a>.</p><p>The change, first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/m83bgp/did_apple_really_remove_the_profile_pictures_out/\">users on Reddit</a>, appears to have taken place very recently. Some users seem to be unhappy about the change, commenting that the \"profile picture variant made it feel more personal than this.\" Another downside seems to be that when listening to another user's personal radio station now, the only way to tell who the station is from is by a small profile picture in the bottom right-hand corner, rather than from the artwork itself.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/\">Former 'I'm a Mac' Actor Justin Long Throws Shade at M1 Apple Silicon in New Intel Ad Campaign</a></h3><p>Wednesday March 17, 2021 5:10 am PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/sami-fathi/\" rel=\"author\">Sami Fathi</a></p><p>Intel has called on the services of former \"I'm a Mac\" actor Justin Long in a series of new ads in which Apple's latest custom-made M1 processors are cast as inferior to newer laptops powered by Intel processors.
