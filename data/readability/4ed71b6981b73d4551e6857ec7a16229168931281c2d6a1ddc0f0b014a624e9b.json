The repetition involved can be tedious and draining for children, which is why the \"Saylists\" are designed to add a fun and engaging element to that experience.</p><p>So far, the algorithm has selected 173 tracks that meet its criteria, including Dua Lipa's \"Don't Start Now,\" Lizzo's \"Good As Hell,\" and Fatboy Slim's \"Right Here, Right Now.\"<br></p><blockquote><p>Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists chief executive Kamini Gadhok told BBC News: \"We're always pleased to hear about innovative approaches that support speech-and-language therapists in their work. As with all new techniques and tools, we recommend effective evaluation and monitoring of outcomes.\"</p></blockquote><p>The \"Saylists\" are English-language only and can only be accessed by ‌Apple Music‌ subscribers in the United Kingdom, where one in 12 children experience some form of SSD. Whether the program will be extended to other regions and territories remains unknown.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> ‌Apple Music‌ \"Saylists\" will in fact be available globally, <em>MacRumors</em> can confirm.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">iPhone 13 Front Glass Reveals Smaller Notch With Earpiece Relocated to Top Bezel</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models are widely expected to feature a smaller notch, and we are able to share a first look at the potential design.
