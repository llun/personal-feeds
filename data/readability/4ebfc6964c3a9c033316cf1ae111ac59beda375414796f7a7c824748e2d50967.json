The timing of Note model launch can be changed but we seek to release a Note model next year.\"</p></blockquote><p><em>Reuters</em> reported earlier this week that Qualcomm is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/qualcomm-processor-shortages-samsung-impact/\">struggling to keep up</a> with processor demand from Samsung. The wider implications of the shortage are still unclear; however, delaying a device that is usually launched annually would be significant.</p><p>The shortage is not expected to impact Apple, as it manufactures its own chips in partnership with TSMC.
