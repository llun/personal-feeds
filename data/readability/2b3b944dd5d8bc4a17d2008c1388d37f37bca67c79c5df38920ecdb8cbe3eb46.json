But Apple also likes to make such changes when new hardware is coming, and there have been rumors that new Apple TV hardware could be available this year. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230596/apple-tv-4k-review.html\">Apple TV 4K</a> was originally released in September 2017, and the Apple TV HD made its debut two years earlier.</p><p>Furthermore, Moser has also found <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/&amp;xcust=1-1-340537-0-0-0|xid:fr1616679507836dah&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/340537/tvos-14-5-beta-new-siri-remote-facetime-support.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-orig-url=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/&amp;xcust=1-1-340537-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/340537/tvos-14-5-beta-new-siri-remote-facetime-support.html\" data-ml-id=\"3\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1616679507836dah\">FaceTime and iMessage frameworks</a> in the code as well as a new AVFCapture framework related to capturing images. That could mean a HomePod with a microphone, speaker, and camera are on the way, or one with the potential to tap into third-party cameras. The current tvOS only supports FaceTime via AirPlay streaming.</p><p>Moser has a Twitter thread that points out other changes in tvOS 14.5, including a “Type to Siri” feature, support for “Other Wireless Speakers,” and a redesigned Podcasts section. Other features that have been revealed in earlier betas of tvOS 14.5 include support for the latest PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X controllers and a change of the&nbsp;refresh rates settings&nbsp;from&nbsp;30Hz and 60Hz to the more specific 29.97Hz and 59.94Hz.</p><p>It’s possible some of these references are related to HomePod, as the two devices share a common OS.
