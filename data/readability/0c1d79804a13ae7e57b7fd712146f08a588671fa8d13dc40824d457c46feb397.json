Shortcuts have continued to be popular since their debut, and in iOS 14, the addition of Home screen widgets made it even easier to get to your Shortcuts, so we thought we'd round up some of our most useful Shortcut options for iPhone and iPad.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7620/\"><strong>Photos Toolkit</strong></a> - Photos ToolKit is an all-in-one shortcut that can resize images, convert images to different formats, rotate images, combine images in a collage, make GIFs, and more.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/534bc73670064501895f5982c07a2d13\"><strong>Make PDF</strong></a> - As the name suggests, the Make PDF shortcut can turn documents and webpages into PDFs.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/ios/shortcuts-corner-apple-frames-for-iphone-12-and-se-get-image-resolution-encode-images-to-base64-and-search-articles-in-reeder/\"><strong>Apple Frames</strong></a> - Apple Frames from from <em>MacStories</em>' Federico Viticci adds frames to screenshots taken with your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch and makes them look nicer. It's a favorite that we use often here at <em>MacRumors</em>.</li><li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/663/\"><strong>Dictate to Notes</strong></a> - With Dictate to Notes, you can use voice dictation to create a note in the Notes app, which is useful for jotting down quick thoughts without having to type something out.</li><li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/6622/\"><strong>YouTube PiP</strong></a> - If you want to be able to watch YouTube in Picture in Picture mode on the iPhone, this is the app for you. With an app called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188\">Scriptable</a>, when you run YouTube PiP through the Share Sheet, it will open a YouTube video in a floating window.</li><li><a href=\"https://routinehub.co/shortcut/7290/\"><strong>Music Finder</strong></a> - To identify a song that's playing nearby you can use Shazam, but Shazam saves music to Apple Music, which is not ideal if you're a Spotify user. Music Finder identifies a song and saves it to your Spotify playlist.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c9ddf062fead4fe89850fb16b406b62c\"><strong>Set AirPlay</strong></a> - Set AirPlay makes it easier to swap between your iPhone and your other AirPlay devices, saving you a few taps if you want to switch sources quickly.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0c06d1131960494f91b5d35896d5cedf\"><strong>Url Shortener</strong></a> - URL Shortener makes long and unsightly URLs shorter, which is useful when you need to share a naked URL. It lives in the Share Sheet, so all you have to do is select the Shorten URL option when viewing a website and it will generate a short URL. Alternatively, you can copy a link and run it from the Shortcuts app, which will shorten the last copied URL.</li></ul><p>Do you have a favorite Shortcut?
