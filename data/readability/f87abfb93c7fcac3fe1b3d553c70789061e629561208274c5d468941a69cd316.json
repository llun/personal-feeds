{"title":"Bike of the Week | The Felt Breed is a gravel race bike with a versatile streak","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/felt-breed-20/","date":1614182457000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><section itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p><span>The Breed is Felt’s dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gravel bike</a> for 2021 and the £2,159 / €2,399 / $2,899 Breed 20 is the more expensive of two available builds.</span></p><p><span>Somewhat confusingly, Felt sells the Breed range alongside its Broam adventure road bike. Both bikes use aluminium frames and are geared up to go off-road.</span></p><p><span>The way we’ve interpreted the lineup is Felt’s Breed is more of a gravel race bike while the Broam is more of an explorer with less of an emphasis on speed. The Broam is also significantly cheaper, with complete builds starting from just £1,249 / €999 / $1,299.</span></p><div><p><i title=\"Enlarge photo\" data-slide-index=\"1\">Enlarge photo</i></p><div><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 320px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><source media=\"(max-width: 375px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><source media=\"(max-width: 425px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><source media=\"(max-width: 600px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><source media=\"(max-width: 991px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><source media=\"(min-width: 992px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"><img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/02/felt_breed_russ_b_001-9ca3365.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=960%2C640\" alt=\"Felt Breed 20 gravel bike\" height=\"640\" width=\"960\"></picture><div><p><i><svg width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><title>icon / camera</title><g fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M10 12.08a1.6 1.6 0 1 1 0-3.204 1.6 1.6 0 0 1 0 3.204m0-4.457a2.856 2.856 0 0 0 0 5.711 2.856 2.856 0 0 0 0-5.71\" fill=\"#343434\"></path><path d=\"M16.036 13.23c0 .682-.553 1.234-1.234 1.234H5.199a1.234 1.234 0 0 1-1.234-1.234V7.623c0-.639.518-1.157 1.157-1.157h2.315l.11-.46a1.578 1.578 0 0 1 1.536-1.22h1.837c.734 0 1.37.505 1.537 1.22l.106.46h2.315c.64 0 1.158.518 1.158 1.157v5.607zM10 0C4.478 0 0 4.477 0 10s4.478 10 10 10c5.523 0 10-4.477 10-10S15.523 0 10 0z\" fill=\"#000\"></path></g></svg></i></p><figcaption><span>The Breed 20 is a well configured aluminium gravel bike from Felt.</span></figcaption><p><span><i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></p></div></div></div><span>As you’d expect for the price, the Breed frame is aluminium rather than carbon, but it’s a fully-featured chassis with everything you’d want from a modern gravel bike. It’s a sharp looker too, thanks to dropped chainstays, smooth welds and a classy ‘satin velvet’ paint finish.</span><p><span>Felt claims this bike delivers “classic road bike manners”, but delving into the spec sheets it’s interesting to see how this bike’s geometry differs from some competitors.</span></p><p><span>Compared to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/canyon-grail-6-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canyon’s aluminium Grail</a>, for example, the Breed has a shorter wheelbase and reach figures for each given size but a significantly slacker head angle.</span></p><p><span>To complement the slack head angle, the Breed’s carbon fork has a longer than usual offset figure of 50mm. It’s the opposite of what Canyon is doing with the Grail’s steeper head angle and shorter fork offset.</span></p><div><h3>What is Bike of the Week?</h3><p>Every week, we bring you a detailed first look at one of the latest bikes (or framesets) to arrive at BikeRadar HQ – from road to commuting, gravel to enduro, and anything in between.</p><p>This is our chance to introduce the bike and everything that makes it unique before hitting the road or trails.</p><p>Head to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/\">Bike of the Week hub</a> for previous editions.</p></div><p><span>There are three bottle cage mounts within the front triangle and a fourth on the top tube for a bento box storage bag.</span></p><p><span>The frame will accept either <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b or 700c wheels</a>, but comes fitted with 700c Devox branded alloy rims with an internal diameter of 21mm.</span></p><p><span>The rims are fitted with tubeless-ready Vittoria Terreno Dry TNT 40mm tyres. </span><span>There’s clearance for up to 45mm tyres if you stick with 700c or the frame will officially accept up to 2.1in with 650b wheels fitted.</span></p><p><span>The bike is sold with the hardware to fit full-length <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> and is fully compatible with panniers thanks to concealed luggage mounts, including one particularly smart one that integrates with the rear seat clamp.</span></p><p><span>The Breed 20 is dressed in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">SRAM’s Force 1 groupset</a> – meaning taut, proven 1×11 shifting and excellent control from flat-mount hydraulic <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a>. </span><span>Rather than run the standard SRAM Force chainset, Felt has upgraded the Breed 20 with a Praxis Works Zayante Carbon-S 40t chainset.
