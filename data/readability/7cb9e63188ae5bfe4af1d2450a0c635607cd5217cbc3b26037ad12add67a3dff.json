Some ‌AirPods Max‌ headphones were seeing excessive battery drain while in the Smart Case, and now there's evidence that the update does indeed fix the problem.</p><p><img alt=\"airpods max firmware update\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/fu3bDFqzv-lOUHb0xthDcVkcO1A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/fu3bDFqzv-lOUHb0xthDcVkcO1A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/fu3bDFqzv-lOUHb0xthDcVkcO1A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/9fC46oE38RmwQ45IUjSc8_kcWas=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/-p6a7NyHiU9PUWJSfqMX0wBBqc8=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_5VSHOEPTaQo-fZyL0iXSQFSfGQ=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"748px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/fu3bDFqzv-lOUHb0xthDcVkcO1A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/9fC46oE38RmwQ45IUjSc8_kcWas=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/-p6a7NyHiU9PUWJSfqMX0wBBqc8=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_5VSHOEPTaQo-fZyL0iXSQFSfGQ=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg 2500w\"><br>Developer Guilherme Rambo tested ‌AirPods Max‌ battery drain before and after the firmware update to see how much battery life was being lost while the ‌AirPods Max‌ were in the Smart Case. Battery drain was measured in half hour intervals, and as the charts show, the ‌AirPods Max‌ lost more battery life in the Smart Case prior to the firmware update.</p><p>In addition to Rambo's testing, there are also <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-3c39-airpods-max-firmware.2287722/post-29678556\">anecdotal reports</a> on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums that suggest the ‌AirPods Max‌ are no longer losing large amounts of battery life in the case overnight. From <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/goto/post?id=29676277\">F23</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Updated yesterday. 24 hours later, they did NOT lose a single percent. Still at 97% after 24 hours in the case. On previous software version i would lose 10%+ overnight consistently.</p></blockquote><p>Other <em>MacRumors</em> readers have noted improvements to automatic switching when using the ‌AirPods Max‌, and a fix for a bug that could sometimes cause them to disconnect between devices.

Prior to the firmware update, ‌AirPods Max‌ would go into a low power mode when placed in the case, and an ultralow power mode after 18 hours. If this is the case, though, Apple has yet to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886\">update its support document</a> to reflect the charging changes.</p><p>There's no clear cut way to update firmware for the ‌AirPods Max‌ like there is for devices like the ‌iPhone‌, but connecting the ‌AirPods Max‌ to a power source and then listening to music for a few seconds to connect them to an ‌iPhone‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> typically forces the update.</p><p>You can check the firmware on your ‌AirPods Max‌ by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Connect your ‌‌AirPods Max‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><li>Open the Settings app.</li><li>Tap General.</li><li>Tap About.</li><li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>‌‌‌‌‌.</li><li>Look at the number next to \"Firmware Version.\"</li></ol><p>Have you noticed better battery life since upgrading to the 3C39 firmware?
