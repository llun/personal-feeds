Samsung benefited from a big reduction in spending by Huawei, which remained in third position, despite being down 23.5% from 2019.<br></p><blockquote><p>\"The U.S. government increased trade restrictions on Huawei in 2020, limiting its ability to purchase semiconductors, which, in turn, limited its smartphone supply and reduced its market share. However, the Chinese market remains important for semiconductor vendors, as other Chinese smartphone OEMs stepped in to fill the vacuum created by Huawei in the second half of 2020,\" said Yamaji.</p></blockquote><p>Among the top 10 companies, Xiaomi increased its spending the most (26%) in 2020, having been minimally impacted by the global health crisis thanks to its mainly online-driven sales model. Sanctions on Huawei also enabled Xiaomi to gain more market share in the smartphone market.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/14/heart-month-activity-challenge/\">Apple's Heart Month Activity Challenge Requires 60 Minutes of Exercise on Valentine's Day</a></h3><p>Saturday February 13, 2021 10:15 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/frank-mcshan/\" rel=\"author\">Frank McShan</a></p><p>Today only, Apple Watch owners can complete a new Apple Watch activity challenge in celebration of Heart Month, which is aimed at promoting cardiovascular health.
