There’s an early fourth-category climb, but this is a day for the fastmen.</p><p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> There’s a sharp right-hand turn just before 3 km to go … just where GC riders are jostling with lead-out trains in order to protect their GC time. That could be interesting. There’s also a right-hander just a few hundred metres before the finish line.</p><p><strong>Who’s it for:</strong> Sprinters.</p><p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks:</strong> <em>Mark Cavendish was already my favorite to win this stage even before Tim Merlier and Arnaud Démare left the race. Now he’ll have an even clearer path to victory. Nacer Bouhanni looks like his strongest rival at the moment, but Wout van Aert and Mads Pedersen could both get into the mix, and don’t rule out the likes of Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews in a tricky finish.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_PROFILS-ETAPES-SANS-RAVITO_ETP10-1340x660.jpeg\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_ET10_carte-1340x947.jpeg\"></figure></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"24071ae63f3a0a9e2290f1cd8f3b5f1d5ec8426bb4450a95a42e132e640fb82c","category":"Cycling"}
