Identify Gaps in the App Store and Fill Them</h3><p>The Shopify App Store is already full of apps that make merchants happy. So, there’s no reason to create something that has to compete with well-established and trusted solutions.</p><p>If you want to be successful in the App Store, you have to find new or missed opportunities to fill. But how exactly do you find the perfect app to develop for Shopify merchants?</p><p>To start, there are tons of researchers and organizations that release annual and sometimes quarterly “state of” reports. It’s a good idea to read through the most recent ones to get a sense for current e-commerce trends.</p><p>Go to Google and do a search for “state of e-commerce”, “e-commerce trends [year]” or “e-commerce predictions”.

Make Sure the App Loads Within a Couple Seconds Both Inside and Outside the Shopify Admin</h3><p>Every time a Shopify merchant connects a new app to their store, they run the risk of slowing down the loading speeds of the site. Even if the merchant appreciates the functionality or feature, their shoppers won’t be too happy when they have to wait 10 seconds for each page to fully load.</p><p>Consumers’ expectations are sky-high: they expect to be inside a working website (or app) within a couple of seconds. And it’s not just the front end of an e-commerce site they’ll grow impatient with if it takes too long to load.</p><p>Merchants also encounter slow-loading apps within the Shopify admin and POS. If your app sluggishly loads or won’t load at all, don’t expect them to patiently wait as you hamper their productivity.</p><p>If those aren’t enough reasons to encourage you to fix your app’s loading issues, think about it this way:</p><p>A slow-loading app is one you’re going to have to spend extra time troubleshooting as the negative reviews come pouring in and the number of uninstalls rises.</p><p>In addition to developing a lightweight app for performance’s sake, take a look at how it authenticates as well. Embedded apps — ones that integrate with Shopify’s UI — go through a series of authentication steps. This process sometimes gets bogged down because of cookies.</p><p>Cookies are necessary as they enable your app to recognize the Shopify merchant trying to access it. But if your app doesn’t have cookies stored, it has to turn to Shopify’s OAuth to get them. And this is where things slow down.</p><p>Shopify has a solution for this. Instead of using session cookies, you’ll use session tokens. This cuts out the OAuth step (with the exception of the initial installation of the app) and streamlines the process.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/embedded-apps\">Shopify shows us how useful this alternate implementation is</a>:</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d20b07b2-a3de-4deb-885d-e4b9e480e49c/embedded-apps-loading-flow.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"Shopify infographic: difference between session cookies through OAuth and session tokens with AppBridge\"></a><figcaption>A Shopify infographic that shows the difference between session cookies and session tokens.

Keep your paragraphs short so the information is delivered in easy-to-digest chunks.</p><p><strong>Third, choose one keyword to focus your App Store listing around.</strong> You can use <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/aw/keywordplanner/\">Google’s free keyword planner tool</a> to do your research.
