Rumors suggest the new iMacs will feature a design similar to the Pro Display XDR with slimmed down bezels and no metal chin.</p><p>Rather than a curved rear design, the new ‌iMac‌ models will feature a flat back, and at least one of the new models will measure in at 23 to 24 inches. Apple silicon chips will be included, and some dubious rumors have pointed toward <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/prosser-imac-colors-mac-pro-to-resemble-mac-minis/\">color options</a> that match the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> colors.</p><p>Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/\">discontinued the iMac Pro</a>, which was a high-end ‌iMac‌ option that was first released in 2017. With signs of the new iMacs in the current Big Sur beta and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac-pro/\">iMac Pro</a> discontinued and out of stock, we could see the refreshed ‌iMac‌ models in the not too distant future.</p><p>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/apple-stops-signing-ios-14-4-1/\">Apple Stops Signing iOS 14.4 Following Release of iOS 14.4.1</a></h3><p>Friday March 19, 2021 1:23 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Following the release of iOS 14.4.1 on March 8, Apple has stopped signing iOS 14.4, the previous version of iOS 14.
