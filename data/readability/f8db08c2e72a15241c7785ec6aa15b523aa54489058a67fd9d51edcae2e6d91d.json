Temps went from -34 to a balmy -8 in just a couple of days. Unfortunately I managed to break a rib about 5 minutes after taking this pic, no riding for a week or two…sigh.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
