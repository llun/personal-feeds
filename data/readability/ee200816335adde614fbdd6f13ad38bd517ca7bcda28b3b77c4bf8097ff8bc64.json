And like many of Wolf Tooth’s products, it offers a few unique features compared to what else is out there. </p><p>Firstly, it features flaps top and bottom that not only help to seal and protect the tools in transport but add functionality in use. The top flap can be closed in a car door to turn your vehicle into a tool wall, while the bottom flap is easily large and durable enough to be used as a standing mat while changing in a car park or as a makeshift workspace. And then there are aluminium eyelets in case you want to hang it up on nails at home. </p><p>The next unique feature is that most of the pockets feature clear vinyl panels that reveal what’s stashed within them. They’re generously sized, too, and I could store bulkier things like my <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/03/silca-t-ratchet-ti-torque-tool-kit-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Silca T-ratchet kit</a> and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/06/fumpa-and-minifumpa-electric-bicycle-pumps-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Fumpa electric pump</a> in them without issue. And if you run out of pockets there are small elastic loops for stashing extra tools, too. Notably missing are any zippered or otherwise sealed pockets, however, I haven’t suffered from any accidentally lost or dropped tools. </p><p>Overall the build quality is high with a mix of ripstop nylon and Cordura, while two large plastic buckles hold it all together for carrying. However, the durable material, myriad of pockets, and those handy top and bottom flaps all make for a roll that’s a little portly. </p><p>The 575 gram empty weight may not matter if you’re using this roll at home, races, or from the car, but I personally wanted a little less mass and an even more compact roll when packing for a recent flight. Speaking of that recent flight, the tools pictured are what I took on a recent mountain biking trip to Tasmania. You can see a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CMMeseTlhW6/\" target=\"_blank\">full breakdown of the tools I took, here</a>. It’s worth noting that’s there plenty of space spare for extra tools in addition to what I packed.</p><p>Wolf Tooth has clearly put some thought into this product and I found it easy to use and with a durable build – and I believe that’s all reflected in the price. This wrap isn’t big enough to house a full workshop of tools, but there’s certainly enough space to handle the common tools and spares you’ll need when away from home or during routine maintenance. </p><p><strong>Weight: </strong>575 grams (without tools)<br><strong>Price: </strong>US$50 / AU$94 (tools not included)<br><strong>More info:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/travel-tool-wrap\" target=\"_blank\">wolftoothcomponents.com</a></p><div><p><em>Follow the link to see previous products we’ve reviewed in our <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/spotlight/%E2%80%9D\" target=\"“_blank”\">Spotlight series</a>.</em></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ee200816335adde614fbdd6f13ad38bd517ca7bcda28b3b77c4bf8097ff8bc64","category":"Cycling"}
