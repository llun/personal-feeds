From the <a href=\"https://weatherlineapp.com/blog/weather-line-is-being-acquired\">Weather Line blog</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In recent months, we were approached by a buyer. They saw the uniqueness of Weather Line and the strong foundation we’ve built.

Today, we removed Weather Line from the ‌App Store‌. For all existing Weather Line users, free and paid, the app will continue working for 13 months, until April 1, 2022.</p></blockquote><p>The developers went on to emphasize that no personal user data, such as email addresses and payment information, was included in the acquisition deal, and there are no circumstances in which anyone will be billed again by the app.</p><p>Weather Line's smart infographic-focused design, streamlined forecast interface, and ‌Home Screen‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a> proved a hit with iOS users, so it will be interesting to see what comes of it in future.</p><p>Dark Sky, another popular third-party weather app, was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky/\">acquired</a> by Apple last year, but there's currently no suggestion that Apple is behind the Weather Line buyout.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/bill-gates-prefers-android-over-iphone/\">Bill Gates Says His Preference for Android Over iPhone is Due to Pre-Installed Software</a></h3><p>Friday February 26, 2021 3:35 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates this week participated in his first meeting on Clubhouse, the increasingly popular invite-only conversation app, where he fielded a range of questions as part of an ongoing book tour.
