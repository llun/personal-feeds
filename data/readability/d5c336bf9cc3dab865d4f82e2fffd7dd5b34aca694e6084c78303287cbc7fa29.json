Additionally, the agency pinpoints the release of iOS 11 as the start of the case.</p><p>According to the agency, Apple was aware that the update would \"have considerable impacts on ‌iPhone‌ performance.\" Yet, it still \"encouraged its users to update the devices.\" Those who did update their device were \"faced with a slow phone, with a weak performance and unexpected \"blackouts,\" according to the statement.</p><blockquote><p>Aware that it would cause slowness in devices, performance breaks, and unexpected blackouts, Apple encouraged ‌iPhone‌ 6, 6 Plus, 6S, or 6S Plus users to update their devices with the latest version of their operating system. In doing so, he knew they would prefer new iPhones, not other brands, given the high loyalty of their customers.</p></blockquote><p>Deco Proteste and Euroconsumer, a more extensive European consumer protection agency group, say they've been attempting to come to a resolution for consumers impacted by Apple's \"programmed obsolescence\" for the past three years, but have had no luck. Apple was forced to pay a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/italy-fining-apple-iphone-throttling/\">fine of 10 million euros</a> in Italy following an Italian consumer protection agency investigation. Deco Proteste says \"Portuguese consumers deserve the same treatment,\" hence its intent to move forward with the lawsuit.</p><p>As part of its push to encourage Portuguese consumers to join in their legal battle, Deco Proteste has produced a short video titled \"Some apples are spoiled ahead of time.\" The agency is also encouraging the use of the hashtag #stopobsolescenciaiiPhone6.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/bill-gates-prefers-android-over-iphone/\">Bill Gates Says His Preference for Android Over iPhone is Due to Pre-Installed Software</a></h3><p>Friday February 26, 2021 3:35 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates this week participated in his first meeting on Clubhouse, the increasingly popular invite-only conversation app, where he fielded a range of questions as part of an ongoing book tour.
