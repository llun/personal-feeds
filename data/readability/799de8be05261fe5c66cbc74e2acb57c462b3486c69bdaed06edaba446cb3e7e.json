Spiekermann is also a passionate cyclist who painted his first road bike at just 13. </p><p>The design on the Ultimate incorporates functional aspects of the bike into the artwork. This includes design notes, tube angles, torque specifications, and measurements in a bright blue, all on a dark metallic grey with satin-matte finish. Pretty nice if you ask me. </p><p>The custom artwork also extends to the wheels for a perfect match between frame and wheels.</p><p>The frame is built with a SRAM Force Etap AXS groupset, Canyon’s CP10 integrated carbon cockpit, Zipp 404 Firecrest wheels, and Continental GP5000 tyres.</p><p>Purchasers of the limited-edition bikes will also receive a brochure detailing the story behind the bike’s design, and each frame is hand-signed by Spiekermann. </p><p>The bike is the second in a series from Canyon celebrating artists who are passionate about cycling. This new design follows on from a sold-out limited edition <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/road-bikes/race-bikes/ultimate/ultimate-cf-slx-8-disc-ltd-i/2765.html?dwvar_2765_pv_rahmenfarbe=BK%2FMC\" target=\"_blank\">Ultimate CF SLX designed by photographer Tino Pohlmann</a>. </p><p>While the limited-edition colourway may or may not be your cup of tea, it is currently the only Ultimate available as all other models are listed as out of stock on Canyon’s website. Don’t expect that to last long, though, as the Erik Spiekermann Canyon Ultimate is limited to just 50 bikes.</p><p>The bike is available now (at the time of writing at least) at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/road-bikes/race-bikes/ultimate/?hideSelectedFilters=true&amp;prefn1=pc_plattform&amp;prefv1=Ultimate+CF+SLX%7CUltimate+CF+SLX+Disc&amp;srule=recommended\">Canyon.com</a>, retailing for £6,499.  </p><figure><p></p></figure></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"799de8be05261fe5c66cbc74e2acb57c462b3486c69bdaed06edaba446cb3e7e","category":"Cycling"}
