href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev.html\" title=\"\">Robinhood</a>, the online trading app, said on Thursday that it was raising an infusion of more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/business/robinhood-gamestop-trading.html\" title=\"\">$1 billion</a> from its existing investors.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/30/business/robinhood-wall-street-gamestop.html\" title=\"\">Robinhood</a>, one of the largest online brokerages, has grappled with an extraordinarily high volume of trading this week as individual investors have piled into stocks like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/business/gamestop-robinhood.html\" title=\"\">GameStop</a>. That activity has put a strain on Robinhood, which has to pay customers who are owed money from trades while posting additional cash to its clearing facility to insulate its trading partners from potential losses.</p><p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/business/gamestop-robinhood.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">Robinhood was forced to stop customers</a> from buying a number of stocks, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/gamestop-wall-street-bets.html\" title=\"\">GameStop</a>, that were heavily traded this week. To continue operating, it drew on a line of credit from six banks amounting to between $500 million and $600 million to meet higher margin, or lending, requirements from its central clearing facility for stock trades, known as the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation.</p><p>Robinhood still needed more cash quickly to ensure that it didn’t have to place further limits on customer trading, said two people briefed on the situation, who asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were confidential.</p></div><div><p>Robinhood, which is privately held, contacted several of its investors, including the venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital, which came together on Thursday night to offer the emergency funding, five people involved in the negotiations said.</p><p>“This is a strong sign of confidence from investors that will help us continue to further serve our customers,” Josh Drobnyk, a Robinhood spokesman, said in an email. Sequoia and Ribbit declined to comment.</p><p>Investors who provide new financing to Robinhood will receive additional equity in the company. The investors will get that equity at a discounted valuation tied to the price of Robinhood shares when the company goes public, two of the people said. Robinhood plans to hold an initial public offering this year, two people briefed on the plans said.</p><p>Robinhood’s emergency fund-raising is the latest sign of how trading in the stock market has been upended this week.</p><p>An online army of investors, who have been on a mission to challenge the dominance of Wall Street, rapidly bid up the price of stocks like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html\" title=\"\">GameStop</a>, entrapping the big-money hedge funds that had bet against the stocks. Some of these individual investors have reaped huge profits, while at least one major hedge fund had to be bailed out after facing huge losses.</p></div><div><p>Robinhood, which is based in Silicon Valley, has been key to empowering the online investors. Adoption of the app has soared in the pandemic as the stock market surged and people took up day trading in the void of other pastimes. The company has drawn in millions of young investors who had never traded before by offering no-fee trading and an app that critics have said makes buying stocks feel like an online game.</p><p>Without fees, Robinhood makes money by passing its customer trades along to bigger brokerage firms, like Citadel, which pay Robinhood for the chance to fulfill its customer stock orders.</p><p>In May, Robinhood said it had 13 million users. This week, it became the most-downloaded free app in Apple’s App Store, <a href=\"https://apptopia.com/store-insights/top-charts/itunes-connect/top-overall/united-states\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to Apptopia</a>, a data provider.</p><p>Critics have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html\" title=\"\">accused</a> the company of encouraging people to gamble on stock market movements and risk big losses. Brokerages including T. Rowe Price, Schwab and Fidelity have imitated Robinhood by lowering their trading fees to zero. Many of them were also hit by the crush of trading this week.</p><p>Robinhood has had no trouble raising money over the last year, drawing $1.3 billion in venture capital backing and lifting its valuation to nearly $12 billion. Its other investors include the venture capital firm DST Capital, New Enterprise Associates, Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>Yet the company has faced many issues, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/business/robinhood-sec-charges.html\" title=\"\">fines from regulators</a> for misleading customers. In March, it raised more money after<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/technology/trading-app-robinhood-outage.html\" title=\"\"> its app went down</a> and left customers stranded and nursing big losses, leading to a still ongoing lawsuit.</p><p>In recent weeks, many online investors have used Robinhood to make bets that pushed up the price of GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks that had been widely shorted — or bet against — by hedge funds. That changed on Thursday after the company curbed customer trading in the most popular stocks.</p></div><div><p>“As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements,” Robinhood said in a blog <a href=\"https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> Thursday. “Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment.”</p><p>In protest, hundreds of thousands of users <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">joined a campaign</a> to give Robinhood’s app the lowest one-star review and drive the company’s rating down. Some investors also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sued Robinhood</a> for the losses they sustained after the company cut off trading in certain stocks and several lawmakers urged regulators to exercise more scrutiny of the company.</p></div></section></article></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"152b60e67b5fc905febdaf1b850b314c9a6f82297e1c1ae497ce79f05a59cd1e","category":"Tech"}
