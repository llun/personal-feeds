It's possible that Facebook is changing its narrative as it has become clear that Apple has no plans to delay the implementation of App Tracking Transparency, and Facebook's attempts to stop it gave gained little steam.</p><p>With the launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-releases-ios-14-5-beta-1-to-developers/\">of iOS 14.5</a>, apps like Facebook will have to get express user permission before accessing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s advertising identifier or IDFA, which is used to track usage across apps and websites for ad targeting purposes.</p><p>Facebook has railed against Apple's planned privacy updates, taking out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/\">full page newspaper ads</a> that aimed to position Apple as the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/apple-ios-14-speak-up-for-small-business\">enemy of small businesses</a>. Facebook has claimed that businesses that use Facebook's advertising tools will suffer because they won't be able to target ads as effectively as they can now, but there are questions about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/facebook-employees-app-tracking-transparency/\">how much data</a> small businesses need to get their ads in front of the right customers.</p><p>App Tracking Transparency will impact Facebook's view-through conversion tracking, which lets ad companies determine how many people saw an ad and didn't click it, but later made a purchase related to the ad. The IDFA allows Facebook to match up those who buy an item with those who saw an ad, but without the IDFA, advertisers will not be able to accurately measure the effectiveness of Facebook and Instagram ads.</p><p>According to <em>CNBC</em>, Facebook has been preparing for App Tracking Transparency with the introduction of Facebook Shops and Instagram Shops, where brands can list and sell items directly on the social networks. Zuckerberg said that more than 250 million people are actively using the shops feature.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad/\">Apple Shares 'Jump' AirPods Pro Ad</a></h3><p>Sunday March 14, 2021 9:09 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple today shared a new AirPods Pro-focused ad called \"Jump\" on its YouTube channel, highlighting the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency features of the earbuds in a creative way.
