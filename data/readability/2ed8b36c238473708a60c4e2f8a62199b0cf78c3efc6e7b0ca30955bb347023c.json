The data from IDC (<a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/chromebooks-outsold-macs-worldwide-2020-cutting-windows-market-share/\">via GeekWire</a>) shows that Windows continues to dominate the market, although its share declined over the course of the year as Chrome OS surged past macOS into second place.</p><p>For the full year, the market share of Windows was down 4.9% in 2020 compared to 2019, while the Mac grew from 6.7% to 7.5%. IDC's data includes collective information about desktops, laptops, and workstations, and doesn't provide a breakdown of specific different product types. It is worth noting, however, that Chrome OS includes products made by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo.</p><p><img alt=\"marketshare\" width=\"613\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/P5FLVG2iCU329pgnN10u9SHuQxc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/P5FLVG2iCU329pgnN10u9SHuQxc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/P5FLVG2iCU329pgnN10u9SHuQxc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/cDMn9vAFLNFsEz7i6wu-Se0EZPE=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/rIpGfUaV4WA75CpZ1_FLMyZ7_mE=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2PGK_qDqOQ4T_T2EfokGwZS2k4Y=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"613px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/P5FLVG2iCU329pgnN10u9SHuQxc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/cDMn9vAFLNFsEz7i6wu-Se0EZPE=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/rIpGfUaV4WA75CpZ1_FLMyZ7_mE=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2PGK_qDqOQ4T_T2EfokGwZS2k4Y=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/marketshare.png 2500w\"></p><p>Demand for personal computers skyrocketed during 2020, largely thanks to the shift to working and learning at home. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/mac-shipments-up-4q-2020-gartner/\">Market data estimates</a> that in Q4 of 2020, the Mac grew by around 30% compared to the same quarter the previous year.
