The iconic ‘brand with three stripes’ has further expanded into the cycling market this time by releasing its iconic Samba trainer as an SPD cycling shoe.</p><p>That’s right, you can now buy a pair of Adidas Samba trainers that clip into your cycling pedals. Knocking the Shimano sandal from its ‘cool SPD shoe’ throne, the Velosamba hopes ‘to meet the needs of a young and burgeoning generation of cyclists that are building a creative, diverse and city-based cycling culture’ by using one of the brand’s most popular existing trainers.</p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.adidas.co.uk/the-velosamba-cycling-shoes/FW4459.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Adidas Velosamba trainers now for £100</a></strong></em></p><p>If you are unaware, the Samba is undeniably among the German sportswear brand’s most famous trainer designs. In fact, behind the Stan Smith, it is the best-selling Adidas trainer of all time with over 35 million pairs sold worldwide.</p><p>A trainer originally knocked up in 1949, it centred around a unique gum sole that was designed for footballers wanting to play on icy, hard grounds in the winter. From there it became the shoe of choice for millions of indoor football players and 1990 Britpop obsessives worldwide. And lest we not forget Ewan McGregor pegging it down Princes Street in a pair.<a href=\"https://www.adidas.co.uk/the-velosamba-cycling-shoes/FW4459.html\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p>The Velosamba is very much cut from the same cloth as the original Samba, borrowing the same casual silhouette throughout the shoe’s upper. However, a series of changes have been made to make this suitable for cycling.</p><p>Firstly, the obvious change was the cut-out window within the gumsole that houses the plate for a two-bolt SPD cleat. Recessed into the sole, this also allows cyclists to walk around in the shoes without any issues too.</p><p>Adidas has also incorporated a nylon insole board for extra stiffness when clipped into the pedals that have just enough flex to allow off-the-bike travel. Lastly, to aid night riding, all designs of the Velosamba will have reflective stripes and heel cups for better visibility for fellow road traffic.</p><p>‘The launch of Velosamba is another step on our journey towards creating a range of products that enhance the cycling experience and which play a part in changing the way that cities move for the better,’ said Celine Del Genes, general manager of specialist sports at Adidas.</p><p>‘Following the launch of The Road Shoe which represented our return to road cycling footwear, the Velosamba draws on our street style heritage and expertise in cycling to bring something truly unique to cyclists.</p><p>‘Our ambition is to cater to the needs of a rapidly developing new cycling culture by creating accessible high-quality products that empower more people to clip in and ride.’</p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.adidas.co.uk/the-velosamba-cycling-shoes/FW4459.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Adidas Velosamba trainers now for £100</a></strong></em></p><p>To kick off the range, the Velosamba will come in four colours: black &amp; white, off-white &amp; white, flouro yellow &amp; white and navy on navy. They will come in all sizes from 3.5 to 13 and cost £100.
