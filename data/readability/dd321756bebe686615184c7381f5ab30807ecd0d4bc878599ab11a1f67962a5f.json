Alongside Gmail, Google Meet, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Calander, and Google Tasks have also received app updates today, with Google Tasks adding new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>.</p><p>As with nearly all Google apps on the ‌App Store‌, Gmail had remained without a proper app update for months. Initial <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/google-ios-apps-still-no-privacy-labels/\">speculation</a> was that Google was holding back app updates as a way to delay having to disclose to users its privacy practices. Updates for Google's more popular apps have started rolling out over the past few weeks, and Gmail is certainly one of the most high-profile ones to finally see an update.</p><p>Announced at WWDC 2020 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/app-store-privacy-labels-ios-14-3/\">rolled out</a> officially in December, Apple's privacy \"nutrition labels\" require developers to provide users detailed information about what data they collect and whether they share that data with third parties. As of early December, developers must provide this privacy information before a new or updated app can be made available on the ‌App Store‌.</p><p>Google updated Gmail with privacy labels <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/\">just over a week ago</a>, but the app itself was not updated until today.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/bill-gates-prefers-android-over-iphone/\">Bill Gates Says His Preference for Android Over iPhone is Due to Pre-Installed Software</a></h3><p>Friday February 26, 2021 3:35 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates this week participated in his first meeting on Clubhouse, the increasingly popular invite-only conversation app, where he fielded a range of questions as part of an ongoing book tour.
