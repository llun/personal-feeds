First and foremost, thank you to everyone that has supported the app over the years. We never could have imagined how far it would go. Weather Line has had a fantastic journey as an indie app, and we are grateful to all of you for that.</p><p>In recent months, we were approached by a buyer. They saw the uniqueness of Weather Line and the strong foundation we’ve built. While we aren’t able to provide further details on their future plans for the app, we hope you can understand, and will look forward to it.</p><p>The acquisition means the app is going away. Today, we removed Weather Line from the App Store. <strong>For all existing Weather Line users, free and paid, the app will continue working for 13 months, until April 1, 2022.</strong></p><p><strong>As a thank you, we’ve extended all active SuperCharge subscriptions for free until the app shuts down.</strong> You do not need to take any actions to redeem this, and there are no circumstances where anyone will be billed again by Weather Line.</p><p>For non-paying users – nothing changes. You can continue using those features for free.</p><p><strong>Rest assured that no user data, email addresses, payment information, or any other sensitive data was transferred to Weather Line’s new owners.</strong> This data has not and will not be sold.</p><p>As an Indie Founder without a day job, being able to sell an app provides for my family in a very difficult climate. There’s a poster on my wall that says, “Make something people want.” While this marks the closing of one chapter, I am humbled and honored to have been able to create something people want. Your support and belief over the last nine years has helped me accomplish that, and I’m so incredibly blessed and thankful.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Ryan and Kevin</p></div></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1570ea9bafbf4fa9d39b519eb2f95eff77b4dbf4dfb46043739b378feaa5fc27","category":"Tech"}
