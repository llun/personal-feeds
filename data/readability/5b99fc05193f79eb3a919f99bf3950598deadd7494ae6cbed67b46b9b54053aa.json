It read:</p><blockquote><p>Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future. Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.</p></blockquote><p>The phrasing implies that Carano's relationship with Disney and Lucasfilm may have ended before her most recent high-profile post on social media: an Instagram \"story\" quoting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djarinculture/status/1359547709900922884\">an anti-mask podcast's post</a> that compared Nazi \"rounding up\" of Jews during the Holocaust to \"hating someone for their political views.\" The same post, from this Tuesday evening, implied that Jews were somehow more subject to violence by \"neighbors\" than by Nazis—without citing a nation, era, or other clarification about the point being made.</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-mandalorian-star-gina-carano-fired-amid-social-media-controversy\">quoted</a> \"a source with knowledge of Lucasfilm’s thinking,\" who said that Lucasfilm and Disney execs had been \"looking for a reason to fire [Carano] for two months, and today was the final straw.\" In recent months, the former MMA athlete and <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> actor had doubled down on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ginacarano/status/1327806477923323904\">anti-mask messaging</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ginacarano/status/1324385598539399168\">casting doubt on the presidential election</a>. As it turns out, according to THR's \"sources,\" these November posts moved Disney to pivot from their previous plans of announcing Carano as the star of her own <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/disney-espn-hulu-bundle-will-land-in-november-for-12-99month/\">Disney+</a> TV series. (This Carano-series news had previously not been reported until today.)</p><p>Her history with social media controversy went back further than November, however. In August, Carano posted an picture of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ginacarano/status/1290023168975835137\">Nazi soldiers in a crowd, with a single non-saluting Nazi circled and not otherwise captioned</a>. She followed this in September with <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/star-wars-mandalorian-gina-carano-trans-pronouns-bio-twitter-disney-b436015.html\">a change in her social media profile to read \"Beep/bop/boop\"</a>—an apparent response to fans asking her to list pronouns as an act of allyship with the trans community. Carano spent Wednesday doubling down on this reputation for controversial social media messaging, going so far as to post a take on the \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" meme, among other posts.</p><p>Carano or no, Disney+ appears to have no shortage of new Star Wars-related content to lean on for the foreseeable future, between <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/ewan-mcgregor-confirms-he-will-return-as-obi-wan-for-new-star-wars-series/\">an Obi-Wan series starring Ewan McGregor</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disney-sets-new-mandalorian-spinoff\">three <em>Mandalorian</em>-related series</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b99fc05193f79eb3a919f99bf3950598deadd7494ae6cbed67b46b9b54053aa","category":"Tech"}
