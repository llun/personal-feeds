Of course we wish it would have come about another way. But with so little to celebrate about 2020, cyclists, runners and pedestrians everywhere can find some hope in seeing how rapidly the world is changing its mind about active travel.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Email-Hero-190413_bikerun_0022@2x-800x438.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Email-Hero-190413_bikerun_0022@2x-800x438.png 800w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Email-Hero-190413_bikerun_0022@2x-768x420.png 768w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Email-Hero-190413_bikerun_0022@2x-1000x547.png 1000w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Email-Hero-190413_bikerun_0022@2x-1170x640.png 1170w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Email-Hero-190413_bikerun_0022@2x.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p><p><span>The vast majority of cities are experiencing a boom in human-powered transportation. Vehicle traffic has plummeted, while bike sales have soared. Urban planners, now with empty streets and far less demand for parking, have inspiringly blank canvases. And an influx of new cyclists and pedestrians –&nbsp;many just everyday people thirsting to get off of conference calls and feel some wind in their hair – is giving those planners more permission than ever before to build safe, efficient and enjoyable ways to move around by bike or on foot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-City-%E2%80%93-Trips-%E2%80%93-4_5-667x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"667\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-City-%E2%80%93-Trips-%E2%80%93-4_5-667x534.jpg 667w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-City-%E2%80%93-Trips-%E2%80%93-4_5-768x615.jpg 768w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-City-%E2%80%93-Trips-%E2%80%93-4_5-833x667.jpg 833w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-City-%E2%80%93-Trips-%E2%80%93-4_5-799x640.jpg 799w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-York-City-%E2%80%93-Trips-%E2%80%93-4_5-1463x1172.jpg 1463w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px\"></span></p><p><span>The global demand for better active travel that we thought would eventually arrive years from now is suddenly here, banging at the door. And it could become “the new normal” after the pandemic ends – but only if those who are able to contribute rise to the occasion. Thanks to the generosity of our community in continuing to share their activities with us, Strava can, so we will.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Metro is a powerful tool for helping urban planners, city governments and safe-infrastructure advocates understand mobility patterns, identify opportunities for investment and evaluate the impact of infrastructure changes. While the potential of Metro is enormous, its impact can only be as large as the number of partner organizations that can access and utilize it. In the past, challenges around data complexity and cost hindered Metro from aiding those who could benefit from it most. 2020 has taught us that we need to remove those hurdles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1_JQX_wHeD6tI3R0b3l99jHA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1164\" srcset=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1_JQX_wHeD6tI3R0b3l99jHA.png 2160w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1_JQX_wHeD6tI3R0b3l99jHA-800x431.png 800w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1_JQX_wHeD6tI3R0b3l99jHA-768x414.png 768w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1_JQX_wHeD6tI3R0b3l99jHA-1000x539.png 1000w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1_JQX_wHeD6tI3R0b3l99jHA-1188x640.png 1188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px\"></p><p><span>So starting today, Metro is free to qualified organizations around the world who are working to improve human-powered transportation.
