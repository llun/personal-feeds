{"title":"4iiii wants to buy your old left crank and recycle it as a power meter","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/4iiii-shimano-crank-buyback-program/","date":1619142720000,"content":"<div><div><p>Landing on Earth Day (April 22), power meter company 4iiii has introduced a new buyback policy focussed on recycling left-side Shimano road crank arms. </p><p>Currently limited to those in North America, 4iiii’s new buyback policy is offering between US$30-US$45 for your used (and hopefully currently unused) Shimano 105 (5800 and 7000 series), Ultegra (6800 and 8000 series), or Dura-Ace (9000 and 9100 series) left-side crank arm. Cranks with minor scratches and scuffs are being accepted. </p><p>The company plans to clean, test and then install a 4iiii power meter on the crank to then resell it as a refurbished left-hand power meter.   </p><p>Those who meet the buyback criteria will be given a postage-paid label to get the crank back to 4iiii’s headquarters. Upon receiving the crank, the Canadian-based company will then pay you cash (via PayPal) or donate to your selected charity. </p><p>Of course, repurposing used products is an environmentally responsible initiative, and we applaud 4iiii for the effort. However it’s also impossible to ignore the supply issues that likely played a huge role in the creation of this buyback program. When the world’s largest bike companies are struggling to even get chains, you can bet a company like 4iiii is currently cruising along Struggle Street in sourcing the bread for its butter. </p><p>You can find more information at <a href=\"https://4iiii.com/crank-buyback/#seemore\" target=\"_blank\">4iiii.com</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f595ef3d85859d41493ce098e9d292feedddd6c37d3720f13fbf958ec2dcdf4b","category":"Cycling"}
