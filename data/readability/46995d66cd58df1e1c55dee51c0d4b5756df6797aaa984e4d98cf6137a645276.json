From a timing perspective, we believe the current iPhone 13 launch is slated for the third week in September as of now but could push out into early October based on continued product model tweaks.</p></blockquote><p>Apple typically announces new iPhones in September, but the entire iPhone 12 lineup was unveiled in October last year, almost certainly due to production-related delays arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the supply chain now in better shape, it wouldn't be too surprising to see Apple revert to a September announcement.</p><p>Ives also continues to claim that the iPhone 13 lineup <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/wedbush-iphone-13-1tb-storage-lidar/\">could feature a new 1TB storage option</a> and a LiDAR Scanner across all four models, although TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the two Pro models</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/handy-iphone-shortcuts/\">Handy iPhone and iPad Shortcuts You Should Check Out</a></h3><p>Friday March 19, 2021 12:31 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>With the launch of iOS 13, Apple introduced Shortcuts support and the Shortcuts app, adding a whole range of new functionality to the iPhone.
