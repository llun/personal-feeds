Started by some former Faraday Future people, the company broke cover in 2019 with a subscription-only electric van that was built on a low-profile skateboard chassis. In December of 2020, after some management changes, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public\">Canoo showed off a delivery van</a> using that same platform and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-to-go-public-via-spac/\">then went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company</a>. Later today, the company was going to reveal a third EV—the adorable pickup you see in the gallery above—but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/\">someone leaked the images on Reddit</a> a day early.</p><p>The pickup certainly looks striking. If it bears resemblance to anything else on the road, it's probably <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/a-beginners-guide-to-the-world-of-weird-and-wonderful-japanese-import-cars/\">one of those Japanese microvans</a>, although the Canoo pickup is a regular-sized vehicle at 184-inches (4,677 mm) long and 78-inches (1,980 mm) wide.</p><p>Like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/these-are-the-best-new-vehicles-of-the-2019-new-york-international-auto-show/\">Rivian's forthcoming R1T</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/bollinger-reveals-four-door-b1-electric-suv-and-b2-electric-pickup/\">Bollinger's B2</a>, the Canoo pickup demonstrates the advantage of electric powertrains when it comes to packaging. Canoo's skateboard platform is particularly low-slung, which allows for a very <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab_forward\">cab-forward</a> design. There is cargo storage built into the nose of the truck, as well as storage bins on the side that also function as steps, similar to those we've seen from Rivian.</p><p>Canoo says the pickup is \"designed to be exponentially more productive,\" whether that's for people who need a work truck or something to go adventuring in. For the former, the fold-out worktables built into the nose and side of the bed should come in pretty handy, as will the multiple AC power points. There's an extending section to the pickup bed, which allows it to carry a 4-foot by 8-foot load, and there are modular dividers for the bed as well. The company also says the pickup has been designed to accommodate \"a variety of camper shells.\"</p><p>The pickup won't go into production until 2023, so it's too early to have full specs, but Canoo says that the vehicle should be available in rear- or all-wheel drive, with up to 600 hp (447 kW) and a range of at least 200 miles (321 km). There's no word on price, either, but Canoo has said that a base model of the delivery van should cost $33,000, so the pickup might end up being relatively affordable.</p><p><em>Listing image by Canoo</em></p></div></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
