Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn is now \"Master of Coin.\" The two men will retain their previous titles, the brief regulatory filing states.</p><p>The \"Master of Coin\" title may be a reference to Tesla's recent foray into cryptocurrencies. Tesla <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/tesla-buys-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-sending-its-price-soaring/\">announced in February</a> that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Tesla also said it was planning to accept bitcoin for its products \"in the near future.\" The announcement pushed bitcoin's value up to record highs.</p><p>Musk has a long history of attention-grabbing stunts. Around the same time as Tesla's bitcoin purchase, Musk touted the joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin, contributing to a tenfold increase in Dogecoin's value.</p><p>“Occasionally I make jokes about Dogecoin, but they are really meant to be jokes,\" Musk <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/elon-musk-speaks-out-on-bitcoin-and-reveals-why-he-tweets-about-dogecoin\">said</a> during a recent Clubhouse interview.</p><p>In 2018, Musk announced that his Boring Company would sell branded flamethrowers. Fans <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/elon-musk-is-selling-a-boring-company-flamethrower-because-why-not/\">snapped up 10,000 of them</a> in 48 hours.</p><p>Last year, Tesla <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/elon-musk-taunts-tesla-critics-as-stock-soars-to-new-highs/\">sold red \"short shorts\"</a> with \"S3XY\" printed in gold across the back. The sale was a way of taunting short sellers—people who bet on a fall in Tesla's stock price—at a time when the company's stock was soaring.</p><p>Tesla's stock rose tenfold—from $88 to $880—between January 2020 and January 2021. But it has been on a downward slide over the last month. The stock is up nearly 2 percent in early trading today. Presumably, Wall Street is excited about Musk's new role as Technoking.</p></div></div>","author":"Timothy B.
