If an image is chosen to self-destruct, the receiver will have a one-time chance to view it and not be able to save or export the image to their device.</p><p>WABetaInfo says that WhatsApp has not implemented screenshot detection, which would alert the sender if a screenshot of the self-destructing photo was taken. WhatsApp's approach to the feature is similar to Instagram Direct stories, in which case an image or video is only viewable once before it expires. Other popular messaging apps such as Telegram have already included self-destructing images for some time.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-lawsuit-programmed-obsolescence-portugal/\">Apple Faces Another iPhone Lawsuit Over 'Programmed Obsolescence'</a></h3><p>Monday March 1, 2021 6:44 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/sami-fathi/\" rel=\"author\">Sami Fathi</a></p><p>Apple faces a new class-action lawsuit that accuses it of deliberately releasing iOS updates that slowly reduce the performance of an iPhone, forcing customers to upgrade their devices.
