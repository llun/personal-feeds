Nearly half of survey respondents also said that fuel economy is very important when considering a vehicle to buy or lease, and 27 percent were very worried about car exhaust contributing to climate change.</p><p>Consequently, Consumer Reports will now grade cars according to their environmental impact. It has launched a new \"green choice\" rating, identified by a green leaf icon, to help people quickly identify vehicles with the best fuel efficiency and lowest contributions to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels and smog formation.</p><p>Interestingly, the survey also shows that nearly half of car buyers will use information about a vehicle's emissions to inform their buying—but only if they know where to look. Unfortunately, more than 50 percent are unaware that&nbsp;this information is displayed prominently on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroney_sticker\">the Monroney sticker</a>.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/monroney_4.png\" data-height=\"3300\" data-width=\"5100\" alt=\"This is what a Monroney window sticker looks like.

And four of the top 10 vehicles it recommends—known as Top Picks—are green choices: Toyota's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/the-2020-toyota-prius-prime-plug-in-proves-competent-and-calming/\">Prius</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/the-2020-toyota-corolla-hybrid-isnt-exciting-but-it-is-quite-frugal/\">Corolla</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/02/it-will-be-a-best-seller-but-is-it-any-good-the-2018-toyota-camry/\">Camry</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/the-tesla-model-3-reviewed-finally/\">Tesla Model 3</a>.</p><p>\"For a long time, we’ve included fuel efficiency in our road-test score for vehicles, but until now we haven't looked at what's coming out of the tailpipe. Green Choice will make the vehicles with the lowest greenhouse gas and smog-forming emissions readily apparent to consumers,\" said Jake Fisher, senior director of automotive testing and consumer reports.</p></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
