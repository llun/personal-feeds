Harper, is now headed to the Governor’s desk to be signed into law.</p><p>On February 19, the Utah House of Representatives <a href=\"https://www.xbiz.com/news/257507/utah-house-passes-controversial-porn-filter-bill-overnight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passed</a> an amended version of the controversial bill that would mandate a default “porn filter” on any phones, computers, tablets or any other electronic devices sold in the state starting in 2022.</p><p>HB 72, sponsored by Rep. Susan Pulsipher (R-South Jordan) — a realtor with no technology experience — was speedily passed by the House only hours after it had cleared the committee stage by the narrowest of margins (a 6-5 vote).</p><p>Members of Utah trade associations, tech company lobbies and free speech groups all advocated against HB 72.</p><p>If passed, the mandatory filters — from which for-profit, faith-based software companies have been profiting for some time — would have to be activated by default in 2022 if certain additional conditions, attached to the bill as an amendment, are met.</p><p>According to analysts, international manufacturers of phones and computers like Apple or Google could face civil liability if they don't comply.</p><p><em>Main Image: Utah State Representative Susan Pulsipher (R-South Jordan).
