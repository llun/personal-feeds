You’ll also be able to use two Roams as a stereo pair, The Verge says.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Sonos just sent out an invite for a “special event” on March 9, during which the company plans on showing off “the latest addition to the Sonos system.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The invite doesn’t go into any further detail about what the product might be, although an attached image shows someone taking an outdoor stroll with a small sling bag, so we’re guessing the new Sonos device will be something portable.</p><div><p><img onclick=\"jwplayer('bottomRightPlayer').remove(); this.style.display = 'none';\" id=\"jw-standalone-close-button\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"></p></div><p dir=\"ltr\">That adds fuel to the fire about a possible smaller version of the <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3439397/sonos-move-review.html\">Sonos Move</a>, a portable—or shall we say luggable—speaker that Sonos announced back in the fall of 2019.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Chatter about a new, smaller Move was sparked by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">a Sonos FCC filing</a> that describes a Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled speaker with a charging dock. The speaker also has power requirements that are somewhat less demanding than the hefty Move, which would seem to indicate that the device’s shell will be smaller.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, a smaller Move speaker isn’t the only thing Sonos might have up its sleeves. There’s also been plenty of rumors about a pair of Sonos headphones, and a recently unearthed filing from the German Patent and Trademark Office details a set of over-ear cans with a prominent Sonos logo.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The German patent filing also says that the headphones would come with a USB-C port, “various” buttons, and a 3.5mm input jack, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Verge reports</a>.</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by TechHive's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, we’re not necessarily talking about an “either/or” situation here. During Sonos’ earnings call last week, <a href=\"https://www.the-ambient.com/news/new-sonos-speaker-landing-next-month-ceo-spills-the-beans-2536\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Patrick Spence said</a> that the company is “committed to launching at least two new products per year,” so it’s possible that Sonos could unveil a portable speaker next month and then headphones later in 2021.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In any event, we’ll be covering Sonos’ event on March 9, so stay tuned.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
