They say they’re also eco-friendly, utilizing longer-lasting materials that reduce rubber waste.</p><h2>What is this magic material?</h2><p>SMART says the material (called NiTinol+) can expand, contract, bend, and unbend very quickly, like rubber. Even with extreme deformation, it will bounce back to its exact original shape through “phase transitions at the molecular level”. Like Iron Man’s nano tech suit, perhaps.</p><p>The material has a gold/silver/metallic blue finish and is “elastic like rubber yet strong like titanium” with perfect shape memory.</p><p>That shape memory comes from blending titanium with a Martensite steel material. The name, METL, stands for <em>Martensite Elasticized Tubular Loading.</em> Here’s they’re description:</p><p><em>“Martensite is a very hard form of steel crystalline structure. When a shape memory alloy is in martensite form at lower temperatures, the metal can easily be deformed into any shape. When heat-treated a certain way, the martensite reverts to austenite, and the material recovers its original shape, giving it super-elastic properties.”</em></p><p>Check the video at the bottom of this post for a much deeper dive on how that actually works…it’s fascinating!</p><h2>Could metal bicycle tires work?</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail.jpg\" alt=\"smart metl memory metal bicycle tires using nasa technology\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1232\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-297x244.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-800x657.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-120x99.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-768x631.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-696x572.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-1068x877.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-511x420.jpg 511w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-297x244.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-800x657.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-120x99.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-768x631.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-696x572.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-1068x877.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202224/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-detail-511x420.jpg 511w\"></a></p><p>Well, the big question is grip, and we’ll get to that. But first, let’s lay out the benefits.</p><p>METL’s alloy, shapeshifting tires <em>could</em> be lighter. Weight going onto a spacecraft is at a premium, costing six figures per ounce, so the material has to be incredibly light. And this one is, especially from a strength-to-weight ratio perspective.</p><p>It won’t need a tube, or sealant, and will never go flat, either. This, along with the material’s properties, means it can deform rapidly to match the terrain perfectly, allowing for better traction.</p><h3>OK, so how does it grip?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike.jpg\" alt=\"felt aero road bike with smart metl shapeshifting memory metal bicycle tires installed\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1002\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-1068x713.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-629x420.jpg 629w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-1068x713.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16202236/smart-metl-alloy-bicycle-tire-prototype-on-a-bike-629x420.jpg 629w\"></a></p><p>The metal will be coated in a new “rubber-like material” called Polyurethanium, which was co-developed with Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (<em>not Goodyear bicycle tires, which is totally separate</em>). They say the material offers extremely long-lasting tread and grip in all weather conditions.</p><p>Indeed, they’re claiming this is a life-of-the-bike tire that shouldn’t ever need replacing. The grip might, though, so they’ll offer a retreading service. And should you damage the structure underneath, they can likely repair it. If not, it can be recycled.</p><p>The Polyurethanium will feel kind of like a rubber material, and will actually coat the metal mesh so it’ll look more like a regular tire…and won’t let debris get inside. However, the metal lattice underneath handles all of the load bearing. The material over it is purely for protection and grip, so there’s no need for thick sidewalls or layers of puncture protection.</p><h3>Does it work?</h3><p>They say so, and Felt Bicycles has provided them with bikes to test it on. Eventually, SMART says the technology could be used for almost any type of vehicle. And, naturally, any type of bicycle, from road to gravel to mountain bikes, and especially commuter and e-bikes.</p><p>Here’s an interesting look at the development, how it works (evolution! <em>kidding</em>…it’s science!), and why (besides weight) they can’t use rubber tires off world:</p><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lv6Vs12jLc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p><p>Initially, they’ll probably sell them as a wheel+tire combo, but the long-term plan is that they’ll work on any rim. Right now, they’re still in testing with a target retail launch in first quarter 2022.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.smarttirecompany.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SmartTireCompany.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6e5bfffb75b2b1c5d1e22868ee68cff42c8ca921bd68568f79fe17193535c2a5","category":"Cycling"}
