Since then, Time grew to become a powerhouse in the cycling industry, arguably one of the most popular pedals at a time, before <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/12/time-cyclo-10-pedal-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fading in recent years</a>.</p><p>Arguably, the peak for Time was circa 2005 when its pedals were popular on both pro and amateur bikes. The Quickstep teams rode Time carbon frames, and Tom Boonen powered a Time VXRS Ulteam and RXS pedals to Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, and World Championship glory in one glorious season.</p><p>At that time, SRAM had not yet entered the road market. Fast forward 16 years and SRAM is now an industry leader well accustomed to acquiring other brands. What exactly SRAM has planned for the Time range, only time will tell. However, we did <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/heres-what-the-disappearance-of-powertap-might-mean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">speculate last week</a> what the disappearance of Powertap, another SRAM acquired brand, might mean. Could Time pedals provide another twist in that story?</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1d8722b3f83d3c1864a905f471ffcb37800b65c79240255e562113f9cda371d5","category":"Cycling"}
