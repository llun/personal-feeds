It is therefore no pleasure for the UCI to strongly recommend all concerned to refrain from hugging at the finish. However, due to the current pandemic it is essential to temporarily modify certain habits so that we can get back to normal as quickly as possible.”</p><p>The hug-focused protocol updates come amid other updates that extend COVID-19 health measures into the 2021 season, with the bubble-oriented approach remaining in place this season. Hugs are addressed in the “Ensure the protection of the team bubbles and the peloton bubble” subsection of the “Optimal conditions for organizing competitions” section of the UCI’s COVID-19 protocols.</p><p>The protocol is worded as follows: “Ask the riders to respect the basic preventive measures for stopping virus spread after crossing the finish line. Request riders not to hug teammates, other riders, or staff members when celebrating their victory. They must maintain a minimum distance between themselves and other riders, even after crossing the finish line.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c4c6d3b39c363f67bdba9fb3bf1eee23415d143d61840512e5a3018a338a6890","category":"Cycling"}
