Suter was dropped inside the last 20 km, but the remaining trio held out to contest the stage win amongst themselves.</p><p>Rosskopf led out on the finishing straight but when Bissegger kicked, he quickly surged past. Thomas came around Rosskopf but could not match Bissegger, who take a clear win at the line. Thomas settled for second with Rosskopf in third.
