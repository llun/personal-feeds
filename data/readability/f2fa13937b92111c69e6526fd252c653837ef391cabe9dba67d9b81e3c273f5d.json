We’re expecting the platform to have live daily coverage plus on-demand replays.</p><h2>Australia</h2><p>As usual it’s SBS TV that has exclusive broadcast rights to the Tour in Australia. Each stage will be live and free on TV (SBS HD) and streaming via On Demand and SBS’s Tour Tracker app. You’ll also be able to catch daily highlights and stage replays via those platforms.</p><p>Daily live coverage starts each night between 7:30-8:30pm AEST.
