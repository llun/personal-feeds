In Paris-Nice, wind also played a role in the race, slowing the peloton to a crawl.</p><p>The final 35 km of Tirreno-Adriatico were the most exciting kilometres of the day, with a few interesting moves from some of the top riders in cycling right now.</p><p>Read on for more from the world of cycling.</p><p><em>Abby Mickey<br>Associate Editor</em></p><h2>What’s News?</h2><h3>Julian Alaphilippe wins Tirreno-Adriatico stage 2</h3><p>Julian Alaphilippe took stage honors in Chiusdino on stage 2 of Tirreno-Adriatico, outsprinting Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert to take the victory. Van Aert holds on to his overall lead by only four seconds ahead of a long stage 3.</p><p>It was a relatively flat start to stage 2. A break of six got away in the opening kilometres, at one point leading the race by five minutes. Their advantage dropped significantly as the peloton charged toward the tail end of the course, where a series of small climbs would make the racing more interesting.</p><p>The leaders were swallowed by the peloton with 35 km to go and soon afterwards Egan Bernal attacked. The 2019 Tour de France champion went clear of the peloton with Kasper Asgreen and Jasper De Buyst in toe. The three did not stay away long, with a group of four attempting to bridge and bringing the peloton with them.</p><p>Simon Yates, Mikel Landa, João Almeida, and Pavel Sivakov were the next group to have a go off the front. There gap never increased over 30 seconds, but the move caused panic in the peloton as UAE-Team Emirates and Jumbo-Visma tried to organize and chase the four down.</p><p>Yates was the first to be distanced inside the final 2 km and in the final kilometre, Almeida dropped Landa and Sivakov. It looked promising for Almeida in the final 700 meters, but the peloton had reached maximum speed behind him.</p><p>Alaphilippe sprinted around his teammate in the final 50 meters, with Van der Poel and Van Aert on either side of the Frenchman.</p><p><strong>Top 10, Stage 2</strong></p><ol><li>ALAPHILIPPE Julian (Deceuninck – QuickStep) 5:01:32</li><li>VAN DER POEL Mathieu (Alpecin – Fenix) st</li><li>VAN AERT Wout (Team Jumbo – Visma) st</li><li>POGACAR Tadej (UAE – Team Emirates) st</li><li>ARANBURU Alex (Astana – Premier Tech) st</li><li>STANNARD Robert (Team BikeExchange) st</li><li>ALMEIDA João (Deceuninck – QuickStep) st</li><li>VAN AVERMAET Greg (AG2R Citroën) st</li><li>WELLENS Tim (Lotto Soudal) st</li><li>CICCONE Giulio (Trek-Segafredo) st</li></ol><p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p><ol id=\"block-10b38a80-5a08-476a-9119-bc1dbd3ab650\"><li>VAN AERT Wout (Team Jumbo – Visma)</li><li>ALAPHILIPPE Julian (Deceuninck – QuickStep) +0:04</li><li>VAN DER POEL Mathieu (Alpecin – Fenix) +0:08</li><li>SIVAKOV Pavel (Ineos Grenadiers) +0:11</li><li>LANDA Mikel (Bahrain – Victorious) +0:13</li><li>VENDRAME Andrea (AG2R Citroën) +0:14</li><li>STANNARD Robert (Team BikeExchange) st</li><li>ALMEIDA João (Deceuninck – QuickStep) st</li><li>POGACAR Tadej (UAE – Team Emirates) st</li><li>ARANBURU Alex (Astana – Premier Tech) st</li></ol><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pygdn8EBk2k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Sam Bennett wins again at Paris-Nice</h3><p>Sam Bennett won his second stage of Paris-Nice this year in Bolléne, with Nacer Bouhanni taking second and Pascal Ackermann third. Despite going down in a late-race crash, Primoz Roglic still leads the overall classification with Maximilian Schachmann 31 seconds behind and Brandon McNulty a further six seconds down.</p><p>“I was suffering the last few km. I don’t know what it is, but people won’t let me follow my own train here and it’s frustrating in the final. I just got back on just before the roundabout,” Bennett said at the finish. “It was a very hard final. I didn’t think I’d hold it to the line, but the guys did an incredible job and I’m proud that I could finish it off.”</p><p>It was an interesting day in Paris-Nice. A strong headwind encouraged the peloton to stay together and guaranteed a bunch sprint at the finish.</p><p>A highlight of the day may have been when an 11-rider break attempted to escape with 70 km to go. The entire move was made of Belgian riders, including Philippe Gilbert, Oliver Naesen, and Jasper Stuyven. The breakaway would have been a serious threat considering the quality of riders, but they were brought back rather quickly when the rest of the peloton caught on to their game.</p><p>With 35 km to go, Roglic went down along with his teammate Tony Martin. Roglic rejoined the peloton quickly, but Martin was not able to get back on his bike. At the finish Jumbo-Visma’s director, Grischa Niermann explained that Martin had significant pain in his elbow and had been taken to the hospital.</p><p>The final kilometre was hectic and after the race Bennett was critical of the other sprinter’s teams. “For some reason, I’m not being left to follow my own wheel. Guys are coming in and they just wanted to disrupt our sprint instead of concentrating on their own race. We don’t look at anybody else, so I don’t know why they’re getting so fixated on us,” said Bennett.</p><p><strong>Top 10, stage 5</strong></p><p>1 BENNETT Sam (Deceuninck – QuickStep) 5:16:01<br>2 BOUHANNI Nacer (Team Arkéa Samsic) st<br>3 ACKERMANN Pascal (Bora – hansgrohe) st<br>4 BAUHAUS Phil (Bahrain – Victorious) st<br>5 NIZZOLO Giacomo (Team Qhubeka ASSOS) st<br>6 KRISTOFF Alexander (UAE – Team Emirates) st<br>7 COQUARD Bryan (B&amp;B Hotels p/b KTM) st<br>8 LAPORE Christophe (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits) st<br>9 BARBIER Rudy (Israel Start-Up Nation) st<br>10 VAN POPPEL Danny (Intermarché – Wanty – Gobert Matériaux) st</p><p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p><p>1 ROGLIC Primoz (Team Jumbo-Visma) 13:26:40<br>2 SCHACHMANN Maximilian (BORA – hansgrohe) 0:31<br>3 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:37<br>4 IZAGIRRE Ion (Astana – Premier Tech) 0:40<br>5 VLASOV Aleksandr (Astana – Premier Tech) 0:41<br>6 JORGENSON Matteo (Movistar Team) 0:58<br>7 BENOOT Tiesj (Team DSM) 1:04<br>8 HAMILTON Lucas (Team BikeExchange) 1:08<br>9 SÁNCHEZ Luis León (Astana – Premier Tech) 1:11<br>10 LATOUR Pierre (Team Total Direct Energie) 1:12</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uvx7hrtFDqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Ellen van Dijk wins time trial at Healthy Ageing Tour</h3><p>Ellen van Dijk was dominant in the stage 2 time trial at the Healthy Ageing Tour.
