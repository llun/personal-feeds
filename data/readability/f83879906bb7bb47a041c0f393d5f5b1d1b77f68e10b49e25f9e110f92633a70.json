As a result, we have been <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac_Pro\">recommending for some time</a> that users not purchase the ‌iMac Pro‌ as a high-end standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> currently offers a better value.</p><p>There have been a few rumors of an updated ‌iMac Pro‌ over the years, including from analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> almost exactly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/\">one year ago</a>.</p><p>It's unclear whether the ‌iMac Pro‌ is being discontinued entirely or if Apple is selling through existing stock in advance of an update, but the unusual note about dwindling supplies suggests that the machine may indeed be on the verge of complete discontinuation. If an updated version is coming, it appears it may not be ready to launch for some time yet and there may be a gap in availability once the current model sells out.</p><p><em>(Thanks, Ben!)</em></p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/apple-transfer-icloud-photos-google-photos/\">Apple Launches Service for Transferring iCloud Photos and Videos to Google Photos</a></h3><p>Wednesday March 3, 2021 12:04 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple this week introduced a new service that's designed to make it quick and easy for iCloud users to transfer their stored photos and videos to Google Photos.
