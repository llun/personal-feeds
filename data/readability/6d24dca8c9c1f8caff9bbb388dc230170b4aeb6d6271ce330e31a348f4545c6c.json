But there are some questions you might not want to ask your local shop or riding buddies. AASQ is our weekly series where we get to the bottom of your questions – serious or otherwise. This time we discuss mountain bike tire profiles! Hit the link at the bottom of the post to submit your own question.</em></p><h2>What tire profile is best for cornering, and how do brands test grip on MTB tires?</h2><p>Last week, the World’s top mountain bike tire manufacturers joined us to answer your questions on how wheel size and tire width affect cornering grip. This week, the same experts are back, going deeper into the subtleties of MTB tires that help us go around corners. Thank you very much to Schwalbe, Vittoria, Continental, Maxxis, WTB and Michelin for the detailed explanations!</p><p><strong>People refer to “rounded” and “squared” tire profiles a lot in review articles. My local trails are very natural in character… there are no berms to speak of. The corners are flat with little to no support. Is one of these tire profiles objectively better for riding flat corners than the other? Or, does it simply come down to personal preference?</strong></p><p><strong>Schwalbe: </strong>There is always a tangential surface in contact during cornering, but the higher the air pressure, the more likely it is the contact patch (in terms of length/width) will shift depending on whether the tire profile is rounded or squared. That may result in better cornering or better braking/forward traction.</p><p><a

The difference in a rounded/squared profile will more likely result in a different feeling so that it comes down to personal preference.</p><p>Rounded profiles will feel more agile. You’ll need to lean the bike more as you corner to get the side knobs to grip the ground and vise versa for the squared profile.

As you lean the bike, a tire with designative intermediate knobs will make the bike more predictable because the knobs are distributed uniformly. Some people like that feeling especially on hard ground. Others like the feeling of tipping over onto the side (knobs) with a distinctive “channel”.</p><p><strong>Vittoria: </strong>In simple terms, a round profile will provide an even dispersion of tread on a given surface, as the tread is always tangent to the ground. At the other end of the spectrum, a squarer profile will force the side knobs into the terrain, providing more initial cornering bite.</p><p>If the tire is too round, there will typically not be a firm bite in mixed-surface cornering. If the tire is too square, then the tire will likely wash out at the cornering limit, as the rider leans past the edge of the profile.</p><figure id=\"attachment_249185\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-249185\"><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria mazza enduro tire review tread pattern muddy riding condition david cheskin credit\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vittoria-mazza-enduro-tire-review-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-249185\">Check out our tech piece on the Vittoria Mazza enduro tire <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/06/15/vittoria-mazza-all-terrain-enduro-tire-is-truckin-w-deep-aggressive-tread-pattern-and-burly-edges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.

For this reason, parts of the center studs are also engaged and the application of force is different compared to “flat cornering.” This why in berm cornering more speed can be generated.</p><p><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Continental-tires-new-softer-casing-new-treads-2018-mountian-bike-10-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>In “flat cornering” the angle at which the tire is positioned to the ground is much steeper, so it is mainly the outer studs that are in contact with the surface. For this reason, tires with pronounced and well-supported outer studs are particularly suitable for flat cornering, because they can better grab into the surface.</p><p>In addition, the transition from the central stud area to the side stud area should be designed harmoniously so that the transition to the outer studs works smoothly.</p><p><strong>Maxxis: </strong>In general, a rounded profile tire has better steering stability during corning due to the smoother contact footprint change from straight-to-cornering transition. A “squared” profile offers better straight away stability due to larger contact footprint, but the transition might not feel as smooth from straight to cornering.</p><figure id=\"attachment_251744\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-251744\"><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8.jpg\" alt=\"tire profile maxxis shorty mid spike\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Maxxis-Shorty-mid-spike-mud-tire-update-2021-mountain-bike-MTB-8-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-251744\">Profile of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/02/22/maxxis-shorty-gen-2-mtb-mid-spike-mud-tire-gains-traction-reduces-size-weight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maxxis Shorty Gen 2</a> Mid-Spike mud tire</figcaption></figure><p>This comes down to the type of corners and personal riding style; in your case a square profile would likely work better.</p><p><strong>WTB: </strong>This is a great question and I think if we go back to the dough (featured in last week’s <em><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/02/19/aasq-106-how-do-wheel-size-and-tire-width-relate-to-mtb-tire-cornering-grip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AASQ</a></em>) it’ll be a little easier to explain. If we’re assuming that all of the tires in question had the same width and volume, then the bulk of the tire’s profile would be shaped by the tread design – particularly the side knobs.</p><p>As the side knobs get bigger, they’ll create a flatter profile. As they get smaller, the profile will be more rounded. When tires have a flatter profile, it means you don’t have to lean the bike over very far before the side knobs start biting into the dirt. Big side knobs mean big cornering traction.</p><p>When tires have a more rounded profile, you’ll generally get consistent contact with the ground regardless of the angle you’re leaning at. This doesn’t mean consistent grip though because the more you lean over, the more the tire wants to slide out and the smaller knobs just won’t have the same bite as their larger counterparts.</p><figure id=\"attachment_252096\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-252096\"><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees.jpg\" alt=\"wtb mtb tires tread pattern imprint profile lean angle 45 degrees nineline verdict vigilant trail boss\" width=\"1200\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-297x173.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-800x467.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-120x70.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-768x448.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-696x406.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-1068x623.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/WTB-mtb-tire-profile-tread-imprints-lean-angle-45-degrees-720x420.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-252096\">A selection of WTB MTB Tire tread pattern imprints at a lean angle of 45 degrees.

Each tire was pressed into the dough, then leaned over to 45 degrees. As you move from left to right, the profiles get flatter, and you can clearly see how this changes the footprint left by each tire. The flatter the profile, the bigger the side knobs, the more bite as you lean over.</p><p>So, back to the original question: It’s actually quite a tricky one to answer because there are numerous factors that influence which tire you should choose. I would actually place tire profile more in the preference category.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, I’d prefer a slightly rounder profile on hard pack or “loose-over-hard” terrain to maximize contact, and a flatter profile when the ground is softer to maximize bite.</p><p><strong>Michelin: </strong>Based on my experience with riders in my MTB career, “rounded” and “squared” tire profiles are a matter of personal preference. Some Michelin riders prefer a stable, more squared tire, while others prefer a more reactive, rounded tire.</p><p><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front.jpg\" alt=\"michelin wild enduro front\" width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-297x161.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-800x433.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-120x65.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-768x416.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-696x377.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-1068x580.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-775x420.jpg 775w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-297x161.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-800x433.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-120x65.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-768x416.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-696x377.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-1068x580.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-Wild-Enduro-front-775x420.jpg 775w\"></a></p><p>Enduro riders prefer more natural trails and a squared profile for stability, while DH riders prefer rounded tires for their reactivity and ease of balancing from left to right.

The pros are certainly a crucial part of that process and we’ve had numerous prototype products on EWS bikes over the years without anybody knowing.</p><p><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3.jpg\" alt=\"wtb verdict\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WTB-Verdict-dry-or-wet-spike-MTB-tire-2-5-3-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>However, our test roster is not limited solely to pros because it’s not just pros that’ll use them. We make sure to cover all angles when it comes to testing so that when we finally release the product, we can be confident it’ll perform as it should. If our testing duped us and we’re not happy with the production tire…we’ll even update it down the line because if we’re going to sell a product with the WTB name on it, we want to make sure it’s the best available.</p><p><strong>Michelin: </strong>Michelin has the unique ability to utilize various chemists and engineers to develop specific rubber compounds that attribute to a wide range of product applications. Michelin follows special test methods to evaluate cornering grip and comparison of consistency.</p><p>In addition to objective testing of a rubber compound’s grip, test riders provide subjective feedback to define the final product. Riders using prototype tires will replicate their test runs to compare traction at the same speed in the same corner, or to increase the speed at the limit of traction for both solutions.</p><p><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22.jpg\" alt=\"michelin dh 22 leant over flat cornering grip\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-630x420.jpg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICHELIN-DH-22-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>If a rider is increasing speed with all the same settings on their bike, traction has increased resulting in faster cornering. When testing cornering, the feeling of losing grip is also important, and it’s valuable for riders to understand where they are compared to the maximum limit of traction.</p><p><em>Thank you so much to the following contributors to this week’s Ask A Stupid Question:</em></p><div><ul><li>James Heaton, European PR Guru at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WTB</a></li><li>Alexander Hänke, Product Manager at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Continental</span>&nbsp;Bicycle Tires</a></li><li>Robert Mennen, Product manager at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.schwalbe.com/en/start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Schwalbe</a></li><li>Aaron Chamberlain of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.maxxis.co.uk/tyres/cycle/mountain-bike\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Maxxis</a>, with input from their engineering teams in the US and Taiwan</li><li>Vincent Ledieu,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.michelin.co.uk/bicycle/mtb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Michelin</span></a>&nbsp;bicycle business segment manager and race program leader</li><li>Ken Avery, Senior Vice President of Product Development at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vittoria.com/ww/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vittoria Tires</a></li></ul><p><em>Got&nbsp;a question of your own?
