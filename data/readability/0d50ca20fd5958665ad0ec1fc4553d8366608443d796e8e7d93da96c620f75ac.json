In addition to being convenient, this wireless connectivity will soon become more important, as reputable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously claimed that Apple will introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">at least one high-end iPhone without a Lightning connector</a> this year, resulting in the device being completely portless.</p><p>The fourth-generation Outlander is equipped with a 9-inch touchscreen that provides access to both wireless CarPlay and Android Auto. Wireless smartphone charging is also available alongside standard USB-A and USB-C charging ports.</p><p>Depending on the trim level, the 2022 Outlander can be fitted with up to 20-inch wheels, a 10.8-inch heads-up display on the windshield, a 10-speaker Bose audio system, a panoramic sunroof, and other options. The vehicle is powered by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine and is equipped with three-row seating as standard equipment.</p><p>Mitsubishi says the 2022 Outlander will be available at North American dealerships starting April 2021, with U.S. pricing starting at $25,795.</p><p>Wireless CarPlay is finally beginning to see wider adoption, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/15/honda-hyundai-wireless-carplay/\">several automakers now rolling out the feature</a> in select regions, including Hyundai, Honda, Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.
