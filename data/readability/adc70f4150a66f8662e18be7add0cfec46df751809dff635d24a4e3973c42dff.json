There's also wording preventing Apple from retaliating against developers who choose alternate distribution and payment methods.</p><p>Apple Chief Privacy Engineer Erik Neuenschwander spoke out against the bill, saying that it \"threatens to destroy the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as you know it\" by requiring changes that would \"undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance\" of the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå.</p><p>Neuenschwander said that Apple \"works hard\" to keep bad apps from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, and North Dakota's bill would \"require us to let them in.\"</p><p>Apple does not allow apps to be installed on iOS devices outside of the ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå and there are no alternate app store options that are available. Apple reviews every app that is made available for its customers to download, something that would not happen with a third-party app store option.</p><p>Apple also does not let app developers accept payments through methods other than in-app purchase except in select situations, a policy that has led to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/\">legal fight</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>. ‚ÄåEpic Games‚Äå added an alternate payment method to Fortnite last year, leading the app to be banned from the ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå.</p><p>Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who was also embroiled in a legal fight with Apple over email app \"HEY\" last year, testified in favor of SB 2333 and said that it gives him hope that \"tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever.\"</p><div><blockquote><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">North Dakota's SB 2333 is the first real, concrete legislative proposal I've seen that actually gives me hope that tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever. Fargo or Bismarck sound like wonderful places to set up shop under a shield against abuse üòÇüòç ‚Äî DHH (@dhh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1359203441827078145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In 2020, Apple faced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/23/doj-tech-company-antitrust-review/\">U.S. antitrust inquiry</a> into its ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå fees and policies, which resulted in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/06/us-antitrust-report-apple-recommendations/\">a 450 page report</a> calling for new antitrust laws focused on promoting fair competition in digital markets, strengthening laws related to mergers and monopolization, and restoring vigorous oversight and enforcement of antitrust law.</p><p>No federal legislation has been introduced as of yet, and the North Dakota Senate committee did not take action on the bill. Senator Jerry Klein said that there's \"still some mulling to be done\" in reference to the bill.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyer‚Äôs Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
