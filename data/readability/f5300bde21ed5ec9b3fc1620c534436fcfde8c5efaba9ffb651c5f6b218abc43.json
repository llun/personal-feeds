The battle for the breakaway was attritional and lasted long into the afternoon, but they would be caught on the final climb.</p><p>All eyes were on Rigoberto Urán (EF Education-Nippo) who had just 17 seconds to make up, but race leader Carapaz was glued to his wheel. Michael Woods (Israel Start-Up Nation) made the most convincing attack near the top of the Gotthardpass, pursued by Mäder who caught the Canadian on the descent. Although the gap was not big to the chasers, the pair stayed away and the young Swiss rider won the sprint. Mattia Cattaneo (Deceuninck-QuickStep) led the GC group home nine seconds later.</p><p>Max Schachmann (Bora-Hansgrohe) had struggled on the ascent and finished 11 seconds behind the GC group, meaning Jakob Fuglsang (Astana) stepped up to third overall, just four seconds ahead of the German. The margin between first and second overall was unchanged, with Carapaz taking his first stage race victory since the 2019 Giro d’Italia.</p><div><div><p>Tour de Suisse (2.UWT) <span>Andermatt → Andermatt</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/bc/gino-mader-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f5300bde21ed5ec9b3fc1620c534436fcfde8c5efaba9ffb651c5f6b218abc43","category":"Cycling"}
