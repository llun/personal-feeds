It is not clear, however, if LG Display will supply Apple with this display panel for mass production once it has been developed.</p><p>Samsung <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/\">has been rumored</a> to be Apple's supplier of choice for an OLED foldable display and the company was said to have provided Apple with a large number of foldable display samples for testing last year, so it is unclear how the news of a collaboration with LG fits into this. Apple has used both LG and Samsung OLED displays for the ‌iPhone‌ to date, and it is possible that the display for the long-rumored foldable ‌iPhone‌ may be provided by both suppliers.</p><p>Yesterday, it was reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/7-inch-foldable-iphone-with-apple-pencil-2023/\">planning to launch</a> a foldable ‌iPhone‌ with a 7-inch OLED display and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> support as soon as 2023. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">researching foldable devices</a> since 2016, but rumors surrounding a foldable ‌iPhone‌ have noticeably increased in recent months, suggesting that the device may be gathering momentum behind the scenes.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/14/heart-month-activity-challenge/\">Apple's Heart Month Activity Challenge Requires 60 Minutes of Exercise on Valentine's Day</a></h3><p>Saturday February 13, 2021 10:15 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/frank-mcshan/\" rel=\"author\">Frank McShan</a></p><p>Today only, Apple Watch owners can complete a new Apple Watch activity challenge in celebration of Heart Month, which is aimed at promoting cardiovascular health.
