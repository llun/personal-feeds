The Ineos Grenadiers and UAE-Team Emirates led the way into the uphill finale, and then Alex Aranburu launched his sprint with around 300 meters to go.</p><p>Colbrelli quickly jumped onto his wheel, however, and the duo opened a sizable gap to the rest of the field. With a little over 100 meters to go, Colbrelli jumped and surged past Aranburu, holding on to take his first win of the year at the line. Aranburu settled for second with Brandon McNulty (UAE-Team Emirates) nabbing third on the day.</p><div><div><p>Critérium du Dauphiné (2.UWT) <span>Langeac → Saint-Haon-Le-Vieux</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ca/sonny-colbrelli-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"fb0d457864c53d42af8efaf7128b5627cb91659c72ddf80e88fa8638717a4bee","category":"Cycling"}
