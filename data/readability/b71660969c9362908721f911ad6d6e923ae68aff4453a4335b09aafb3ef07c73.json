{"title":"Soon, you may be able to change the default music service in iOS","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740520","date":1612806661000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><h4>Siri â€”</h4><h2 itemprop=\"description\">\"Hey Siri, stop making me say 'on Spotify' 40 times a day.\"</h2></div><div itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p>It had long been an inescapable fact about Apple's iOS operating system for iPhones that you couldn't change your default apps away from those made by Apple itself.&nbsp;But only a few months after Apple changed course and allowed users to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/ios-and-ipados-14-review-iphone-transformation-ipad-iteration/#h15\">change the default email or browser apps</a>, it now appears that same choice is coming for music-streaming services.</p><p>After Apple recently pushed out the first public beta of iOS 14.5, a Reddit user quickly <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/\">discovered</a> that the first time they asked Siri to play a song after updating, they were given a prompt to pick which streaming service to use. Subsequent prompts then obeyed that selection.</p><p>Other users on Reddit and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/\">MacRumors</a> confirmed similar experiences. They also confirmed that it works if you specify the streaming service verbally, for example, by saying, \"Hey Siri, play Heroes by David Bowie on Spotify.\"</p><p>Before the iOS 14.5 beta, that \"on [service name here]\" phrasing was required every time you wanted to play a song on something other than Apple Music. But now, you only need to say \"on Spotify\" the first time.&nbsp;Well, that seems to be the intention, anyway. This is a beta release, and the users who have shared their experiences say that it's buggy and inconsistent. Only certain phrases work, and sometimes the selection gets reset.</p><p>Assuming the bugs get worked out, this could be a particular boon for Apple's HomePod speakers. When we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/review-apples-homepod-is-a-fun-apple-music-accessory-and-thats-it/\">reviewed the first HomePod</a>, we criticized it for only working well with Apple Music, while other (sometimes cheaper) smart speakers are more service-agnostic.</p><p>We don't know exactly why Apple has changed course so drastically on default app behaviors for iOS, but one possibility is that the company sees these changes as a way to handicap ongoing and upcoming antitrust investigations and lawsuits.</p><p>iOS 14.5 is expected to arrive in early spring and is also expected to introduce the much-discussed controversial <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/why-facebook-and-apple-are-going-to-war-over-privacy/\">user ad-tracking opt-in requirement</a> that companies like Facebook have been battling publicly.&nbsp;Should the default music service behavior change make it to the final public release of iOS 14.5, it's likely to appear in iPadOS as well.</p><p><em>Listing image by Samuel Axon</em></p></div></div>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b71660969c9362908721f911ad6d6e923ae68aff4453a4335b09aafb3ef07c73","category":"Tech"}
