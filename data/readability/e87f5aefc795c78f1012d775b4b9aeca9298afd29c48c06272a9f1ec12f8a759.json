{"title":"Google Maps for Android officially gets dark mode support","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744797","date":1614186811000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><h4>Took long enough â€”</h4><h2 itemprop=\"headline\">Dark mode arrives on Google Maps for Android a year and a half late</h2><h2 itemprop=\"description\">Google Maps is the last major Google app to support dark mode.</h2></div><div itemprop=\"articleBody\"><p>539 days after Android's dark mode officially launched with Android 10, Google Maps has finally decided to support the feature. Google's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-spring-2021\">latest blog post</a>&nbsp;says that dark mode in Google Maps is \"soon expanding to all Android users globally,\" making the feature official after lots of public experiments.</p><p>Google's uneven rollout strategy makes it hard to nail down when any feature officially \"launches.\" Some users have had dark mode for a while, though, through various experiments and early rollouts. Google has <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/09/dark-mode-signs-show-up-in-google-maps/\">been teasing</a> a dark mode for Google Maps since October 2019, and experimental rollouts hit some users in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/j20h5l/google_maps_dark_mode_ui/\">September 2020.</a>&nbsp;Google Maps has also been showing a dark-colored map in navigation mode for some time, but that's not the same thing as a comprehensive dark mode for all the UI elements.</p><p>If Google Maps is following Android's best practices, the UI&nbsp;<em>should</em> automatically switch over to the dark theme if your system settings have dark mode enabled. Google says you'll also be able to find a new \"theme\" section in the Google Maps settings, when you can toggle the feature manually. The Google Maps dark mode that has been floating around for a while has been on a server-side switch. The code is already on your device, so there's no version we can point to that will enable dark mode; you just have to wait for Google to flag your account.</p><p>With Google Maps finally on the dark mode train, that should cover all of Google's major apps. The Play Store, Gmail, Google Assistant, Chrome, Calendar, Drive, Photos, and YouTube all support dark mode.</p><p><em>Listing image by Google</em></p></div></div>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e87f5aefc795c78f1012d775b4b9aeca9298afd29c48c06272a9f1ec12f8a759","category":"Tech"}
