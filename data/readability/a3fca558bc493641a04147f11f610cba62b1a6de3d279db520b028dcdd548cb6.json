This is certainly the case when compared to the 2020 campaign which was decimated due to the global pandemic. Multiple races were cancelled, including for the first time since World War II, Paris-Roubaix.</span></p><p><span>‘The Hell of the North’ is one of cycling’s five monuments and is perhaps the most popular and prestigious one-day race in cycling. However, in an article in La Parisienne this morning it was confirmed that Paris Roubaix has been postponed for a third time and will not be taking place on April 11th.</span></p><p><span>We were set to witness the inaugural Women’s Paris-Roubaix in 2020, yet this was delayed by a year due to the pandemic. The postponement of this year’s event means the first women’s Paris-Roubaix will once again have to wait until a later date.</span></p><p><span>Both editions of Paris-Roubaix were due to take place on Sunday 11th April 2021. However, French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a month-long lockdown across multiple regions of France including Paris last Thursday.</span></p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><p><span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a>&nbsp;</strong></em><br></span></p><p><span>Speaking to France Bleu on Monday, Michel Lalande,&nbsp;</span><span>who is the prefect of the Hauts-de-France region which encompasses Roubaix was asked about Paris-Roubaix. “</span><span>I'll give you an answer when the time is right, but you can guess it”, said Laland.</span></p><p><span>All WorldTour races for men and women have gone ahead in 2021 thus far, including Strade Bianche, Milan-Sanremo and Trofeo Alfredo Binda. Paris-Roubaix was far from the only event to fall to the pandemic last year, though. Other WorldTour events that were cancelled include the Volta Catalunya, Amstel Gold Race and the Tour de Romandie. However, the Volta Catalunya has returned to the calendar in 2021 and is currently&nbsp;taking place in the northern Spanish region.</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB2_5873_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616433052\" alt=\"Roubaix Velodrome 2019\"><em>Paris-Roubaix, 2019 (Alex Broadway/SWpix)</em></p><p><span>Despite this news, the Belgian Classics are expected to continue. When asked on this matter, Lalande responded, “<span>Someone will have to explain to me the coherence between the safety precaution for COVID. Someone will have to explain it to me.\"</span></span><span>&nbsp;Clearly, Lalande was surprised that&nbsp;racing in Belgium is set to continue amidst the pandemic.</span></p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gallery-milan-san-remo-2021\">Related – Milan-San Remo 2021 Gallery</a></strong></em></p><p><span>Adding to his earlier comments, Lalande said, “The sky now looks less blue”. Many would’ve hoped for the clouds to show themselves on the day of Paris-Roubaix - rain can often shake up the race making it even more unpredictable.</span></p><p><span>Although there is no official confirmation of the postponed date yet, we hope that the sky will remain blue and we will see Paris-Roubaix at some point this season.</span></p></div></div></article></div></div>","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"a3fca558bc493641a04147f11f610cba62b1a6de3d279db520b028dcdd548cb6","category":"Cycling"}
