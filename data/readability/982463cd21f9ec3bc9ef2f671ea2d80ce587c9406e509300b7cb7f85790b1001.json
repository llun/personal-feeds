That award goes to Instagram, which shares a staggering 79% of your data with other companies. Including everything from purchasing information, personal data, and browsing history. No wonder there's so much promoted content on your feed.</p><p>With over 1 billion monthly active users it's worrying that Instagram is a hub for sharing such a high amount of its unknowing users' data.</p></blockquote><p>Apps that collect data for third-party use do so for targeting purposes, sharing the info across different apps and websites. Apps also collect data to market their own products, with Facebook and Instagram again collecting the most data in this category.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, apps that don't collect much data include Signal, Clubhouse, Netflix, Shazam, Etsy, Skype, and Telegram.</p><p>Starting with the launch of iOS 14.5, Apple will begin requiring apps that access a user's advertising identifier for cross-app and website tracking to get express permission before using it, which may help cut down on some of the third-party data sharing.</p><p>Prior to downloading an app, it's always worth checking out the App Privacy label to see just what data is being collected, primarily in \"Data Used to Track You\" and \"Data Linked to You\" sections, which include data collected for third-party advertising and for the developer's own advertising or marketing.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad/\">Apple Shares 'Jump' AirPods Pro Ad</a></h3><p>Sunday March 14, 2021 9:09 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple today shared a new AirPods Pro-focused ad called \"Jump\" on its YouTube channel, highlighting the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency features of the earbuds in a creative way.
