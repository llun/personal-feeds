In our view, a refurbished Mac mini is virtually indistinguishable from a brand new model, so this represents a good opportunity for savings. However, keep in mind that third-party resellers may offer better deals over time, so be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">monitor our deals roundup</a>.</p><p>Apple's refurbished Macs are covered by a one-year limited warranty and have a 14-day return policy.
