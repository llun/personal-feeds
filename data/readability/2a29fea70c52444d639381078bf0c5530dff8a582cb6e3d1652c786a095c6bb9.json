VLC 4.0 isn't ready for prime time use yet—but because the program is open source, adventurous users can grab <a href=\"https://artifacts.videolan.org/vlc/nightly-snap/\">nightly builds</a> of it to take a peek at what's coming. The screenshots we're about to show come from the nightly build released last Friday—<a href=\"https://artifacts.videolan.org/vlc/nightly-snap/20210212-0431/\">20210212-0431</a>.</p><h2>Goodbye file-opener, hello media jukebox</h2><div><ul><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VMC-3.0.9.2-vs-4.0.0-dev-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VMC-3.0.9.2-vs-4.0.0-dev.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VMC-3.0.9.2-vs-4.0.0-dev-980x469.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VMC-3.0.9.2-vs-4.0.0-dev-1440x690.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1742422\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1742422\"><span></span><p>On the left, we have the version of VLC that ships with Ubuntu Focal—3.0.9.2.

The new VLC instead opens to a media-browser interface, showing thumbnails of all videos present in the user's Videos folder.</p><p>This is the view associated with the Video view displayed along the new version's top menu bar; it also presents Music, Browse, and Discover. Music offers a similar view into the user's Music folder, Discover presents a network browser looking for shares and streams present on the user's LAN, and Discover does not appear to have been fully implemented yet.</p><p>Another major change isn't evident until you open a video. In older versions of VLC, a single window provided both the video content and its controls. VLC 4.0 instead spawns a new player window, separate from the browsing/control window from which the video was selected.</p><h2>File system? What file system?

If you want to get out of your Videos directory, you'll need to click the hamburger menu on the upper left of the playlist and select Media &gt; Open Directory. Selecting Open Directory, unfortunately, doesn't actually take you to the new directory—instead, it scans all files both inside and beneath the new directory you select and adds them all, willy-nilly, to the Videos tab itself.</p><p>This folder-scanning, browser-updating metaphor is highly reminiscent of the \"Movies\" interface of the <a href=\"https://kodi.tv/\">Kodi media player</a>—in theory, it abstracts away the inconvenience of managing folders and files entirely, giving you a single plane of glass within which to view all your content. But it doesn't fit too many use cases. I don't necessarily&nbsp;<em>want</em> to see all the dumb memes I've downloaded and video clips I've recorded with my webcam when I'm looking for movies, or vice versa.</p><p>The Kodi media player wisely retains a \"Files\" interface for those who want to see their content organized by folder—but so far as we can tell, VLC 4.0 has neither retained a way to get to the old file-based interface nor implemented a new version.</p><p>It's also quite difficult to find the filename or location of media that's already in your library. You can't do it at all from the library view itself, but while a particular item is playing, you can right-click it, select Tools, then select Media Information.</p><h2>Did we mention it’s a work in progress?</h2><p>The current version of VLC 4.0.0-dev isn't suitable for a lot of the use cases that earlier versions of VLC were—but it's not yet clear how much of that is by design and how much is because the new version simply isn't done.</p><p>VLC 4.0 has been in development for roughly two years now; it was first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/media_vlc/\">announced</a> at FOSDEM in February 2019, with early nightly builds becoming available to the public in the same <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2019/02/06/vlc-media-player-4-0/\">month</a>. VideoLAN foundation President Jean-Baptiste Kempf told <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/vlc-history-open-source\">Protocol</a>&nbsp;that 4.0 would be released sometime in 2021—but there's still no concrete release date.</p></div></div></div>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a29fea70c52444d639381078bf0c5530dff8a582cb6e3d1652c786a095c6bb9","category":"Tech"}
