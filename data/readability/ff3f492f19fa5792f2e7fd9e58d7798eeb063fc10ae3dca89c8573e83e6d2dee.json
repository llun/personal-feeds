The difference? Whey tends to work quickly to boost free amino acids to give muscles the building blocks they need to start recovery.</p><p>Casein digests more slowly, acting sort of like a time release to deliver a consistent supply of aminos for hours after your workout. Mix it with milk if you want more of both, or stick to water, it mixed well with either.</p><p>It adds organic cane sugar to sweeten it and help replenish your glycogen stores. They also add electrolytes, green tea extract, L-Glutamine, and Vitamin D. Available in Vanilla or Chocolate, a 14-serving tub <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3d4ARS7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">runs $35.00</a>. Each serving provides 17-18g protein and 19g carbs.</p><p><a href=\"https://bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1.jpg\" alt=\"osmo blueberry pomegranate hydration\" width=\"1200\" height=\"787\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1.jpg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-297x195.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-800x525.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-120x79.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-768x504.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-696x456.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-1068x700.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-640x420.jpg 640w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-741x486.jpg 741w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-297x195.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-800x525.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-120x79.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-768x504.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-696x456.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-1068x700.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-640x420.jpg 640w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/bikerumor-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/osmo-blueberry-pomegranate-hydration-drink-mix-1-741x486.jpg 741w\"></a></p><p>They also have a new Blueberry Pomegranate flavor of their classic Active Hydration formula. Like the others (which include Blackberry, ), it’s vegan and gluten/dairy-free, and uses real fruit to flavor it. Unlike other brands, it keeps the solution to about 3.5%, which is roughly half the osmolality of others. They say this more closely matches that of the body so that it’ll move through your stomach more quickly and absorb faster.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-medrectangle-3\"></span></p><p>Available, a 40-serving canister <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3jFc73Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retails for $20</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/375uhHa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>OsmoNutrition.com</em></a></p><p><em>Disclosure: Some of these links are affiliate links that may earn a small commission for Bikerumor if you click on them and buy something.
