The Belgian rider was joined by Soren Kragh Andersen and although the two looked like they would not make it to the line, Stuyven just held off a pack of strong sprinters to take the victory.</p><p>“I can’t describe how I feel. It’s unbelievable,” Stuyven said after the finish. “We had a plan to go for it, to try to win. I felt really good all day and the finale went well. There was a lot of fast guys in the group after the Poggio, so I knew I had to try all or nothing and I did. If it’d had gone to the line I could have finished fifth or tenth but I preferred to go all in, so I took the biggest victory of my career.”</p><p>Caleb Ewan (Lotto Soudal) was the best of the rest with Wout van Aert (Team Jumbo-Visma) taking third on the day.</p><p><em>***Copyrighted material is used under Fair Use and therefore this video is NOT MONETISED.
