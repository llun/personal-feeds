Some users have also reported being unable to get the setting to surface, so it's possible not all users will see it in this beta.<br></p><h2>How to Change Your Default Music Service</h2><p>At the current time, there's no ‌Siri‌ command or music setting to manually change the default music app that you've set through the ‌Siri‌ interface.</p><p>You can ask ‌Siri‌ to play music on a different music service and sometimes that will shift the default. So if you've set Spotify as your default but want to change back to ‌Apple Music‌, you can say \"Hey ‌Siri‌, play Fleetwood Mac on ‌Apple Music‌,\" or vice versa, \"Hey ‌Siri‌, play Fleetwood Mac on Spotify.\"</p><p>This will sometimes change the default music setting, but it's not entirely reliable. You can also sometimes get the list to reappear by asking about different services in quick succession or when downloading a new music service app, but for now, if you want a hassle-free experience, make sure to set it to the music service that your use most often.</p><p>We expect Apple to flesh out the feature further in future betas, so it's likely that there will eventually be a toggle to set a music app as the default across iOS, similar to how the settings work for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/21/gmail-default-mail-app-ios/\">default mail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/google-chrome-default-browser-ios/\">browser apps</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/macbook-pro-copy-iphone-design/\">New MacBook Pro Expected to Copy Familiar iPhone Design</a></h3><p>Apple's upcoming 2021 MacBook Pro is expected to take design cues from the iPhone 12, according to well-respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
