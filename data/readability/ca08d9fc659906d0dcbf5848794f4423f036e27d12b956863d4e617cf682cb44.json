Maybe you’re more concerned about privacy, or you’re tired of buying phones that only get operating system updates a year or two. Maybe you have a Mac, and want a phone that works seamlessly with it.</p><p>Whatever the reason, we’re here to help make your transition from Android to iPhone as smooth as possible. Grab your old Android phone and your new iPhone and let’s make the switch.</p><h2>Transfer data from Android using the Move to iOS app</h2><p>Apple’s got a fancy marketing page all about why you should <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=US-002-3541527-000-000000-web&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/switch/&amp;subId3=xid:fr1615329881255baf\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-orig-url=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=US-002-3541527-000-000000-web&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/switch/\" data-ml-id=\"1\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1615329881255baf\">switch from Android to iPhone</a>. It’s more hype than usable advice, but the Apple does make a great resource for making the switch: an Android app!</p><p>On your old Android phone, download the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios\" rel=\"nofollow\">Move to iOS app</a> from the Google Play store.

If you opted not to transfer your Google account during that process, or you didn’t use the Move to iOS app (it can be finicky at times, and some users report problems getting it to work properly), you’ll have to add it yourself.</p><p>It's easy! On your iPhone, tap <em>Settings</em> and then tap <i>Mail.</i>&nbsp;Tap <em>Accounts</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Add Account</em>, and then choose <em>Google</em> from the list. Your iPhone will open up a Google login page where you’ll enter your account name and password.</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/ios-add-account-100880120-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>\n<p>Add your Google account to sync mail, notes, calendar, and contacts.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"ios add account\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1697\" data-imageid=\"100880120\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/ios-add-account-100880120-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/ios-add-account-100880120-large.jpg\"></a><small>IDG</small><figcaption><p>Add your Google account to sync mail, notes, calendar, and contacts.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once your account is added, you can select it in the Accounts list and choose whether or not you want to sync your Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Notes. These options will bring data from your Google account into the iOS Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Notes apps, but if you plan to use Google’s apps on your iPhone instead of Apple’s, you have the option to disable these toggles.</p><p>You can download a copy of your data from Google cloud services at <a href=\"https://takeout.google.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">takeout.google.com</a>. If you would like to, for example, download a copy of all your photos and videos from Google Photos in order to upload them again to iCloud, that's where you would start.</p><h2>Enjoy Google apps on iPhone</h2><p>Google makes a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480#see-all/developer-other-apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">ton of apps for iPhone</a>. Moving to iOS doesn’t mean you have to give up your favorite Google apps, just that they won’t necessarily work exactly the same way as they did on your Android phone. In particular, you can’t make them a default app—when you open a mail link it will open Apple’s Mail app, not the Gmail app, for example.</p><p>In particular, you’ll probably want to download <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar-time-planner/id909319292\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Calendar</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-photos/id962194608\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Photos</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Maps</a>. If you really want to retain as many of the Google apps you’re used to on Android, the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google app</a> will give you the search and Discover feed you’re accustomed to, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-assistant/id1220976145\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Assistant</a> is your Siri replacement (though you have to launch the app to use it), and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chrome</a> will make your browser feel more familiar.</p><p>Of course, third-party apps like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netflix</a> all exist on iPhone and both look and operate very similar to how they do on Android. You’ll just have to log in with your account and all your content should be there. Remember to give yourself time to do things like download music or videos that you want to watch offline.</p><p>If you don’t want to lose progress in any of your games, you’ll have to make sure they have some sort of online save functionality. In many popular games, you can log in with either your Facebook account or an account specifically for the game and it will save your progress. Just make sure you log in with the same account when you download the game again on your iPhone.</p><h2>Don’t try to turn iOS into Android</h2><p>It’s easy enough to add your Google account to your iPhone and download Google apps to to use instead of Apple's own apps, but we suggest you don’t go overboard right away.</p><p>After transferring your data and logging into your Google account, try sticking with Siri instead of Assistant, Safari instead of Chrome, Apple Maps instead of Google Maps, Apple Photos instead of Google Photos, at least for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>It will feel weird at first, and there are lots of little details to get used to. But Apple’s apps are more tightly integrated with the operating system, similar to the way Google’s apps are on most Android phones, and in general they’re built with better privacy protections. After giving yourself a few weeks to adjust, you may find you like Apple’s apps better, at least in some ways.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
