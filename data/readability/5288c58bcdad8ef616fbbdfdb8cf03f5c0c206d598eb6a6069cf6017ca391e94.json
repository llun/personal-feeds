The 22-year-old rider was the surprise winner of stage 1 at Paris-Nice earlier this year, and it looked for a while like his time around the Fraunfeld course might also be untouchable. But European champion Küng rode a perfect TT and finished four seconds faster than his young compatriot. Italian rider Mattia Cattaneo of Deceuninck-QuickStep joined the Swiss pair on the podium in third place.</p><p>There were no disasters for the GC favourites, with Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-QuickStep) finishing strongest in fifth place, and Neilson Powless (EF Education-Nippo), Maximilian Schachmann (Bora-Hansgrohe) and Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers) just outside the top 10. Jumbo-Visma’s Tom Dumoulin made his return to racing with a creditable 16th place having not raced since last October.</p><div><div><p>Tour de Suisse (2.UWT) <span>Frauenfeld → Frauenfeld</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/da/stefan-kung-2021.jpeg\"></p></div><div><div><p>Tour de Suisse (2.UWT) <span>Frauenfeld → Frauenfeld</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/da/stefan-kung-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"5288c58bcdad8ef616fbbdfdb8cf03f5c0c206d598eb6a6069cf6017ca391e94","category":"Cycling"}
