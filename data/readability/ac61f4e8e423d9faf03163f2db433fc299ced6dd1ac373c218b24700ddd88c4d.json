At the bottom of the base, there's a built-in Qi-based wireless charger that's meant to be used for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>. There's a small hollow where the ‌AirPods‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> fit, and positioning the ‌AirPods‌ case within this hollow ensures that it's in the proper position for charging.</p><p><img alt=\"belkin charger next to 3 in 1\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/4-Nk3coY3tUDzbN5ks6gK9LUU9g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/4-Nk3coY3tUDzbN5ks6gK9LUU9g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/4-Nk3coY3tUDzbN5ks6gK9LUU9g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/LpEyQgyI-mEY0rIzMmVxXzk0E78=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/-JBsfiHljI1croSpmKI9rJwQegk=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/FxTo-Rjl0iOMqZamc3Z7-1_PF9E=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/4-Nk3coY3tUDzbN5ks6gK9LUU9g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/LpEyQgyI-mEY0rIzMmVxXzk0E78=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/-JBsfiHljI1croSpmKI9rJwQegk=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/FxTo-Rjl0iOMqZamc3Z7-1_PF9E=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg 2500w\"><br>Even though the Qi charger at the base is designed for ‌AirPods‌, it also works with other iPhones and smartphones that support Qi-based charging. The hollow is bigger and wider than the hollow Belkin added for the 3-in-1 charger, but it still works for iPhones of all sizes.

The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a> maxes out at 12W, which the 2-in-1 charger also accommodates. The 2-in-1 charger is weighted a bit, but you do need to use a grab and twist gesture to undock an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> without lifting the charger itself. I've had no problems with this, and just giving that small twist when pulling up keeps it on my desk where it belongs.</p><p>With Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ chargers you need to make sure you have the appropriate power adapter, which is not included, but there's no guesswork involved with the Boost Charge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charger Stand because it comes with a power adapter.</p><p><img alt=\"belkin charger power adapter\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1254\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/cn77P5edB-fEXBvRgiZdx3RStnI=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/cn77P5edB-fEXBvRgiZdx3RStnI=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/cn77P5edB-fEXBvRgiZdx3RStnI=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_3bPrNixJ7rJX9IaDdlBLpAe5Ns=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/f6rHFkjteo5TMN0wNktqSahPApg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/LxaNb7De326e_ZL5PsF6so51qCo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/cn77P5edB-fEXBvRgiZdx3RStnI=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_3bPrNixJ7rJX9IaDdlBLpAe5Ns=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/f6rHFkjteo5TMN0wNktqSahPApg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/LxaNb7De326e_ZL5PsF6so51qCo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg 2500w\"><br>The circular base of the Belkin 2-in-1 ‌MagSafe‌ Charger doesn't take up too much room on a desk (it's about 5.3 inches at its widest point), which I appreciate, and the upright ‌MagSafe‌ charging arm can be used in either portrait or landscape mode. The charging arm is angled slightly to put the ‌iPhone‌ in an ideal position for watching videos, taking <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls, or glancing over to see the time at night.</p><p>The 2-in-1 ‌MagSafe‌ Charger comes in either black or white, and there's a small LED light on the base that lights up when the Qi-based charger is in use so you know if charging is happening. There's no need for a light for the ‌MagSafe‌ charging puck because the ‌iPhone‌ connects magnetically and automatically gets oriented in the right position.</p><p><img alt=\"belkin charger with airpods\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/LnwL60bJADLxJ3DzQBo97T8bFGE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/LnwL60bJADLxJ3DzQBo97T8bFGE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/LnwL60bJADLxJ3DzQBo97T8bFGE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ie9tfieUWgtHI3t47B6wAFmXncc=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/bVZ0eLtHO6jiX5Ygyv8rcu_VD2c=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/1274KtCM7RFCd0PS-uVAV3GnvDA=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/LnwL60bJADLxJ3DzQBo97T8bFGE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ie9tfieUWgtHI3t47B6wAFmXncc=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/bVZ0eLtHO6jiX5Ygyv8rcu_VD2c=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/1274KtCM7RFCd0PS-uVAV3GnvDA=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg 2500w\"><br>You can use the ‌MagSafe‌ charger with a naked ‌iPhone‌ or with a MagSafe-compatible case, but because it's magnetic, it does not work with non-MagSafe cases or with non-iPhone 12 models because they don't have the necessary built-in magnets.</p><p>In my testing, Belkin's 2-in-1 ‌MagSafe‌ Charger charged my ‌iPhone 12‌ from dead to 62 percent in an hour while also charging the ‌AirPods Pro‌ at 5W, which is just about the same charging speed that I tend to get from a standard Apple ‌MagSafe‌ Charger. It should be noted, though, that charging with ‌MagSafe‌ is variable, both with this Belkin charger and Apple's standard charger.</p><p>In some tests I get around 60 percent battery life in an hour from dead, but in other tests, battery life can be closer to 70 percent, so your actual charging speeds may vary somewhat. What I can say, though, is that the Belkin charger seems to be charging right at the same speeds as a standard ‌MagSafe‌ Charger, even when charging another device too.<br></p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Apple's standard ‌MagSafe‌ Charger is $39, which means the 2-in-1 ‌MagSafe‌ Charger from Belkin is $60 more expensive. Not everyone is going to want to pay that price, but for those who are fully investing in the ‌MagSafe‌ product lineup, it could be worth the cost.</p><p><img alt=\"belkin charger desktop\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Jr8clGjrI4qTSHo6bipz376xnzM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Jr8clGjrI4qTSHo6bipz376xnzM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Jr8clGjrI4qTSHo6bipz376xnzM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/yljzCj5WAo7amv7RNXYUN8V7H34=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Zq0AhyR-NWP-XvK-iu61zs2QuWM=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Dap3bLFBQCOAYrmVUGcWPQBXNQo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Jr8clGjrI4qTSHo6bipz376xnzM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/yljzCj5WAo7amv7RNXYUN8V7H34=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Zq0AhyR-NWP-XvK-iu61zs2QuWM=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Dap3bLFBQCOAYrmVUGcWPQBXNQo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg 2500w\"><br>I prefer Belkin's upright charging options to the standard Apple ‌MagSafe‌ Charger because they're just more convenient to use. It's easier to grab an ‌iPhone‌ off a desk from the charging arm than it is to grab one from the flat charger, and there's also space for charging ‌AirPods‌ or another device with the Qi charging base. All-in-one charging options save space and require fewer cables, which is a bonus.</p><p>In the future there may be more ‌MagSafe‌ charging options to choose from, but right now you're only going to get the fastest speeds from Apple-approved accessories like the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger and Belkin's options.
