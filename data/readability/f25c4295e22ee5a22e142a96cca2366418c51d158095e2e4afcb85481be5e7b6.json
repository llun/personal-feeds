AI has remained a key focus area for tech giants and growing competition to dominate the space has resulted in an acquisition spree among these companies.\"</p></blockquote><p>Many of Apple's acquisitions have been aimed at improving <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. Apple purchased <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/27/apple-buys-ai-startup-inductiv/\">Inductiv</a> to improve ‌Siri‌'s data, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/03/apple-acquires-ai-startup-voysis/\">Voysis</a> was acquired to improve ‌Siri‌'s understanding of natural language. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/15/apple-acquires-voice-app-startup-pullstring/\">PullString</a>, meanwhile, makes it easier for iOS developers to use ‌Siri‌ features in apps.</p><blockquote><p>\"Apple has gone on a shopping spree in efforts to catch up with Google (Google Assistant) and Amazon (Alexa). ‌Siri‌ was first on the market, but it consistently ranks below the two in terms of \"smartness\", which is partly why Apple is far behind in smart speaker sales. Apple also want to make sure to keep its strong position within wearables. It is the dominant player in smartwatches. The acquisition of Xnor.ai last year was made to improve its on-edge processing capabilities, which has become important as it eliminates the need for data to be sent to the cloud, thereby improving data privacy.\"</p></blockquote><p>Other acquisitions are aimed at future products, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/25/apple-acquires-self-driving-car-startup-drive-ai/\">like Drive.ai</a>, a self-driving startup that Apple purchased in 2019, presumably to further its autonomous car development project.</p><p>All of the above listed companies are also on an \"AI talent-hiring spree\" and collectively posted more than 14,000 jobs in the AI space in 2020.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">iPhone 13 Front Glass Reveals Smaller Notch With Earpiece Relocated to Top Bezel</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models are widely expected to feature a smaller notch, and we are able to share a first look at the potential design.
