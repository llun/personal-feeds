However, the company added that it was unclear how that could affect business in the long-run.</p><p>A handful of ad networks and companies have criticized Apple's decision, including Facebook, which ran <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/17/facebook-runs-apple-vs-free-internet-ad/\">full-page newspaper ads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/apple-ios-14-speak-up-for-small-business\">launched a website</a> claiming that Apple's tracking change will hurt small businesses financially.</p><p>But during an earnings call with analysts, Snap Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman reportedly struck a different tone, saying that Snap shares Apple's philosophy on protecting users' privacy.<br></p><blockquote><p>\"We admire Apple and believe they are trying to do the right thing for customers,\" Gorman said, adding Snap is well prepared to guide advertisers through the iOS changes.</p></blockquote><p>During the earnings call, Snap revealed that user growth and revenue beat analysts' fourth-quarter estimates. SnapChat made the biggest gains outside the U.S. and Europe, with 55% growth in daily active users. Revenue generated mainly from ad sales grew 62% to $911 million, easily surpassing Wall Street's consensus estimate of $857.4 million, reports <em>Reuters</em>.<br></p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/apple-car-kia-investment/\">Apple to Invest $3.6 Billion in Kia Motors for Apple Car Production</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 2, 2021 9:46 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple is rumored to be planning to invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors as part of a planned manufacturing partnership between the two companies, according to Korean site DongA Ilbo (via Bloomberg).
