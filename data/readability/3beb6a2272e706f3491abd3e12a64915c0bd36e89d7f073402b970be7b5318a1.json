When it does, it is very welcomed but puts a damper on my rides. I know, super spoiled. I have a trainer but only use it as a last resort. The day this was shot it had rained all night and morning and suddenly a couple hour window opened up then rain the rest of the day. It was beautiful ride.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
