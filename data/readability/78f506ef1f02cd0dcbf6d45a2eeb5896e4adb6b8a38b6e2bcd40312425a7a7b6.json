{"title":"Nacer Bouhanni is still a nightmare","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/nacer-bouhanni-is-still-a-terror/","date":1616980800000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>There aren’t many professional cyclists with a section titled “Incidents” on their Wikipedia page. Nacer Bouhanni has many incidents.</p><p>There was the time he hit Jack Bauer at the 2017 Tour de France. And the time he had to be physically separated from Rudy Barbier after Barbier won Paris-Bourges. Or the time he was accused of a “violent altercation” with his own director, Roberto Damiani, at Eschborn-Frankfurt. The list goes on.</p><p>There are only so many headlines one can write about fistfights and pugilism and a history as a boxer before you start to wonder if such things belong in bike racing.</p><p>On Sunday, Bouhanni was disqualified from the one-day Cholet-Pays de la Loire, won by Elia Viviani, after swinging hard from the right side of his leadout man to the far left, pinning Groupama-FDJ’s Jake Stewart against the barriers.</p><p>Stewart hit the barrier, leaned against it, but managed to keep it upright. He went from contesting the sprint to finishing in 29th.</p><p>Despite Bouhanni’s long list of “incidents,” the penalty for this latest dangerous move was a disqualification. The maneuver could very easily have resulted in a major crash.</p><p>This stands in stark contrast to the penalty for a nearly identical move from Dylan Groenewegen, which had far more disastrous consequences but was, at its core, not any worse than what Bouhanni did on Sunday.</p><p>The jury’s decision at Cholet-Pays de la Loire further amplifies the arbitrary feel of Groenewegen’s nine-month ban. Groenewegen’s maneuver at the Tour of Poland was no more (and possibly less) egregious, but the outcome was compounded by a complete failure of the barriers, resulting in a disastrous crash and horrible injuries. The disparity in penalty, given nearly identical transgressions, is jarring.</p><p>Under the current rules, the UCI clearly penalizes outcomes, not actions.</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"78f506ef1f02cd0dcbf6d45a2eeb5896e4adb6b8a38b6e2bcd40312425a7a7b6","category":"Cycling"}
