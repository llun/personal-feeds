It is not yet clear exactly when the cut-off date for created Shortcuts links is, but broadly, links created within the past week seem to be unaffected and continue to work correctly. Apple's own in-app gallery for downloading Shortcuts is also still working as expected.</p><p>When attempting to add a Shortcut from an affected ‌iCloud‌ link, users are now presented with an error message in the Shortcuts app that reads \"Shortcut Not Found: The shortcut link may be invalid, or it may have been deleted.\" The change has since been flagged by users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/mbou6h/shortcut_icloud_links_broken_right_now_for_anyone/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rodrigoaraujo/status/1374689829955497986?s=21\">Twitter</a>.</p><p>It is as yet unclear if the error is an intentional change on Apple's part, as it could have added an expiry period to the ‌iCloud‌ links to prevent them from working after a certain amount of time, or if it is simply a server-side error that has invalidated all links created prior to an internal change.</p><p>Either way, the fact that the majority of links to Shortcuts are now defunct is highly problematic for sites such as <em><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/\">MacStories</a></em> or the subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/\">r/shortcuts</a>, which are heavily reliant on ‌iCloud‌ links for sharing previously-created Shortcuts.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\">Apple Adds FaceTime Framework to Apple TV/HomePod Amid Speaker With Screen Rumors</a></h3><p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today revealed that Apple has been developing new speakers that are equipped with \"screens and cameras,\" suggesting we could see a future HomePod-like device that has a built-in display and camera feature for FaceTiming and other functions.
