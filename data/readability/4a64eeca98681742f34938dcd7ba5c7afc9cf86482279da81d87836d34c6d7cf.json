There are many ways to earn it, and even more ways to lose it. In this article, we’ll go through how you, as a product designer, can make sure your product nurtures and retains trust throughout every touchpoint. To do that, we’ll be borrowing some of the tricks marketers and product people have up their sleeves.</section></p><p>Building trust is one of the central goals of user experience design. And yet trust is a concept that’s very hard to define in a precise manner. We all know it when we feel it but often fall short of putting it in words. Being able to turn the elusive and intangible into actionable and concrete steps, however, is exactly <strong>what makes UX so crucial</strong> in the modern business ecosystem.</p><p>Although a product experience that is useful and coherent is what fundamentally builds a sense of security and satisfaction, there’s a lot more nuance that goes building it. That’s what this article is about. We’ll take a deeper dive into users’ trust and how we can use UX to build a lasting relationship with your clientele.</p><p>Instilling trust goes beyond the bare visuals of a product. Ideally, a UX designer’s work starts well before the first lines are drawn and long after designs are deployed.</p><p><strong>Being more present</strong> allows us to achieve a comprehensive view of the whole customer lifecycle, which also encourages us to borrow tools and approaches from marketers, product managers and developers. Being well-rounded in the product development activities is yet another aspect that we’ll advocate for throughout the piece. As a result of dabbling in non-design activities, we can gather an in-depth understanding of all areas where trust is vital.</p><h3 id=\"think-about-the-customer-journey\">Think About The Customer Journey</h3><p>A central competency of UX design is a good understanding of your users’ needs, preferences, and emotions. Therefore, overtime we, designers, need to develop a wide array of skills to improve our understanding of our users and their interaction with our products.</p><p>One such way entails using qualitative data and detailed analytics, which is vital in allowing us to outline a user’s persona’s most important qualities. Analytics can be used to create hypotheses and validate or discard them. As a result, you’ll be able to create experiences that will foster customer loyalty and a sustained sense of trust.</p><p>Let’s look into <strong>the stages of a customer journey</strong> and explore how UX designers can bring value to the table. You might also notice the way we suggest to structure the customer journey map is marketing-oriented. Such marketing-orientedness speaks to the purpose of this article: to give designers a broader perspective.</p><p>Below, we can see one such example of a customer journey that’s structured around the so-called “funnel” marketers and sales-people use:</p><ul><li><a href=\"#awareness\">Awareness</a></li><li><a href=\"#consideration\">Consideration</a></li><li><a href=\"#intent\">Intent</a></li><li><a href=\"#action\">Action</a></li><li><a href=\"#retention\">Retention</a></li></ul><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"example of a customer journey\"></a><figcaption>Designed by <a href=\"https://adamfard.com/\">Adam Fard UX Studio</a> (<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aaa14351-f2b0-4c39-a40c-784e1f9327dd/4-user-trust-ux-design.png\">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Below is the classic visualization of a <strong>sales/marketing funnel</strong>.

That’s exactly what we did with the <strong>customer journey map</strong> (CJM) below. This map was created for one of our projects a while ago, and was tweaked significantly to respect the client’s privacy. By focusing on the whole funnel, we were able to <strong>go beyond the product UI</strong>, and audit the whole UX from the very first users’ interaction with the product in question.</p><p>Now that we’ve talked briefly about how we can map users’ journey to pinpoint trust-sensitive areas, let’s move on to the first stage of the funnel: Awareness.</p><h3 id=\"awareness\">Awareness</h3><p>Awareness is the stage where we should analyze how customers learn about a product or service. When devising a strategy for this step, we need to start from our users’ problems and their most common pain points. Being user-centric enables us to think about the best ways to approach potential customers while they are trying to tackle a certain pain point. The goal here is to have a reserved and more educational tone.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01ee7188-7295-4a51-a646-866b330d9984/20-user-trust-ux-design.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"sales funnel\"></a><figcaption>Illustration by Adam Fard UX Studio.

For example, simple notepad is a competitor to productivity apps, as they solve the same problem: being on top of your tasks and staying productive. How does that help with trust and creating a CJM? It allows you to empathize and put yourself in the shoes of your users. Also, it helps your craft authentic and relatable messaging that resonates with people.</li><li><strong>Ensure that your analysis is consistent.</strong><br>It’s important to have a clear understanding of which aspects you’re going to analyze. Come up with analysis criteria, so that your notes are structured and easy to draw conclusions from.<br>Considering different options is almost always a part of a customer’s journey. You have to make it easy to understand how you’re better than the alternatives.</li><li><strong>Establish the best sources for your data.</strong><br>The best source is users: either yours or someone else’s. Period. But a few google searches would certainly do no harm.</li><li><strong>Define the best ways</strong> to incorporate your findings into your product at its inception.</li></ul><p>Studying your competition will provide you with a wealth of quantitative and qualitative data that will guide your business decisions. As a result, you’ll create a product that fits your users’ needs and instills trust and satisfaction.</p><h3 id=\"consideration-acquisition\">Consideration &amp; Acquisition</h3><p>Users that have made it to the consideration stage are interested in your product but aren’t prepared to become paying customers.

Here are a few of them:</p><h4 id=\"explain-how-your-algorithms-work\">Explain How Your Algorithms Work</h4><p>If your product revolves around AI/ML algorithms, to <a href=\"https://adamfard.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy\">enhance customer experience</a>, it’s important to explain how it works.</p><p>We’re typically very sensitive about our data. Respectively, there’s no reason to think that users will blindly trust a product’s AI. It’s our responsibility to counteract the distrust by explaining how it works and what kind of data it will use.</p><p>Here are a few great ways you can outline the AI’s functionality while also encouraging them to make their own informed decisions:</p><ul><li><strong>Calibrate Trust</strong><br>AI systems are based on stats and numbers, which means that they can’t replace rational human thought. Emphasize that your algorithm is skilled at giving suggestions, but users should make their own choices.</li><li><strong>Display Confidence Levels</strong><br>An essential aspect of the scientific approach is that there are no facts — there is only evidence. Make sure to communicate how confident your algorithm is of something to be true.</li><li><strong>Explain Algorithm Outputs</strong><br>The results of an analysis must be accompanied by a clear explanation thereof.</li></ul><h4 id=\"good-ux-ui\">Good UX &amp; UI</h4><p>A well-executed UI is at the crux of user trust.

We’ve almost reached the end. In order to help you consolidate everything in this article, let us try to recap its contents.</p><p><strong>Creating a successful product is all about building trust.</strong> Luckily, there are so many ways to improve a product’s trustworthiness through UX. However, it’s essential to make these practices consistent. Customers seek to interact with brands that can deliver great experience throughout all interactions and touchpoints.</p><p>One of the ways to account for each touch point is reconciling <strong>two journey mapping techniques</strong> — marketing &amp; sales funnel and customer journey map. The funnel allows us to go beyond the in-app experience that designers often are reluctant to do while a customer journey map provides empathy, structure and the depth of analysis.</p><p>Listing all of the ways to boost trustworthiness for each funnel stage would take another couple of pages, so a simple advice would do. <strong>Empathy is the key</strong> for getting in your users’ shoes and tackling their trust concerns. For a more concrete list of guidelines, scroll up and skim through the headers. That should jog your memory.</p><p>The bottom line is that we encourage you, dear reader, to shortlist the stages your users go through before actually becoming your users. Is there anything that might undermine your product’s trustworthiness? Is there anything you could improve and nudge a soon-to-be user in the right direction? Giving <strong>definitive answers</strong> to these questions and addressing them is a surefire for a better designed product.</p><h4><span>Further Reading</span> on SmashingMag:</h4><ul><li><a title=\"Read 'Quantitative Data Tools For UX Designers'\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/12/quantitative-data-tools-uxdesigners/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Quantitative Data Tools For UX Designers</a></li><li><a title=\"Read '5 Ways Google Analytics Helps Web Developers In UI/UX Design'\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/google-analytics-web-developers-ui-ux-design/\" rel=\"bookmark\">5 Ways Google Analytics Helps Web Developers In UI/UX Design</a></li><li><a title=\"Read 'The Importance Of Macro And Micro-Moment Design'\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/12/macro-micro-moment-design/\" rel=\"bookmark\">The Importance Of Macro And Micro-Moment Design</a></li><li><a title=\"Read 'How To Deliver A Successful UX Project In The Healthcare Sector'\" href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/successful-ux-project-healthcare-sector/\" rel=\"bookmark\">How To Deliver A Successful UX Project In The Healthcare Sector</a></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/logo/logo--red.png\" alt=\"Smashing Editorial\" width=\"35\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"> <span>(ah, vf, yk, il)</span></p></div></div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Articles on Smashing Magazine — For Web Designers And Developers","siteHash":"ab069ca35bf300e9db0da36f49701f66485a5b0d2db0471dfeee07cef6204939","entryHash":"4a64eeca98681742f34938dcd7ba5c7afc9cf86482279da81d87836d34c6d7cf","category":"Tech"}
