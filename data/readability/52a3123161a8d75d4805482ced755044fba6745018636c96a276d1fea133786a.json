href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/\">the new 800V electric vehicle architecture</a> that Hyundai Motor Group has been developing over in South Korea. In February, we saw the first of the new EVs to use E-GMP, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/this-crisp-looking-crossover-is-hyundais-next-ev-the-ioniq-5/\">the attractive Hyundai Ioniq 5 crossover</a> that goes into production later this year. And on Sunday, sister company Kia showed off the initial images of its first E-GMP machine ahead of a proper debut later this March.</p><p>It's called the EV6, and it's the first vehicle to use Kia's new <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gqrfx2GzOYE\">\"opposites united\"</a> design philosophy that the brand's press materials say takes inspiration \"from the contrasts found in nature and humanity.\"</p><p>\"With EV6 we aimed to create a distinctive, impactful design by using a combination of sophisticated, high-tech features on pure and rich volumes, while providing a unique space as a futuristic EV,\" said Karim Habib, SVP and head of Kia's global design center.</p><p>At the front, the \"tiger nose grille\" we've seen on Kias over the past few years gives way to a design it's calling Digital Tiger Face. When seen in profile, the EV6 is clearly a crossover—no surprise given that consumers want to buy them and that the form factor also leaves room to package a hefty lithium-ion battery pack under the cabin. It's a much less retro shape than the Ioniq 5 and is one that reminds me of the Lamborghini Urus as I look at the images Kia sent Ars.</p><p>Expect plenty of space on the inside—another advantage of EVs over vehicles that need to find somewhere to package an internal combustion powertrain. Kia isn't showing off much about the interior yet, but it does highlight the seamless curved display that combines the main instrument display and the infotainment system. We do know that Kia plans to use a greater mix of recycled and sustainable materials in the EV6's interior, though.</p><p>More detailed specs will have to wait until the official unveiling later this month, but it's reasonable to expect them to resemble those of the Ioniq 5.</p><p><em>Listing image by Kia</em></p></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
