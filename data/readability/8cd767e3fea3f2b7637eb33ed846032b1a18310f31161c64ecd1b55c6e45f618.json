href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/weve-driven-audis-first-proper-electric-car-the-2019-e-tron-suv/\">e-tron</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/audi-adds-a-dash-of-sportback-style-to-its-newest-e-tron-electric-car/\">e-tron Sportback</a> SUVs, Audi is adding a third battery EV to its lineup. On Tuesday, the company revealed the car to the world, with one of its now-traditional light shows, albeit by livestream rather than in front of an audience. It's called the e-tron GT, and it's a sleek four-door, four-seater that shares more than a little with the excellent electric Porsche Taycan.</p><h2>Spot the difference</h2><p>Audi has been showing off <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/audi-is-planning-20-all-electric-models-by-2025-heres-how-it-will-do-it/\">an e-tron GT concept since 2019</a>, and the production car differs very little from that show car, save for some sensors embedded in the front bodywork. The design language is very obviously Audi's, with hints of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/06/the-2019-audi-a7-might-be-all-the-car-anyone-ever-needs/\">A7 fastback</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/the-audi-r8-v10-performance-they-wont-make-them-like-this-much-longer/\">R8 supercar</a> depending on where you look. But aerodynamics have been at least as much a concern as curb appeal, as the drag coefficient is nice and low at 0.24.</p><p>The e-tron GT is built on the Taycan's J1 platform, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-porsches-new-electric-car/\">and so these specs may therefore look familiar</a>. The car is built around its 93.4kWh lithium-ion battery pack (total capacity, net, is believed to be 85kWh), and utilizes an 800V electrical architecture that allows it to DC fast charge at up to 270kW, which means, like the Taycan, you can go from 5 to 80 percent in 22.5 minutes. AC charging is at 11kW by default, with an optional 22kW onboard charger available shortly after launch. It's too soon for an EPA range estimate, but Audi says it should achieve 298 miles (488km) on the European WLTP cycle.</p><h2>e-tron GT Quattro and RS e-tron GT</h2><p>The battery feeds a pair of permanent magnet synchronous motors—one for the front axle and one for the rear, which, like the Taycan motor, uses a two-speed transmission. Thankfully, Audi isn't confusing us by calling its newest BEV a turbo. But there will be two versions at launch later this summer: the e-tron GT Quattro, which starts at $99,900 (before tax credits), and the $139,900 RS e-tron GT.</p><p>The e-tron GT Quattro has a nominal output of 470hp (350kW) and 465lb-ft (630Nm) but can boost to 523hp (390kW) for up to 2.5 seconds when using launch control. That should be sufficient to hit 60mph from a standstill in 3.9 seconds, with a speed limiter kicking in at 152mph (245km/h). The individual motors are rated at 235hp/175kW for the front axle and 430hp/320kW for the rear, and, as in the Taycan, they are able to regenerate the battery at up to 265kW.</p><p>The RS e-tron GT is Audi Sport's first BEV, and it promises to be as quick as the R8, which is built alongside it at Audi's Böllinger Höfe factory in Germany. It uses the same front motor as the Quattro&nbsp;but a more-powerful 450hp (335kW) rear drive unit to give a nominal output of 590hp (440kW) and 612lb-ft (830Nm). Launch control in the RS e-tron GT boosts power to 637hp (475kW) for up to 2.5 seconds, which gets the car to 60mph in 3.1 seconds. Top speed for this version is capped at 155mph (250km/h). It's not quite as powerful as the Porsche, but even the RS e-tron GT undercuts the Taycan Turbo by more than $10,000.</p><h2>Buttons are back, baby</h2><p>The interior layout will be familiar if you've sat in a Taycan, but surprisingly, Audi has gone for plenty of buttons and other physical controls instead of an all-touchscreen interface like the Porsche. Like its sibling, there's an animal-free interior as standard, which uses recycled materials for the seats, which can be trimmed with an artificial suede called Dinamica or a fabric called Kaskade. More traditional wood-and-leather interiors are just an options list away, and the cabin of the RS e-tron GT can be personalized or clad in as much carbon fiber as your wallet can stand.</p><p>It will be a while before we get to drive an e-tron GT. But given how much the Taycan impressed everyone who has driven one, I expect good things from this Audi.</p><p><em>Listing image by Audi</em></p></div></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
