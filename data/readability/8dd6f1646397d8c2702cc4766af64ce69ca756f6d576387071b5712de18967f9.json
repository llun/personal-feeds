The final tweet of the thread read; “for more consistency, I also request the cancellation of the arrival of Paris-Nice as scheduled.”</p><p>At the moment Nice is under strict weekend lockdown, as well as a 6 pm to 6 am curfew. Estrosi said he would like to allow citizens of Nice outside for three hours on the weekends, especially for physical activity. Currently, the time limit for leaving home is one hour. The request also includes opening the promenade to pedestrians and cyclists, which would clash with the finish or Paris-Nice.</p><p>The final stage of Paris-Nice is set to start along the 2020 Tour de France stage 2 route with the same finish where Julian Alaphillipe won early in the Tour last year. The Paris-Nice organizers already have an alternative finish planned, after they were forced to cancel the last stage in Nice in 2020, prior to the COVID-19 lockdowns across Europe.</p><p>Prudhomme told Het Nieuwsblad, “we are very hopeful that we will reach the French Riviera this time in Paris-Nice. The [COVID-19] figures in the Alpes Maritimes are moving in the right direction. We remain calm about it. If it turns out differently, we will adapt.”</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8dd6f1646397d8c2702cc4766af64ce69ca756f6d576387071b5712de18967f9","category":"Cycling"}
