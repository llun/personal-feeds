But while there's never been more people playing together, finding the best co-op games to play with a partner at home can still be tricky.

Below, we've rounded up 26 of the best couch co-op games we've played, with options that should appeal to both hardcore and less experienced players.

Its two-player mode isn't available until an hour or so into the story, but at that point the rest of the game becomes one of the most accessible co-op campaigns in recent memory.</p><p>If your partner isn't well-versed in typical game mechanics, they can control \"Gooigi,\" a Luigi clone made of green goo that has a lower health pool but infinite lives. This gives them the freedom to fool around and die repeatedly without forcing you both to restart levels and boss fights. The game isn't particularly difficult, and because Gooigi is an essential part of solving many of the game's puzzles, your partner won't feel like a mere accessory while you do all the work.</p><p><em>Luigi's Mansion 3</em> as a whole has issues: aiming your ghost-sucking vacuum can be frustratingly imprecise, and there are some tedious sequences that force you to backtrack through previously conquered levels for little added benefit. But even compared to other Nintendo games, this is a game with character, from Luigi's adorable looks of terror to the distinct designs of each hotel floor and ghost boss you meet. Barreling into a room with your \"Poltergust\" vacuums and sucking up everything in sight is both silly and consistently satisfying. Everything about the game looks gorgeous, like a playable Pixar movie. And because it's broken up into clearly defined levels, <em>Luigi's Mansion 3</em> is a game you can drop and revisit at your leisure.</p><h2><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/71gNKnqxosL._AC_SL1280_.jpg\" data-height=\"720\" data-width=\"1280\" alt=\"<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is more <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is good.\"><img alt=\"<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is more <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is good.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/71gNKnqxosL._AC_SL1280_-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/71gNKnqxosL._AC_SL1280_-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/71gNKnqxosL._AC_SL1280_.jpg\" data-height=\"720\" data-width=\"1280\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is more <em>Mario Kart</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is good.</p><p>Nintendo</p></figcaption></figure><div><div><div><p><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9113G9pfxzL._SL1500_-300x486.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe product image\"></p></div><h3>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe <span>[Switch]</span></h3></div><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div></div><p><em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/mario-kart-8-is-still-great-in-its-deluxe-switch-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em> is a 4-year-old upgrade for a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mario-kart-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7-year-old Wii U game</a>, but it's <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo's best-selling Switch title</a> for a reason: it's inviting to players of all experience levels, both in how it plays and how it presents itself.

The blue shell remains one of gaming's most fearsome equalizers.</p><p><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is an iteration at its core, but its selection of courses is among the series' most charming. The layouts are diverse enough to keep each race from feeling too similar. Every track is stuffed with enough personality to make simply driving around and looking at the scenery a joy. The same goes for the cast of Nintendo characters, who are as expressive and lovable as ever. (Except you, <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Metal_Mario_(character)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metal Mario</a>, you weirdo.) By this point, Nintendo has solved the science required to make driving a video game kart at high speeds as smooth as possible.</p><p>On top of all that, there are genuinely useful accessibility features for kart-racing newbies, including a \"smart steering\" assist that helps keep you from smashing into guardrails. It's also possible (if not ideal) to play in split-screen using one set of Joy-Con controllers. In any case, people have been bonding over rounds of <em>Mario Kart</em> for nearly three decades, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> gives them no reason to stop.</p><h2><em>Overcooked! 2</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/91DCnX0JB8L._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" data-height=\"844\" data-width=\"1500\" alt=\"<em>Overcooked! 2</em> will have you channeling your inner Gordon Ramsay.\"><img alt=\"<em>Overcooked! 2</em> will have you channeling your inner Gordon Ramsay.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/91DCnX0JB8L._AC_SL1500_-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/91DCnX0JB8L._AC_SL1500_-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/91DCnX0JB8L._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" data-height=\"844\" data-width=\"1500\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Overcooked! 2</em> will have you channeling your inner Gordon Ramsay.</p><p>Team17 Digital</p></figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/overcooked-2-puts-some-icing-on-the-originals-delicious-co-op-cake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Overcooked! 2</em></a> situates you and up to three partners as chefs tasked with preparing many different meals. Conceptually, this is simple: you merely have to grab the correct ingredients from the kitchen, cook or chop them as needed, put everything together, then send the dish off. But the game puts each meal on a timer. Then more orders start rolling in. Then you need to wash the dirty plates before anything else can go out. Then parts of the levels start moving around. Then some of the food catches fire. Also, you can fall into bottomless chasms. Or get hit by a car.</p><p>The result is a series of mad scrambles that thoroughly test your ability to communicate under increasingly heavy layers of pressure. There's a good chance you and your partner will go <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV3_UHG73oQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full Gordon Ramsay</a> on one another if you play long enough without a break.</p><p><em>Overcooked! 2</em> knows exactly how devilish it is, but there's a fun blend of relief and accomplishment that comes with turning yourself and your partner into a less-than-well-oiled kitchen machine and surviving a particularly chaotic level. That the game's \"playable anxiety dream\" systems are masked beneath such an adorable, inviting aesthetic—complete with a thin yet cutesy plot about fending off a horde of zombie bread called the \"Unbread\"— makes the experience all the more comical. Just try not to take the emotions generated here into your actual kitchen.</p><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><h2><em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Switch_LoversDangerousSpacetime_03.jpg\" data-height=\"419\" data-width=\"745\" alt=\"<em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em>.\"><img alt=\"<em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em>.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Switch_LoversDangerousSpacetime_03-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Switch_LoversDangerousSpacetime_03.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Switch_LoversDangerousSpacetime_03.jpg\" data-height=\"419\" data-width=\"745\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em>.</p><p>Asteroid Base</p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em> is a space-based game as exciting as it is adorable. The setup: the forces of Anti-Love threaten the universe, so you and up to three partners must navigate the mazes of the galaxy in a neon battleship that you collectively control. While one person steers the ship, the others must defend it using weapons, shields, and other technology, hopping from control base to control base within.</p><p>As you complete the various stages—all of which are randomized, so you'll always be exploring unknown territory—you're tasked with rescuing space bunnies, battling baddies, and avoiding rock formations that could damage your ship.</p><p>The premise of <em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em> is fitting for couples: you and your partner must communicate to navigate your shared ship, and each player must perform equally important duties to make it through successfully. We recommend going into the game blind if possible, as it forces you both to learn the mechanics and to get your \"space legs\" simultaneously. Letting go of total individual control means that circumstances can get hectic, but navigating the ship, both inside and out, rarely feels unintuitive. This is a refreshing change of pace from the many co-op games that lean more heavily into our competitive natures—and a delightful way to spend quality time working together.</p><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><h2><em>Clubhouse Games</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/clubhouse-games.jpg\" data-height=\"844\" data-width=\"1500\" alt=\"<em>Clubhouse Games</em> is a fabulous collection of familiar favorites.\"><img alt=\"<em>Clubhouse Games</em> is a fabulous collection of familiar favorites.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/clubhouse-games-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/clubhouse-games-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/clubhouse-games.jpg\" data-height=\"844\" data-width=\"1500\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Clubhouse Games</em> is a fabulous collection of familiar favorites.</p><p>Nintendo</p></figcaption></figure><div><div><div><p><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/71kbTeui1pL._SL1500_-300x486.jpg\" alt=\"Clubhouse Games product image\"></p></div><h3>Clubhouse Games <span>[Switch]</span></h3></div><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/clubhouse-games-review-the-switchs-best-kids-in-a-backseat-compilation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Clubhouse Games</em></a> is a collection of 51 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-DsOVUYxXw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">classic board and card games</a> in digital form, ranging from checkers, <em>Yahtzee</em>, and backgammon to shogi, nine men's morris, and gomoku.

Some are about physical dexterity; others are about mental foresight.</p><p>The selection includes games from a variety of cultures and periods, and you'll frequently see tidbits of information about each game's origins and history.

It doesn't have much in the way of originality, but it's a super cute dungeon crawler built to be played with a buddy (or three). It's also wholly committed to accessibility: the controls are undemanding, the plot is uncomplicated, the character upgrade system isn't overwhelming, the randomly generated levels are largely linear, and the difficulty can be set as high or low as you and your partner like.</p><p>It's almost the polar opposite of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/minecraft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Minecraft</em></a> proper, and <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em> realizes the simple pleasures in bopping baddies, collecting loot, and making the numbers on your little adventurer go up. It makes all of those aspects of gaming <em>feel good</em>, and satisfaction is the point here—aided by an amusing array of wacky abilities and level features. If you've ever wanted to summon a llama to help you in battle, look no further.</p><p>The flipside of <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em>' simplicity is that it's not the deepest game around. But Mojang has done well to support the game with new content since launch, and what's here should be wholesome fun for those who want a dungeon crawler without the usual set of barriers to overcome.

This is a management sim not unlike <em>Stardew Valley</em> or <em>Animal Crossing</em>, albeit from a 2D perspective and with some light platforming elements. Player one takes the role of Stella, a young woman suddenly tasked with the duties of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charon</a>, the mythological Greek figure who ferries newly deceased souls to the afterlife. You sail the seas on a large boat, crafting and gathering resources to help you craft and gather more resources, all to comfort the various spirits you meet until they're ready to pass on.</p><p>When a second player joins in, they play as Stella's <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/972660/discussions/0/2521401367309854862/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tomcat</a>, Daffodil. He can't talk to NPCs or turn in quests, but he's otherwise right with you for the adventure and can be a big help during platforming bits. And yes, you can pet Daffodil.</p><p><em>Spiritfarer</em> is a game about death, so it is sad. But it's grounded, not manipulative. There's a heartwarming quality to it, since it's about care as much as it is grief. Plus, on a more immediate level, it's gorgeously animated.</p><p>Like many management sims, <em>Spiritfarer</em>'s density of tasks and systems can occasionally feel overwhelming. It's probably not something you'd binge for hours at a time. And there's a nonzero chance it'll bring you to tears. But there's beauty in it, the kind that's worth sharing with a partner.</p><h2><em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/817Fxjm6Y4L._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" data-height=\"844\" data-width=\"1500\" alt=\"<em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em> is gorgeous even with the Switch's technical limitations.\"><img alt=\"<em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em> is gorgeous even with the Switch's technical limitations.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/817Fxjm6Y4L._AC_SL1500_-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/817Fxjm6Y4L._AC_SL1500_-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/817Fxjm6Y4L._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" data-height=\"844\" data-width=\"1500\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em> is gorgeous even with the Switch's technical limitations.</p><p>Nintendo</p></figcaption></figure><div><div><div><p><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/71NA35U5L3L._SL1000_-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze product image\"></p></div><h3>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze <span>[Switch]</span></h3></div><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div></div><p>Like most <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> games, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-brings-an-old-school-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</em></a> is a structurally straightforward side-scrolling platformer made worthwhile by gorgeous aesthetics and the just-right feel of the Kong family's movement. Its main appeal lies in discovering where it'll take you next; oftentimes, you're thrown into multiple distinct scene-scapes within a single level. Each is as stunning as the last.</p><p>The platforming here isn't anything revolutionary, but it's precise and professional. The game can get difficult at times, particularly during later boss fights. (The fact that co-op players share total lives increases that difficulty slightly.) If that sounds daunting to your partner, the Switch version includes an \"easy mode\" that lets them play as Funky Kong, who has more leeway to take damage and essentially rolls the abilities of the other Kongs in the game into one character. He's also a monkey who wears sunglasses and rides a surfboard.

It is absolutely stunning to look at. In both visual and audio design, this is the closest any game has come to being a playable animated short from the 1930s. Its premise—you're a pair of anthropomorphic cups reluctantly collecting \"soul contracts\" for the literal Devil—somehow fits that aesthetic perfectly. But, wow, can it be brutal. This is a 2D run-and-gun game with several tricky (and inventive) boss fights that require special levels of concentration.</p><p><em>Cuphead</em> actually becomes <em>harder</em> in co-op, since bosses have more health, and having both Cuphead and his buddy Mugman onscreen can distract from your focus. But like all good \"difficult games,\" it rarely feels cheap, so conquering each battle brings a pleasant catharsis.

That means it still plays like a polished version of a great game from 1988.</p><p>That also means <em>Spelunky 2</em> is enormously difficult. But it's (mostly) fair in that your many deaths will usually come from your own lack of discipline. Like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/dark-souls/\"><em>Dark Souls</em></a>, it's a game where failure is the point: it helps you learn and eventually (maybe? hopefully?) progress. Meanwhile, the procedurally generated levels and new diverging paths give each run a sense of freshness that does not exist in many other platformers.</p><p><em>Spelunky 2</em>'s local co-op can feel somewhat tacked on. Up to four players can play at once, but everyone must always remain in view of \"player one,\" with no option for a zoomed-out or split-screen perspective. (If you play with friends online, however, these restrictions are lifted.) That said, having a buddy to revive you can make the game a little more bearable, and it's still possible to unlock shortcuts to later levels. <em>Spelunky 2</em> is not for the faint of heart, but if you and your partner can work through the pain, it might bring you closer together.</p><h2><em>River City Girls</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/river-city-girls.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\" alt=\"<em>River City Girls</em> is a refreshing take on the old-school beat 'em up.\"><img alt=\"<em>River City Girls</em> is a refreshing take on the old-school beat 'em up.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/river-city-girls-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/river-city-girls-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/river-city-girls.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>River City Girls</em> is a refreshing take on the old-school beat 'em up.</p><p>WayForward, Arc System Works</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><p><em>River City Girls</em> is well worth a look for any couple in the mood for an old-fashioned brawler. Like genre classic <em>River City Ransom</em>, <em>River City Girls</em> has you beating the tar out of fools across a nonlinear 2D city. Combat has a satisfying sense of impact, and there are lite RPG elements that allow you to learn new moves, equip accessories, and earn stat boosts on top of your initial light, heavy, throw, jumping, and running attacks.</p><p>Unlike most games in the <em>River City</em> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunio-kun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">or <em>Kunio-kun</em></a>) series, <em>River City Girls</em> turns the franchise's usual heroes, Kunio and Riki, into the kidnapped. You play as their girlfriends, Kyoko and Misako, who are utterly pissed about it and ready to pummel whoever snatched the boys. The narrative gives this subversion with just the right amount of playfulness, and most bits of writing between battles set the tone well. The anime-style cutscenes may not appeal to everyone, but the moment-to-moment sprite work looks wonderful, the voice acting is sound, and the pop-heavy soundtrack is a treat.</p><p>Since the single-player mode doesn't let the CPU control a second character, <em>River City Girls</em> is also best experienced in co-op. The game isn't easy, but the penalty for death isn't harsh (some lost money), and the game autosaves every time you enter a new screen. And while the brawling can get repetitive at points, that's an issue that tends to plague most beat 'em ups. All told, <em>River City Girls</em> offers a welcome mix of fresh flair and familiar comfort.</p><h2><em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_3e46be583b26233f133c705bc6c920d204cbd1a1.1920x1080.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\" alt=\"Some classic multiplayer mayhem in <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>.\"><img alt=\"Some classic multiplayer mayhem in <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_3e46be583b26233f133c705bc6c920d204cbd1a1.1920x1080-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_3e46be583b26233f133c705bc6c920d204cbd1a1.1920x1080-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_3e46be583b26233f133c705bc6c920d204cbd1a1.1920x1080.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Some classic multiplayer mayhem in <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>.</p><p>343 Industries</p></figcaption></figure><div><div><div><p><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/71ripjSsxiL._SL1500_-300x419.jpg\" alt=\"Halo: The Master Chief Collection product image\"></p></div><h3>Halo: The Master Chief Collection <span>[Xbox]</span></h3></div><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div></div><p>If you or your partner were at all into first-person shooters or online gaming in the 2000s, there's a good chance one of you has fond memories of flying Banshees, playing Grifball, and energy sword-ing grunts in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/halo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Halo</em></a>.

Or you can head into multiplayer and goof around there. (Just make sure you both have Xbox Live accounts.)

It tasks you both with defusing a series of ticking time bombs which can only be stopped by solving a series of puzzles strewn across modules on the bomb itself.

You and up to three others play as cutesy androids tasked with mowing down waves of robot baddies on a space freighter held hostage by rogue AIs. The narrative is light, but the game commits to its campy sci-fi cartoon aesthetic. Each of the nine available androids (four of which are unlocked by default) has charm—and abilities that genuinely change how you might attack a given stage.</p><p>Where <em>Assault Android Cactus</em> shines is in the way it heightens the intensity of a typical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shmup</a>. While your heroes have life bars, the penalty for dying isn't severe. The real worry is the fact that each android runs on a continuously depleting battery located at the top of the screen. Defeated enemies will drop partial battery recharges alongside various power-ups, but only one will appear onscreen at a time—and it will disappear if you don't collect it quickly. If the battery runs out, your android falls, and the mission fails.</p><p>This creates a frantic race against time that implores you to play aggressively. You have to move with grace and think about what you're doing—particularly in co-op, where the enemy count rises and the interplay between android abilities can affect your approach—but you have no time to strategize. Each stage only lasts for a few minutes, but the action is nonstop; each level becomes a sensory maelstrom of gunfire, enemy hordes, and power-up pings. It's a rush, and it's amplified by levels that frequently shift and surprise.</p><p>The main campaign only lasts a few hours, but there's pleasure in chasing S-ranks in subsequent playthroughs. Less experienced players who own the game's \"Plus\" version on PC or Switch, meanwhile, can turn on \"automatic aiming\" and \"revive\" features to simplify matters while they get their feet wet. However you play, this is an inventive and engaging take on an often-derivative genre.</p><h2><em>What the Golf?</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-golf.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\" alt=\"<em>What the Golf?</em> is an absurdist &quot;anti-golf&quot; game.\"><img alt=\"<em>What the Golf?</em> is an absurdist &quot;anti-golf&quot; game.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-golf-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-golf-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-golf.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>What the Golf?</em> is an absurdist \"anti-golf\" game.</p><p>Triband</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><p><em>What the Golf?</em> is something like a golf-themed take on an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_(series)#WarioWare_series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">old <em>WarioWare</em> game</a>. It bills itself as a \"golf game for people who hate golf,\" and that's about right: instead of worrying about club selection or the nuances of the green, <em>What the Golf?</em>'s dozens of micro-levels present a series of increasingly absurd jokes, all centered on the idea of getting an object from point A to point B.</p><p>Eventually, you wind up flinging not just golf balls but soccer balls, office chairs, small houses, people, and even the power meter used to determine the strength of your shot.

The levels are fast enough to give that \"just one more\" feeling, and the whole game is brief enough to not overstay its welcome.</p><p>Co-op play comes in the form of a \"party mode\" on PC and Switch (not on Apple Arcade, sadly) that pits two players against each other across a number of micro-levels, culminating in a final arena battle showdown.

(As someone who has dealt with shoddy movers, I can empathize with whatever unresolved trauma the creators of this game must have had.)</p><p>The way your little movers navigate and interact with objects is somewhat janky, but that also adds to the sense of wackiness <em>Moving Out</em> is going for. You start off packing up basic homes before moving onto places that are…very much not those. There are fart jokes. It's all lighthearted.</p><p><em>Overcooked</em> would <em>appear</em> to be a point of comparison, but <em>Moving Out</em> isn't quite so tense. While you may have trouble getting an L-shaped couch out the front door, going for top-ranked times is entirely optional. There are several assists to lower the game's difficulty, too, from making objects lighter to removing the need to pack items into the moving truck altogether. Again, what you see is generally what you get, but there are worse ways to spend a couple weekends than trashing digital houses with a buddy.</p><h2><em>Human: Fall Flat</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_fd273bcfc252363b0d1af710c9a273df228c900a.1920x1080.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\" alt=\"In <em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, you are a sort-of human who will frequently fall flat.\"><img alt=\"In <em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, you are a sort-of human who will frequently fall flat.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_fd273bcfc252363b0d1af710c9a273df228c900a.1920x1080-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_fd273bcfc252363b0d1af710c9a273df228c900a.1920x1080-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ss_fd273bcfc252363b0d1af710c9a273df228c900a.1920x1080.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> In <em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, you are a sort-of human who will frequently fall flat.</p><p>No Brakes Games</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><p><em>Human: Fall Flat</em> can feel like an experiment as much as a fully realized product at times, but it's almost fundamentally funny, and its slapstick is only amplified when played with another person. Like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/catching-up-with-some-of-the-most-interesting-indie-games-of-2014-so-far/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Octodad</em></a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/push-me-pull-you-and-the-other-modern-4p-couch-games-you-should-be-playing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Gang Beasts</em></a> before it, much of its humor comes from its deliberately wonky movement and physics. Simply getting your rubber-limbed avatar—known as \"Bob\"—from point A to point B provides a sense of accomplishment; when you manage to bumble him through the increasingly complex puzzles the game throws at you, that sense is multiplied.</p><p><em>Human: Fall Flat</em> takes the sandbox approach to platformer design. Each level has an end goal to reach, but there's a tremendous amount of freedom in how you get there, and there's no way to outright \"fail\" in between. (The game will drop optional hints if you get stuck for an excessive amount of time.) It's totally possible to finish the game on your own, but playing with a partner greatly heightens the level of experimentation you can pull off. There's an \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2uHBhKTSe0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apes hitting computer</a>\" sort of humor to watching two wobbly fools desperately try to swing themselves over a barricade or to catapult each other through a brick wall.</p><p>There's a bit of a learning curve to <em>Human: Fall Flat</em>'s physics, and the way the game drops you right into its madness might require some patience. Tying some of the more fundamental movements to the camera controls makes the game <em>look</em> appropriately chaotic but can also complicate otherwise straightforward solutions. Your first run will likely take 4-5 hours to complete; if you know what you're doing, it's technically possible to beat the entire game in less than 10 minutes, so this might be one to grab when it's on sale. Still, it should give you and your partner a few genuine laughs.</p><h2><em>Heave Ho</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heave-ho.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\" alt=\"<em>Heave Ho</em> is deceptively simple chaos.\"><img alt=\"<em>Heave Ho</em> is deceptively simple chaos.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heave-ho-640x360.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heave-ho-1280x720.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heave-ho.jpg\" data-height=\"1080\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Heave Ho</em> is deceptively simple chaos.</p><p>Devolver Digital</p></figcaption></figure><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><p>Continuing on the slapstick beat, <em>Heave Ho</em> is a platforming party game that simply asks you to reach an end goal. The catch is that you're only able to control your <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Geodude_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Geodude</a>-looking avatar's arms, which leads to many moments of you desperately hurtling yourself across a chasm without having total control of what you're doing.</p><p>This is amusing enough when playing on your own, but <em>Heave Ho</em> is significantly more entertaining with friends, preferably with a full party of four. In that case, you and your partners can grip onto <em>each other</em>, opening up several opportunities for traversal or—let's just be honest with ourselves—trolling. Trying to coordinate the momentum and timing required to swing your combined limbs like a rope, without being entirely sure of whose limbs are keeping the chain together, is a beautiful mess. Respawns are almost instantaneous, which only encourages goofing around.</p><p>That's about all <em>Heave Ho</em> has going on, but at $10, it's a good value for those interested in some dumb fun.</p><h2><em>Diablo III</em></h2><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/81JtkS1h1rL._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" data-height=\"938\" data-width=\"1500\" alt=\"<em>Diablo III</em> has lots of loot for you to plunder.\"><img alt=\"<em>Diablo III</em> has lots of loot for you to plunder.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/81JtkS1h1rL._AC_SL1500_-640x400.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/81JtkS1h1rL._AC_SL1500_-1280x800.jpg 2x\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/81JtkS1h1rL._AC_SL1500_.jpg\" data-height=\"938\" data-width=\"1500\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Diablo III</em> has lots of loot for you to plunder.</p><p>Blizzard</p></figcaption></figure><p>Lots of <em>Diablo</em> fans have Strong Opinions™ over <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/diablo-iii-leads-our-list-of-older-games-born-anew-on-nintendo-switch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Diablo III</em></a>'s place in the series, but in its current state, it's a decidedly satisfying and smooth-playing dungeon crawler. Those new to action-RPGs may find all the upgrade and item-management systems overwhelming at first, but it's ultimately more welcoming and forgiving than most games of this type. In no time at all, <em>Diablo III</em> will be channeling the part of your lizard brain that likes hacking down enemies, grabbing loot, and watching stat numbers grow.</p><p>Then it will coax you into spending hours min-maxing different character builds and running Rifts. Being unable to access your respective menus simultaneously is a pain, and the endgame can start to feel repetitive after a while, but give it a spin and <em>Diablo III</em> might sink its claws deeper than you might expect.

It requires more consideration on a moment-to-moment basis than a hack-and-slasher like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/diablo/\"><em>Diablo</em></a>, and its turn-based combat is frankly intimidating in how little it holds your hand. As you figure out its complexities, though, you (generally) feel more agency over your triumphs than you might in other modern RPGs. The whole sprawling story can be played with a partner, and it does the novel thing of actually addressing \"player two\" in the script instead of ignoring them altogether. It's a tremendously well-written game, too.</p><p>One caveat here is that you probably want to be living with your partner before taking on <em>Divinity</em>, as it could take more than 100 hours to do everything you want before wrapping up. Another caveat is that local co-op is unavailable on the Nintendo Switch copy of the game. Still, this is one for those hardcore CRPG fans that look lovingly at the <em>Baldur's Gate</em>s and <em>Ultima</em>s of years past. It's also compelling enough to be many people's starting point in the genre.</p><div><p>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</p></div><h2><em>Portal 2</em></h2><figure><img alt=\"<em>Portal 2</em> will force you and your partner to think a little harder.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portalcoop.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"><figcaption><p><em>Portal 2</em> will force you and your partner to think a little harder.</p><p>Valve</p></figcaption></figure><p>Though <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/a-silent-friendship-adventures-in-portal-2s-co-op-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Portal 2</em></a> is nearly a decade old, those who never managed to give it a shot will find that it has aged gracefully.
