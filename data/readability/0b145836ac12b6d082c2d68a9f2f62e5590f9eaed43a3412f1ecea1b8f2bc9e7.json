It does require a subscription for video storage, though.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat-with-voice-control/\">Ecobee Smart Thermostat with Voice Control</a></strong> ($250) - This is Ecobee's top of the line Smart Thermostat, which learns and adapts to your schedule to keep your home at a comfortable temperature at all times.
