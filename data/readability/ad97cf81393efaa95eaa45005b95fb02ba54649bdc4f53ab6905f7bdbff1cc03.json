Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-seeking-engineers-work-on-6g/\">believed to</a> have begun work on next-generation 6G wireless technologies.</p><p>With Apple seeking to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-developing-modem-in-house/\">move away</a> from reliance on other companies for wireless technologies, it is unclear how a deal with Huawei may pan out. Though Apple could take advantage of Huawei's expansive portfolio of 5G patents to develop its own wireless technologies, the company's apparent desire for independence in this area may mire the chances of a sustainable long-term agreement.</p><p><small>Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/political-news.218/\">Political News</a> forum.
