To check which version of iOS you’re running, go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</em>.</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by Macworld's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><p>Once your iPhone is in order, you’ll need to link a credit or debit card to use for payments. If you already have a card linked to your Apple ID for making iTunes and App Store purchases, you can opt to keep using that card with Apple Pay—you’ll just have to re-enter the card’s security code so Apple knows you’re legit. Take note: Some banks will add an extra layer of security to this step, asking you to enter a code they send to you via text, so that they too know you’re on the up-and-up.</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-pay-setup-100735216-large.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Apple</div>apple pay setup\"><img alt=\"apple pay setup\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" data-imageid=\"100735216\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-pay-setup-100735216-medium.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-pay-setup-100735216-medium.jpg\"></a><small>Apple</small></figure><p>You can also add additional cards—just launch Wallet and tap + in the top-right corner. You’ll then be prompted to add either a credit or debit card to use with Apple Pay or another pass to store in Wallet. Tap&nbsp;<em>Add Another Card</em>, then follow the entry fields on the next screen. You can speed this up by taking a picture of your card with your iPhone.</p><p>Whether you’re using the card already linked to your Apple ID or adding a new one, your iPhone will guide you through the setup process, which includes verifying your card, granting Apple Pay access, and then storing it in Wallet. Be sure to have your card handy so you can verify the card with its security code.</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-wallet-add-card-100735218-large.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Apple</div>apple wallet add card\"><img alt=\"apple wallet add card\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" data-imageid=\"100735218\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-wallet-add-card-100735218-medium.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-wallet-add-card-100735218-medium.jpg\"></a><small>Apple</small></figure><p>The card linked to your Apple ID will be listed as your default Apple Pay card, but you can always change that by going to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</em>&nbsp;and updating your transaction default information—or do it in the Wallet app by selecting your default card, choosing the overflow button (...) in the upper right corner, and changing the details from there.</p><p>You can also tweak your transaction settings (like your shipping and billing addresses), allow Apple Pay payments from your Mac (more on that in a bit), and allow you to start an Apple Pay transactions by double-pressing the Home button or double-pressing the Side button on iPhones equipped with Face ID, all from Settings.</p><h2 id=\"toc-2\">Apple Pay on the Apple Watch</h2><p>To set up Apple Pay on your Apple Watch, you’ll use the Watch app for iPhone. In the My Watch tab, scroll down to&nbsp;<em>Wallet &amp; Apple Pay</em>. In that section, you can mirror the alerts that show on your iPhone, or choose&nbsp;<em>Custom</em>&nbsp;and elect to have alerts come to your watch or not.</p><p>If you are already using Apple Pay on your iPhone, your cards should automatically sync up to use with your Apple Watch. If not, you can add cards again much like you would from Wallet, just follow your iPhone’s prompts.</p><p>Once you’re set up, you can find your debit/credit cards in the Wallet app on the watch, but it’s much faster to use the shortcut. Just double-press the side button (beneath the Digital Crown). This will bring up your default Apple Pay card, with your other cards available too if you’d like to select a different one (just swipe left or right).</p><h2 id=\"toc-3\">Apple Pay on the Mac</h2><p>If your Mac is running&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3083346/os-x/macos-sierra-faq-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-mac-operating-system.html\">macOS Sierra</a>&nbsp;or later, you can use Apple Pay to complete online purchases via Safari.&nbsp;However, unless you have a newer&nbsp;MacBook&nbsp;with Touch ID, you can’t just use Safari alone—you’ll need to use an Apple Pay-compatible iPhone or iPad (running iOS 10 or later) or Apple Watch (running watchOS 3 or later) to verify any transactions. You’ll also have to use the same iCloud account across devices.</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_29d34ee2085d6d77fbbe9a70d4f8a41d\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01eybrrgp2avk4z6f8htbb4baw\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-pay-mac1-100735219-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Macworld UK</div>\n<p>If you have a MacBook with Touch ID you can easily use Apple Pay.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"apple pay mac1\" width=\"700\" height=\"372\" data-imageid=\"100735219\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-pay-mac1-100735219-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/09/apple-pay-mac1-100735219-large.jpg\"></a><small>Macworld UK</small><figcaption><p>If you have a MacBook with Touch ID you can easily use Apple Pay.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once your iPhone and/or Apple Watch are ready to roll, using Apple Pay on your Mac is super simple—just look for the Apple Pay button at checkout on supported sites, select it, and follow the prompt.

These sensors are the same ones&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2607181/why-apple-pay-could-be-the-mobile-payment-system-youll-actually-use.html\">you’ve already seen in stores</a>, often equipped with both card swipers and a tap-to-pay contactless terminal. The beauty of Apple Pay is that you don’t even need to wake up your device or launch Wallet—your phone wakes up automatically when it gets in range of the terminal and initiates the payment process.</p><p>The easiest way to make a purchase with a modern iPhone (one with Face ID and no Home button) is to start by double-clicking the side button while looking at your phone. This will wake it up and launch Wallet, while authorizing you with Face ID. Then simply tap your iPhone to the terminal to complete the purchase.</p><p>If you’re&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2919859/how-to-use-apple-pay-on-the-apple-watch.html\">buying something with your Apple Watch</a>,&nbsp;double-press the button underneath the Digital Crown. Pressing twice will bring up your default Apple Pay card, with your other cards available too if you’d like to select a different one.</p><p>Once you pick the card you want to use, you’ll just hold your Watch close to the contactless payment terminal until you hear a beep and/or feel a vibration. It helps if you turn the Watch face toward the payment terminal, almost smooshing them together like they’re kissing. So you typically can’t see the watch’s face while the payment is happening, unlike when using Apple Pay on an iPhone, where the screen is typically facing you.</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_41dd7504ea1781ef9e975d588c47fc53\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01eybrrgp2avk4z6f8htbb4baw\"><a href=\"https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/apple_watch_apple_pay-100583879-orig.jpg\" title=\"apple watch apple pay\"><img alt=\"apple watch apple pay\" width=\"580\" height=\"388\" data-original=\"https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/apple_watch_apple_pay-100583879-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/05/apple_watch_apple_pay-100583879-large.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Depending on the retailer, the card you’re using, and the value of your purchase, you might need to enter your PIN.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"toc-5\">How to use Apple Pay in apps and online stores</h2><p>If you’re buying something through a partnered online store or app on your iPhone or iPad, you’ll just use Face ID/Touch ID to complete the purchase.
