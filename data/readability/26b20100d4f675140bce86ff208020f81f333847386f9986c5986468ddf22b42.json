Personal publishing gets the HEY treatment. Write something wonderful to the World Wide Web today at world@hey.com.</span></p><p><span>It’s 2021, and setting up a blog and email newsletter is still <em>way too hard</em>. You either have to set up a website which is <em>a whole thing</em>, or use a separate service that’s expensive, cumbersome, bloated, or all of the above.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, sending an email is <em>easy</em>. Fill in the address, type up your missive, press send. That’s when it occurred to us; you can email one person, a few people, or even an entire company. Why can’t you just email the web? Why do we have to do this whole separate thing to just put words on the internet? <strong>With HEY World, you don’t. Here’s how it works:</strong></span></p><h2>to: world@hey.com</h2><p>If you’re a HEY for You customer, start a new email, and put “world@hey.com” in the “to” field. The glow is how you know you’re writing to the world.</p><figure><img data-aos=\"world-glow\" width=\"1800\" height=\"959\" src=\"https://hey.com/assets/world/step1.png\" srcset=\"https://hey.com/assets/world/step1-900.png 900w, https://hey.com/assets/world/step1.png 1800w\" alt=\"addressing an email to the world in HEY\" loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption><span>address an email<br>to world@hey.com</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Write + Send = Posted</span></h2><p>Write your email just like any other email in HEY.
