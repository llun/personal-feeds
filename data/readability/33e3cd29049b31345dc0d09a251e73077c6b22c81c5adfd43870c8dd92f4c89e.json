Roglic was one of the day’s earliest starters, and he set a blistering time of 17:17. From there, he occupied the hot seat for hours as rivals tried to best his time.</p><p><strong>Brandon McNulty</strong> was the only rider who came particularly close, going faster than Roglic at the check point at 4.7 km into the course, but he lost time over the long descent off the initial climb. He came up just short of Roglic’s mark in the end, hitting the line less than two seconds slower than Roglic. Roglic’s Jumbo-Visma teammate <strong>Jonas Vingegaard</strong> was the day’s third fastest rider, finishing 18 seconds down on Roglic.</p><p>Roglic’s strong ride puts him in a solid position in the GC battle moving forward. <strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> rode to fifth on the day, 28 seconds behind Roglic, with <strong>Adam Yates</strong> finishing in sixth on the same time as Pogacar.</p><p><strong>Top 10, stage 1</strong></p><p>1 ROGLIC Primoz (Jumbo-Visma) 0:17:17<br>2 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:02<br>3 VINGEGAARD Jonas (Jumbo-Visma) 0:18<br>4 FOSS Tobias (Jumbo-Visma) 0:24<br>5 POGACAR Tadej (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:28<br>6 YATES Adam (Ineos Grenadiers)<br>7 BEVIN Patrick (Israel Start-Up Nation)<br>8 SCHELLING Ide (Bora-Hansgrohe) 0:29<br>9 ARANBURU Alex (Astana-Premier Tech) 0:30<br>10 SCACHMANN Maximilian (Bora-Hansgrohe) 0:36</p><p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p><p>1 ROGLIC Primoz (Jumbo-Visma) 0:17:17<br>2 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:02<br>3 VINGEGAARD Jonas (Jumbo-Visma) 0:18<br>4 FOSS Tobias (Jumbo-Visma) 0:24<br>5 POGACAR Tadej (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:28<br>6 YATES Adam (Ineos Grenadiers)<br>7 BEVIN Patrick (Israel Start-Up Nation)<br>8 SCHELLING Ide (Bora-Hansgrohe) 0:29<br>9 ARANBURU Alex (Astana-Premier Tech) 0:30<br>10 SCACHMANN Maximilian (Bora-Hansgrohe) 0:36</p><h3>Bouhanni speaks out following racial abuse after sprint incident</h3><p><strong>Nacer Bouhanni</strong> shared screenshots on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/bouhanni-speaks-out-following-racial-abuse-after-sprint-incident/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Monday</a> that showed numerous instances of racist abuse that has been directed at him after the incident at <strong>Cholet-Pays de la Loire</strong> in which he was relegated for driving <strong>Jake Stewart</strong> into the barriers in the sprint.</p><p>Bouhanni posted examples of abusive messages in multiple different languages on his Instagram story, and also wrote a statement of his own.</p><p>“Hello to all the little jokers who have been amusing themselves for a week by writing to me personally or commenting on certain cycling websites that I should return to Africa, that I am a criminal, that I am a North African who needs to be interned and who are constantly sending me [pig emojis],” Bouhanni wrote in a post shared to his Instagram story.</p><p>“Know that I was born in France and that I am going to file a complaint, because I have been putting up with this for a long time already and I’ve kept silent, but this time I won’t let it go anymore.”</p><h3>Consonni wins the Ronde de Mouscron</h3><p><strong>Chiara Consonni</strong> nabbed her first pro one-day win on Monday at the <strong>Ronde de Mouscron</strong>.</p><p>The UCI 1.1-rated event, a circuit race in Mouscron in Belgium’s Wallonia region came down to a bunch kick after 121 km.

The 34-year-old Canadian has a number of goals on the year, but he is prioritizing the <strong>Tokyo Olympics</strong> as his <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/mike-woods-is-all-in-for-the-olympics-in-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">biggest target</a> on the season.</p><p>“That’s kind of the big X on the calendar,” he said of the Olympics. “Everything else is going to be secondary to that. The Tour, the Classics, those are those secondary big goals. But it’s all in for the Olympics for me.</p><p>“I always like one-day races, it’s a lot of climbing miles, and it’s the Olympics. As a Canadian, as a guy coming from a track background, the Olympics are the kind of be-all, end-all, and I hold them in higher esteem than most cyclists, particularly because I’m a proud Canadian.”</p><h3>Schär responds to disqualification</h3><p>A day after being disqualified from the <strong>Tour of Flanders</strong> for throwing a bottle in a non-designated zone, <strong>Michael Schär</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/schar-responds-to-bottle-throw-dsq-we-are-the-most-approachable-sport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">addressed the topic</a> of giving bottles to fans in a post on social media.</p><p>Schär wrote an Instagram post on Monday sharing the story of how a bottle he received as a child at the Tour de France impacted his life and career as a pro.</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNRl0X8Adjr/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\"></blockquote><h2>In case you missed it …</h2><ul><li>Images from Rhode.Photo, Peloton Brief, and Cor Vos <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/annemiek-van-vleuten-solos-to-victory-at-the-tour-of-flanders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tell the story</a> of <strong>Annemiek van Vleuten’s</strong> second <strong>Tour of Flanders</strong> victory.</li></ul><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"33e3cd29049b31345dc0d09a251e73077c6b22c81c5adfd43870c8dd92f4c89e","category":"Cycling"}
