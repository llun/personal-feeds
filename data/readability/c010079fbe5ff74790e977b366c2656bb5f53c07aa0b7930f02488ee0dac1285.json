(I won’t infect the rest of your day with an example.) Some explanations in science seem to be the earworm equivalent: inherently intuitive, making them stick readily in the mind. That’s obviously the case for the hypothesis that a warming Arctic leads to a wigglier jet stream, producing weather extremes in the mid-latitudes like the recent epic cold snap in the central US.</p><p>The cold arrived after the spinning “polar vortex” in the upper atmosphere above the Arctic was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/02/16/setup-arctic-outbreak-niziol/\">disturbed in January</a>, unleashing its contents southward as the jet stream detoured from its usual commute. Could this behavior actually be a consequence of global warming? The suggestion has appeared in news articles and Twitter threads across the land. But the idea is stickier than the science says it should be.</p><h2>Jet setting</h2><p>Although the specifics vary, the general idea is based on the fact that the Arctic is warming faster than the midlatitudes. As a result, the temperature difference between them is getting a little smaller. The jet stream forms at the boundary between the Arctic and midlatitude air, so a smaller temperature difference would weaken the jet stream. And a weaker jet stream is more prone to great, wiggling meanders that can bring you cold air from the north or warm air from the south.</p><p>Weather data from the last few decades contains some trends in the midlatitudes, implying that the warming Arctic could be messing with weather patterns there. However, this is a case where the mantra “correlation is not causation” serves well. Climate scientists don’t just hunt for trends and blame them all on human-caused climate change. They study the mechanisms that could drive those trends to evaluate which hypothesis (sometimes among many) can actually explain them.</p><p>Some modeling has found plausible linkages between certain patterns our weather and things like Arctic warming, sea ice loss, and even snowcover decline. But more commonly—as <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-is-arctic-warming-linked-to-polar-vortext-other-extreme-weather\">detailed by Carbon Brief</a> after another US winter chill in 2019—models fail to demonstrate a linkage. It’s certainly possible that the models aren’t getting it right, but this should at least give us pause regarding any connections.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073071\">2017 study</a>, for one example, concluded that trends in the stratospheric polar vortex were likely to be the result of natural variability rather than human-caused sea ice loss. And an <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00954-y\" rel=\"nofollow\">article published</a> in the journal Nature Climate Change last November noted that observations and studies in the last few years haven’t strengthened the case. “The short-term tendencies from the late 1980s through to early 2010s that fueled the initial speculation of Arctic influence have not continued over the past decade,” the authors wrote. “Long-term trends in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_oscillation\">Arctic Oscillation</a> and [jet stream] waviness, updated to winter 2019/20, are small and indistinguishable from internal variability.”</p><p>IPCC reports, too, have evaluated the state of the science on this question. The 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/valmasdel/status/1362027199038173191\">checked in</a> quite recently. “There is only low to medium confidence in the current nature of Arctic/mid-latitude weather linkages because conclusions of recent analyses are inconsistent,” the report stated. “Overall, changes in the stratospheric polar vortex and [Arctic Oscillation] are not separable from natural variability, and so cannot be attributed to greenhouse gas forced sea ice loss.”</p><h2>Not conclusive</h2><p>That said, some climate scientists <em>do</em> find the evidence that climate change helped cause the event&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rahmstorf/status/1362058117593366535\">convincing</a>, even as others <a href=\"https://twitter.com/polar_james/status/1362003642191069184\">don’t</a>. And this isn’t a fake debate involving a few contrarian gadflies, like those who reject human-caused warming altogether. There truly isn’t a consensus either way because the research doesn’t dictate a clear answer yet. That means that confident statements linking jet stream weirdness to a human-caused <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CColose/status/1361393735117008899\">trend</a> make <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoffVallis/status/1361444674653855748\">many</a> climate scientists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimWoollings/status/1361374039290314757\">grumpy</a>.</p><p>So what can be said about the chill that just stretched down through the central US to Texas? While <a href=\"https://sanantonioreport.org/texas-winter-weather-climatologists/\">rare</a> and extreme, it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hausfath/status/1362167091831316482\">not unprecedented</a>. And as the Arctic gets warmer, the air that sometimes spills southward won’t be quite as frigid as it used to be. But science does not yet have a clear answer as to whether the mechanisms that control that spilling are changing with global warming. Instead, there are multiple competing answers being tested.</p><p>Apart from assigning blame, this is significant for defining what weather extremes we expect in the future. For now, climate science can’t tell you whether opening a winter coat business in Texas is a smart long-term investment—even if the wiggly jet stream hypothesis seems to make sense. Climate science <em>can</em>, however, confirm that winter still exists. It’s always wise to prepare for weather extremes that can trigger cascading failures of the systems that are meant to keep us safe.</p></div></div>","author":"Scott K.
