The apps that earn the most money in the ‌App Store‌ are still subject to the full 30 percent fee and make up most of the money that Apple collects.</p><p>Google today also announced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/google-to-lower-play-store-commission/\">similar price drop</a> for developers, and starting on July 1, Google will collect 15 percent in Play Store fees from developers earning under $1 million. Google too stands to lose little money. Sensor Tower estimates that if Google's lowered fees had been available across 2020, Google would have missed out on $587 million, or about five percent of the $11.6 billion in Google Play fees for the year.</p><blockquote><p>If the 15% fee schedule on revenue up to $1 million had been in place on Google Play in 2020, Google would have missed out on $587 million, or about 5% of Sensor Tower's estimate of $11.6 billion in Google Play fees for the year.</p><p>If Apple's program had been in place for 2020, Sensor Tower estimates that it would have missed out on $595 million, or about 2.7% of its estimated $21.7 billion in ‌App Store‌ fees in 2020.</p></blockquote><p>Neither Apple nor Google share specific data on ‌App Store‌ sales, so Sensor Tower's data is based on estimates and is a rough calculation rather than an exact number. Apple lumps revenue collected from the ‌App Store‌ alongside other services, and Apple collected $54.76 billion in fiscal 2020.</p><p>All developers who earn less than $1 million from the ‌App Store‌ in a calendar year are eligible for reduced fees, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/03/apple-developers-app-store-small-business/\">applies to</a> approximately 98 percent of developers. Developers who exceed $1 million in sales will face the standard 30 percent fees. The fee reduction applies to app purchases, in-app purchases, and subscriptions.</p><p>Sensor Tower in January estimated that 2020 ‌App Store‌ spending <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/app-store-spending-72-billion-2020/\">hit $72 billion</a>, with users spending the most on games and entertainment.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad/\">Apple Shares 'Jump' AirPods Pro Ad</a></h3><p>Sunday March 14, 2021 9:09 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple today shared a new AirPods Pro-focused ad called \"Jump\" on its YouTube channel, highlighting the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency features of the earbuds in a creative way.
