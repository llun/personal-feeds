We want to operationalize that as the standard for all 58 counties in the state. So effective March 1, not only are we doing that through our third-party administrator, but we are also setting aside 10 percent of all first doses, beginning with a baseline of 75,000 doses every single week that will be made available and set aside for those educators and childcare workers that are supporting our efforts to get our kids back into in-person instruction. That’s effective March 1. And the reason we can do that more formally, even though we have allowed for it over the course of the last number of weeks, is the window of visibility into the future with more vaccinations that we know are now coming from the Biden administration.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/19/world/19virus-briefing-cali-newsom/19virus-briefing-cali-newsom-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg\" alt=\"Video player loading\"></p></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Gov.

Gavin Newsom said on Friday that, starting March 1, the state will reserve 10 percent of its first doses of Covid-19 vaccines for teachers and school employees.</p><p>Noting that the federal government has been steadily increasing the state’s vaccine allotment, the governor said he would set aside 75,000 doses each week for teachers and staff members planning to return to public school campuses in person. Although California prioritizes teachers for the vaccine, supply has been an issue. Only about three dozen of the state’s 58 counties have had enough doses on hand to immunize those who work at public schools.</p><p>Most of California’s large school districts — including those in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco — have been operating remotely for the majority of students for almost a year. Mr. Newsom said reopening schools would be particularly important for single parents whose children have been learning from home.</p><p>As big school districts up and down the West Coast have mostly kept their buildings closed, Boston, New York, Miami, Houston and Chicago have been resuming in-person instruction.</p><p>New guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/health/school-reopenings-cdc.html?pageType=LegacyCollection&amp;collectionName=school-reopenings&amp;label=school-reopenings&amp;module=hub_Band&amp;region=inline&amp;template=storyline_band_recirc\" title=\"\">urge school districts to reopen</a> have not changed the minds of powerful teachers’ unions opposed to returning students to classrooms without more stringent precautions.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/world/vaccinating-oregons-teachers-might-not-be-enough-to-reopen-its-schools.html\" title=\"\">Oregon</a>, the governor prioritized teachers and school staff members for vaccination — ahead of some older people, which went against C.D.C. guidelines.</p><p>Mr. Newsom’s announcement was aimed at appeasing California’s teachers’ unions, which have demanded vaccination as a condition of returning to what they regard as a potentially hazardous workplace. The California Teachers Association this week began airing statewide television ads noting that the coronavirus is still a threat and demanding that the state not reopen classrooms without putting safety first.</p><p>The governor, who faces a recall effort over the state’s lockdowns, was also responding to fellow Democrats who control the Legislature and who on Thursday introduced a fast-track bill to reopen schools by April 15, using prioritized vaccines for teachers and hefty financial incentives.</p><p>The legislative plan calls for spending $12.6 billion in state and federal funding to help districts cover reopening costs, summer school, extended days and other measures to address learning loss. It largely aligns with the priorities of the unions, and state lawmakers said they expect it to pass swiftly.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Newsom said he was very pleased with the plan but felt it didn’t push districts to open fast enough, and threatened to veto the bill if it passes.</p><p>“April 15!” he exclaimed. “That’s almost the end of the school year.”</p><p>The governor also noted that the C.D.C. recently issued <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new guidelines</a> saying that teacher vaccination need not be a prerequisite to reopening schools, as long as other health measures were enforced.</p><p>In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, issued an emergency order on Friday requiring schools to offer in-person instruction to all students starting March 8.</p><p>“The data and science is clear — kids can and should learn in-person, and it is safe to do so,” said Mr. Sununu in a statement. “I would like to thank all school districts, teachers and administrators who have been able to successfully navigate this path.”</p></div><div data-test-id=\"live-blog-post\" data-source-id=\"100000007614020\"><div><h2 itemprop=\"headline\"><a

Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Two positive developments this week could potentially expand access to the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at a time when nations around the world are trying to ramp up vaccinations.</p><p>A study in Israel showed that the vaccine is robustly effective after the first shot, echoing what <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/02/world/covid-19-coronavirus#astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine\" title=\"\">other research has shown</a> for the AstraZeneca vaccine and raising the possibility that regulators in some countries could authorize delaying a second dose instead of giving both on the strict schedule of three weeks apart as tested in clinical trials.</p><p>Although regulators in the United States have held fast to the requirement that people receive two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine three weeks apart, the British government decided to prioritize giving as many people as possible an initial dose, allowing delays of up to 12 weeks before the second dose. The Israeli study could <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/health/coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html\" title=\"\">bolster arguments</a> for emulating that approach in other countries.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00448-7/fulltext\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Published in The Lancet</a> on Thursday and drawing from a group of 9,100 Israeli health care workers, the study showed that Pfizer’s vaccine was 85 percent effective 15 to 28 days after receiving the first dose. Pfizer and BioNTech’s late-stage clinical trials, which enrolled 44,000 people, showed that the vaccine was 95 percent effective if two doses were given three weeks apart.</p><p>Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and an adviser to President Biden, said at a White House news conference on the pandemic on Friday that the results of the study are not significant enough to change the U.S. recommendations.</p><p>He pointed out that the people in the study were on the younger and healthier side and the researchers could not say how long the protection from one shot of the vaccine would last. He also said it was possible that a less-than-optimal dose might not kill the most powerful variants of the virus, theoretically allowing them to spread more quickly in the population.</p><p>“We want the public not to be confused. The recommendation from the F.D.A. is two doses, just as it always has been,” Andy Slavitt, a White House virus adviser, said during the briefing.</p><p>Pfizer and BioNTech also announced on Friday that their vaccine can be stored at standard freezer temperatures for up to two weeks, potentially expanding the number of smaller pharmacies and doctors’ offices that could administer the vaccine, which now must be stored at ultracold temperatures.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-covid-19-vaccine-stability-data\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a statement</a>, the companies said they have submitted the new temperature data to the Food and Drug Administration, which would need to sign off on guidance to providers that would allow them to store the vaccines at the new temperatures.</p><p>Distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been complicated by the requirement that it be stored in freezers that keep the vaccines between -112 and -76 degrees Fahrenheit. The vaccines are shipped in a specially designed container that can be used as temporary storage for up to 30 days, if it is refilled with dry ice every five days. The vaccine can also be refrigerated for up to five days in a regular refrigerator, if it has not yet been diluted for use in patients.</p><p>A similar vaccine from Moderna, by contrast, <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-longer-shelf-life-its-covid-19-vaccine\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">can be stored in standard freezers</a> and then in a refrigerator for up to 30 days, which has allowed it to be used more readily at smaller vaccination sites.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> said on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\" title=\"\">about 41 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine</a>, including about 16.2

href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/us/coronavirus-vaccines.html\" title=\"\">pry loose millions of doses of coronavirus vaccine</a> that have been sitting in freezers because they were allocated in excess to nursing homes or stockpiled for second doses.</p><p>Federal officials estimate that as many as six million doses are unnecessarily stowed away. Freeing them up could increase the number of doses administered by more than 10 percent — significantly stepping up the pace of the nation’s inoculation program at a time when speed is of the essence to save lives, curb disease and head off more contagious variants of the virus.</p><p>So far, 56 million shots have been administered in the United States, and only 12 percent of the population have received one or more doses. And the idea that doses are sitting in cold storage while millions of people languish on waiting lists has deeply frustrated government officials.</p><p>Part of the problem stems from when the federal vaccination program for long-term-care facilities began late last year. At the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based allotments on the number of beds, even though occupancy rates are the lowest in years. Then the C.D.C. doubled that allotment to cover staff. But while four-fifths of long-term-care residents agreed to be vaccinated in the first month of the program, 63 percent of staff members refused, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7005e2.htm?s_cid=mm7005e2_w\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the agency reported</a>.

That stop-start-stop has created a groundswell of anger toward Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat in the third year of his first term, that is increasingly fueling a movement to recall him from office in one of the bluest of blue states.</p><p>Since March, 1.5 million Californians have signed a petition to oust Mr. Newsom, enough to trigger an election for a new governor. If enough of the signatures are verified, it will be the fourth <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/us/gavin-newsom-recall.html\" title=\"\">recall election</a> of a governor in American history.</p><p>The recall campaign has been funded by the Republican National Committee, which committed $250,000, as well as Silicon Valley tech investors such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/business/corner-office-chamath-palihapitiya-social-capital.html\" title=\"\">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, who donated $100,000. Small-business owners have also been an engine behind the effort, said Randy Economy, the spokesman for the Recall Gavin Newsom campaign.</p><p>“He’s broken the back of small-business owners and put many of them out of business for the rest of their lives,” Mr. Economy said.</p><p>Nearly 40,000 small businesses had closed in the state by September — more than in any other state since the pandemic began, according to a <a href=\"https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/business-closures-update-sep-2020\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report compiled by Yelp</a>. Half had shut permanently, far more than the 6,400 that had closed permanently in New York.</p><p>Few of the pandemic choices that Mr. Newsom has faced have been easy. California has suffered enormously from Covid-19, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?name=styln-coronavirus-live&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;impression_id=&amp;variant=1_Show#states\" title=\"\">more than 3.5 million cases</a> and 47,000 deaths.</p><p>Dan Newman, a political strategist for Mr. Newsom, said the governor was focused on<span> </span>vaccinations and reopening the state. Mr. Newman blamed “state and national G.O.P. partisans” for supporting “this Republican recall scheme in hopes of creating an expensive, distracting and destructive circus.”</p><p>In places such as Los Angeles County, where Mr. Newsom won <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/california-governor\" title=\"\">72 percent of the vote</a> in 2018, and neighboring Orange County, a more conservative area, the small-business anger is particularly intense. One local business owner leading the movement to open California’s economy is Andrew Gruel, 40, a chef who owns Slapfish, a seafood restaurant chain.</p><p>Mr. Gruel argued in an interview last month that California’s lockdown rules were confusing and hurt small businesses disproportionately. “None of the rules make sense,” he said one afternoon from the Slapfish in Huntington Beach.</p><p>As evidence, Mr. Gruel pointed to the Walmart just up the road. While local restaurants could not have diners sit outside in the first lockdown, even six feet apart and with plexiglass between them, a Burger King inside the Walmart remained open, he said.</p><p>“And that was legal,” he said. “It’s like W.W.E. in there, people cross-body blocking each other for B.K. delight.”</p><p>Thomas Fuller contributed reporting.</p></div><div data-test-id=\"live-blog-post\" data-source-id=\"100000007614501\"><div><h2 itemprop=\"headline\"><a href=\"#under-fire-in-a-scandal-over-nursing-home-deaths-cuomo-again-lashes-out-and-draws-a-new-critic\">Under fire in a scandal over nursing home deaths, Cuomo again lashes out and draws a new critic.</a></h2></div><figure aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"><div><p><span>Video</span></p><div><div aria-labelledby=\"modal-title\" role=\"region\"><header><p>transcript</p></header><div><div><p>transcript</p><h2>Cuomo Addresses Nursing Home Investigation</h2><h4>At a news conference on Friday, Gov.

Andrew M. Cuomo on Friday launched into a 90-minute defense of his actions while lashing out at critics he said were operating in a “toxic political environment.”</p><p>Mr. Cuomo said he understood the outrage over his monthslong undercounting of deaths in those facilities, but insisted no state policy contributed to that toll. At the same time, however, the governor unveiled a series of reforms to address the management and safety of nursing homes, saying, “that is the only way families will have peace of mind.”</p><p>Mr. Cuomo’s remarks, during an hour-and-a-half news conference in the State Capitol, came as he faced one of the biggest political crises of his decade-long tenure, including a federal investigation of his administration and a move by the governor’s fellow Democrats to strip him of the unilateral emergency powers he has exercised during the pandemic.</p><p>On Friday, another prominent Democrat, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of Queens, joined a chorus of lawmakers backing investigations into the state’s handling of nursing homes during the pandemic, noting that “thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers lost their lives.”</p><p>“Their loved ones and the public deserve answers and transparency from their elected leadership,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement, issued during Mr. Cuomo’s news conference.</p><p>The count of deaths is at the heart of the issues confronting the Cuomo administration. For months, the state now concedes, the official death tally of residents in nursing homes and long-term care facilities was greatly underreported. The state counted the total losses, but they were attributed to the hospitals where the patients died, not the facilities where they had lived, effectively hiding the toll the pandemic took on those facilities.</p><p>But in the wake of a scathing report three weeks ago from the state attorney general, Letitia James, suggesting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/nyregion/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo.html\" title=\"\">a major undercount</a> of deaths of nursing home and long-term care residents, the state has now updated those numbers, to more than 15,000 from about 8,500 in late January.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Cuomo again said he accepted blame for that undercount — “I take responsibility for all of it, period,” he said. In particular, the governor has said repeatedly, his lack of candor in releasing accurate data had created a space for false information to be propagated.</p><p>“We created a void by not producing enough public information fast enough,” Mr. Cuomo said, adding, “and conspiracy theories, and politics and rumors fill the void.”</p><p>But he simultaneously sought to reframe the debate, saying the criticism of him constituted politically motivated attacks by Republicans and others operating in a “toxic political environment.”</p><p>Mr. Cuomo had repeated a similar message for much of the week, but the crisis did not show signs of abating.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Mr. Cuomo verbally attacked a Queens assemblyman, Ron T. Kim, after he told reporters for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/nyregion/nursing-homes-cuomo-ron-kim.html\" title=\"\">The New York Times </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/cuomo-ron-kim-nursing-home/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a> that Mr. Cuomo had berated him during a call, threatening to publicly tarnish the assemblyman and urging him to issue a statement to change remarks he had made about the nursing home issue.</p></div><div data-test-id=\"live-blog-post\"

href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm?s_cid=mm7008e3_w\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">are reassuringly safe</a>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday.</p><p>As of Thursday, some 41 million Americans <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\" title=\"\">have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine</a>; about 16.2 million people have been fully vaccinated. But some people remain wary, concerned that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/health/covid-vaccine-variants.html\" title=\"\">vaccines</a> may have been rushed to market or that side effects may have gone unnoticed.</p><p>The new data provide ample evidence that the vaccines are safe, although adverse reactions have occurred in a few patients.</p><p>The C.D.C. gathered reports from a long established national surveillance network and a new safety monitoring system, called V-Safe, created specifically to track the coronavirus vaccines. Participants volunteer to enroll and fill out daily surveys reporting symptoms.</p><p>The surveillance is neither uniform nor complete, but the tracking effort nonetheless is “the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history,” the agency said.</p><p>From Dec. 14, to Jan. 13, nearly 14 million doses of the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were administered, mostly to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities.</p><p>There were nearly 7,000 reports of adverse events, the C.D.C. reported, but 91 percent were not serious. The adverse events were consistent with those seen in clinical trials of the vaccines. The most common side effects were headaches, fatigue, muscle aches, chills and dizziness. They tended to occur on the day after people got vaccinated.</p><p>The C.D.C. reported data on second-dose reactions only for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, finding that they were more frequent than seen after the first dose.</p><p>Deaths following vaccination have been rare — just 113 were reported — and they appeared to be coincidental, unrelated to the vaccines. Seventy-eight deaths occurred among residents of long-term care facilities. Half of those residents were already in hospice or had a do-not-resuscitate order at the time of vaccination.</p><p>There have been scattered reports that the vaccines <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/health/Covid-moderna-vaccine-allergies.html\" title=\"\">may elicit anaphylaxis</a>, an extreme and potentially deadly allergic reaction to the vaccines.

He tempered his comments with caution.</p><p>“I believe we’ll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year, and God willing this Christmas will be different than last,” he said, “but I can’t make that commitment to you.”</p><p>Governors in both parties have been pressing the Biden administration for clearer and consistent messaging about the timeline for the vaccination campaign. Last week, Mr. Biden <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-vaccines.html\" title=\"\">struck a careful note,</a> saying he did not expect that every American would be vaccinated by the end of the summer.</p><p>This week, he said there would be enough vaccine available by the end of July to do so.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s visit came after he attended a virtual meeting with fellow leaders of the Group of 7 nations earlier in the day. There, he promised that the United States would renew its bonds with Europe and pledged to donate $4 billion to an international vaccine effort. In Kalamazoo, he spoke of the importance of fighting the pandemic beyond the United States’ borders.</p><p>“It’s not enough that we find cures for Americans,” the president said, adding, “You can’t build a wall or a fence high enough to keep a pandemic out.”</p><p>The winter storm this week has delayed the shipment of six million vaccine doses, adding a layer of frustration to an already fraught situation. Earlier this week, the National Governors Association <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/NGAExecutiveCommitteeLettertoPresident.pdf\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to Mr. Biden, praising the administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, Jeffrey D. Zients, for “doing great work,” but also asking for better coordination between the federal government and the states. Mr. Zients accompanied Mr. Biden to Michigan.</p><p>Mr. Biden has repeatedly promised to get 100 million shots into Americans’ arms by his 100th day in office. His pledge appeared ambitious when he first made it before Election Day, but has more recently been criticized as not ambitious enough.</p><p>The country is now vaccinating an average of 1.7 million people a day, and Mr. Biden said the country was “on track to surpass” the 100 million goal.</p><p>Mr. Biden was introduced by Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chief executive, who said his employees had been “working around the clock” to ramp up vaccine manufacturing and accelerate delivery. Pfizer, in partnership with BioNTech, is one of two companies that have emergency authorization to sell coronavirus vaccines in the United States. The other is Moderna.</p><p>Mr. Bourla said that over the next few weeks, Pfizer expected to increase the number of doses for the United States from five million to more than 10 million per week, and that it would provide the government a total of 200 million doses by the end of May, two months ahead of schedule.</p><p>Mr. Biden appealed to Americans to be patient as they waited for the vaccine. “I can’t give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we are doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later,” he said. He also pleaded with Americans to take the vaccine if it is offered to them, and repeatedly vouched that it would help rather than harm them.</p><p>“I know people want confidence that it’s safe,” he said. “Well, I just toured where it’s being made. It takes more time to do the check for safety than it does actually to make the vaccine.

Schumer wrote. “However, we must not allow Republican obstructionism to deter us from our mission of delivering help to Americans who desperately need this relief.”</p><p>Republican leaders, who have been searching for a way to derail the proposal even though polls show a large majority of Americans support it, on Friday labeled it a “payoff to progressives.” They said the bill spent too much and included a liberal wish list of programs like aid to state and local governments, which they called a “blue state bailout” even though many states facing shortfalls are controlled by Republicans.</p><p>They also objected to the bill’s increased unemployment benefits, which they argued would discourage people from looking for work.</p><p>The attacks followed weeks of varying Republican objections to the package, including warnings that it would add to the federal budget deficit, unleash inflation and, they said, do little to help the economy recover and grow.</p><p>Republicans also said Democrats were violating Mr. Biden’s calls for “unity” by proceeding without bipartisan consensus.</p><p>“Critics say my plan is too big, that it costs $1.9

Other leaders also announced pledges, and at the end of the meeting, the European Union’s chief executive said that new commitments from the E.U., Japan, Germany and Canada had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/G7/status/1362787855765032961\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more than doubled the G7’s total support to $7.5 billion</a>.</p><p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/19-02-2021-g7-leaders-commit-us-4.3-billion-to-finance-global-equitable-access-to-tests-treatments-and-vaccines-in-2021\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released a statement welcoming the additional pledges</a> for the campaign, known as Covax, and noting that commitments for the program now total $10.3 billion — but also saying that a funding gap of $22.9 billion remained for the campaign’s work this year.</p><p>The Covax effort has been led by the public-private health partnership known as <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance</a>, as well as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization. It aims to distribute vaccines that have been deemed safe and effective by the W.H.O., with a special emphasis on providing them to low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>Public health experts often say that unless everyone is vaccinated, it’s as if no one is vaccinated.</p><p>So far, the United States has pledged more money than any other nation, with at least one official noting that diminishing the pandemic’s global impact would benefit the country’s own economy and security. White House officials said the money would be delivered in multiple tranches: an initial donation of $500 million right away, followed shortly by an additional $1.5 billion. The remaining $2 billion will delivered by the end of 2022. The funds were approved last year by a Republican-led Senate when President Donald J. Trump was still in office.</p><p>Mr. Biden’s engagement in the global fight against the pandemic stands in stark contrast to the approach of Mr. Trump, who withdrew from the World Health Organization and disdained foreign assistance, pursuing a foreign policy he called “America First.” Mr. Biden rejoined the World Health Organization immediately after taking office in January.</p><p>National security experts have said the United States should consider donating vaccine doses to poorer countries, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/world/asia/vaccine-diplomacy-india-china.html\" title=\"\">India and China are already doing in an effort to expand their global influence</a>. But an official said that the U.S. would not be able to share vaccines while the American vaccination campaign is still continuing to expand.</p><p>The global vaccination effort also stands to benefit from a commitment by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/health/vaccine-novavax.html\" title=\"\">the pharmaceutical company Novavax</a>, whose coronavirus vaccine is still in trials.</p><p>Under a memorandum of understanding between Gavi and Novavax, the company agreed to provide “1.1 billion cumulative doses,” though it did not specify a time frame. The vaccine will be manufactured and distributed globally by Novavax and the Serum Institute of India, the <a href=\"https://www.seruminstitute.com/about_us.php\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">world’s largest vaccine manufacturer</a>.</p><p>Novavax is expected to provide vaccines primarily to high-income countries, the company said in its announcement, while the Serum Institute will supply “low-, middle, and upper-middle-income countries,” using “a tiered pricing schedule.”</p><p>Novovax <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/health/covid-vaccine-novavax-south-africa.html\" title=\"\">recently reported</a> that its vaccine showed robust protection in a large British trial, but was less effective against the variant of the virus first identified in South Africa.

All 50 states have been impacted. The six million doses represents about three days of delayed shipping. There are three places along the distribution chain that have been impacted by the weather. First, FedEx, UPS and McKesson, our logistics and distribution teams, have all faced challenges as workers have been snowed in and unable to get to work to package and ship the vaccines, kits and the required diluent. Second, road closures have held up delivery of vaccines at different points in the distribution process — between manufacturing sites to distribution and to shipping hubs. Third, more than 2,000 vaccine sites are located in areas with power outages, so they’re currently unable to receive doses. Because of 72-hour cold-chain constraints, we don’t want to ship doses to those locations and have them sitting at a site where they might expire. So the vaccines are sitting safe and sound in our factories and hubs, ready to be shipped out as soon as the weather allows. Now, as weather conditions improve, we’re already working to clear this backlog: 1.4 million doses are already in transit today, and we anticipate that all the backlog doses will be delivered within the next week. We’re asking vaccine administration sites to extend their hours even further, and offer additional appointments and to try to reschedule the vaccinations over the coming days and weeks as significantly more supply arrives.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div><p><img src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/18/world/18virus-briefing-storm-vaccines/18virus-briefing-storm-vaccines-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg\" alt=\"Video player loading\"></p></div></div></div><figcaption><span>Andy Slavitt, a White House pandemic adviser, said a backlog of coronavirus vaccine shipments caused by severe winter storms across the country were expected to be delivered in the next week.</span><span><span>Credit</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span>James Estrin/The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>The White House on Friday said that six million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been held up because of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/19/us/winter-storm-weather-live\" title=\"\">snowstorms across the country</a>, creating a backlog affecting every state and throwing off the pace of vaccination appointments over the next week.</p><p>Andy Slavitt, a White House pandemic adviser, said at a news conference that the six million doses represented about three days’ worth of shipping delays, and that states had already made up for some of the backlog with existing stock. Of the six million doses, 1.4 million were already in transit on Friday, he said, and the rest were expected to be delivered in the next week.</p><p>But Mr. Slavitt pleaded with local officials to make up for the lost time in the coming days.</p><p>“We’re asking vaccine administration sites to extend their hours even further and offer additional appointments and to try to reschedule the vaccinations over the coming days and weeks as significantly more supply arrives,” he said.</p><p>The delay revealed how interconnected the nation’s vaccine distribution network is, vulnerable to substantial interruptions because of extreme weather. Mr. Slavitt said that FedEx, UPS and McKesson — the drug distribution giant that manages Moderna’s vaccine — had been impeded, with workers snowed in and unable to package and ship vaccines, including the kits and diluent that go with them.</p><p>FedEx and UPS would make Saturday deliveries this week, he said.</p><p>Closed roads on delivery routes were also forming a bottleneck, and more than 2,000 vaccination sites located in areas with power outages could not receive doses. That prompted federal officials to hold off shipping to areas that might not be able to keep them at the frigid temperatures required.</p><p>“They’re sitting safe and sound in our factories and hubs, ready to be shipped out as soon as the weather allows,” Mr. Slavitt said.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/16/world/covid-19-coronavirus-white-house-vaccine-supply.html\" title=\"\">projected “widespread delays”</a> in vaccine shipments and deliveries because of weather affecting a FedEx facility in Memphis and a UPS facility in Louisville, both vaccine shipping hubs.</p><p>Shipment delays had already been reported in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Washington, among other states, forcing vaccine sites to temporarily shutter and coveted appointments to be rescheduled.</p><p>In Texas, where millions of residents lost power during this week’s powerful storm, a delivery of more than 400,000 first doses and 330,000 second doses <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2021/02/18/hundreds-of-thousands-of-covid-19-vaccine-deliveries-injections-delayed-by-winter-storm/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">had been delayed</a> in anticipation of the bad weather. A portion of those shots — roughly 35,000 doses of Pfizer’s vaccine — were sent to providers in North Texas on Wednesday, but <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Houston-s-weather-closed-COVID-vaccine-sites-15955329.php\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shipments will continue to depend on safety conditions</a>.</p><p>Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Thursday that the state was “asking providers that aren’t able to store vaccine due to power outages to transfer it elsewhere or administer it so it doesn’t spoil.”</p><p>On Monday, health officials in Texas <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/power-outage-forces-texas-officials-scramble-administer-covid-19-vaccine-n1257999\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scrambled to get more than 5,000 shots into arms</a> after a power outage in a storage facility where they were being kept. But Mr. Van Deusen said that “reports of vaccine spoiling have been minimal.”</p><p>The Houston Health Department said Thursday that it would restart vaccinations for second doses this weekend, and schedule additional first and second dose appointments next week.</p><p>In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Friday that nearly all of the vaccines that were supposed to be delivered by the federal government had been delayed by the snow. He said the Pfizer vaccines would now arrive on Monday, and Moderna’s would likely arrive in the middle of next week.</p><p>No appointments at state-run vaccination sites have been rescheduled so far, he said, though he suggested it was possible if the vaccines did not arrive soon.</p><p>“If there is any impact, we’ll let you know right away,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference he held earlier Friday.</p><p>The governor had said on Thursday night that most of the vaccines for New York, scheduled for delivery between Feb. 12 and Feb. 21, had been delayed.</p><p>In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday during an interview on WNYC that expected shipments of more than 100,000 doses had still not fully arrived from factories, but did not provide an update on when they would come.

The opening of two new distribution sites on Thursday had also been postponed, according to the city, with the launch of one at the Empire Outlets on Staten Island moved back to Friday and another in Queens still delayed.</p><p>“We still haven’t gotten everything we expect,” Mr. de Blasio said on Friday. “Everything’s been disrupted by the storm.”</p><p>In Los Angeles, the city said that <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-18/california-increases-covid-vaccines-first-doses-still-limited\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">appointments for about 12,500 people</a> would be delayed.</p><p>Gov.

They’re 50 percent on Long Island. New York City was closed. New York City is now 25 percent — in one week will go to 35 percent in New York City restaurants, which is consistent with New Jersey. What’s happening now is people in New York City, Staten Island, Manhattan, are going to New Jersey to those restaurants. So it’s not really accomplishing a purpose. So New York City restaurants will go to 35 percent next Friday. That will be consistent with New Jersey. Connecticut is still 50, Long Island is still 50. We understand that. But we’re responding to the data. Obviously, we’re more sensitive to New York City because of the density and the concentration, the history. But we’re headed in the right direction.

Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do. It’s also the smart thing to do.

H.O., on Friday urged countries and drugmakers to help speed up the manufacture and distribution of vaccines across the globe, warning that the world could be “back at square one” if some countries went ahead with their vaccination campaigns and left others behind.</p><p>“Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it’s also the smartest to do,” Dr. Tedros said at the Munich Security Conference, arguing that the longer it would take to vaccinate populations in every country, the longer the pandemic would remain out of control.</p><p>Wealthy countries have come under increased criticism in recent weeks for stockpiling doses, and keeping them away from low- and middle-income countries. Dr. Tedros used his comments to condemn the approach to public health in many countries, which he called “a failure even in the most advanced economies in our world.”</p><p>“It affects everything, and the whole world is now taken hostage by a small virus,” he said.</p><p>Speaking before Mr. Ghebreyesus, Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist, said that the tragedy now unfolding across the world because of the pandemic could have been largely avoided.</p><p>“It is a tragedy that the modest steps that would have been required to contain this epidemic were not taken in advance,” he said.</p><p>While Dr. Tedros welcomed new commitments from wealthy countries to fund international vaccine efforts, he said more needed to be done, and faster.</p><p>United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, who also spoke before Mr. Ghebreyesus, said more than 100 countries had not received a single dose, and humanitarian groups have urged the public-private health partnership leading the international vaccine effort, known as <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance</a>, to start delivering on its promises.</p><p>“While the Covax mechanism is designed specifically for equitable distribution and vaccine development, it has yet to deliver a single vaccine to a country,” says Claire Waterhouse, a South Africa-based advocacy coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.</p><p>More than 190 million people have been vaccinated worldwide, but almost none in Africa.

The decision means that, as of Monday, just over one-tenth of the almost 7 million residents of the Madrid region will remain in areas where they are not allowed to leave, except under special circumstances. Antonio Zapatero, a Madrid health official, said on Friday that the daily number of registered cases in Madrid was now down 35 percent from a week earlier and over 50 percent from two weeks earlier. Madrid is also easing its nighttime curfew, with bars and restaurants allowed to stay open until 11 p.m. rather than 9 p.m.</p></li><li><p>In recent months, <strong>Russia</strong> has scored a sweeping diplomatic win from an unexpected source: the success of its coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V. So far, more than 50 countries from Latin America to Asia have ordered 1.2 billion doses of the Russian vaccine, buffing the image of Russian science and lifting Moscow’s influence around the world. Yet in Russia things are not always what they seem, and this apparent triumph of soft-power diplomacy may not be all that the Kremlin would like the world to think. While Sputnik V is unquestionably effective, production is lagging, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/world/europe/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-soft-power.html\" title=\"\">raising questions about whether Moscow may be promising far more vaccine exports</a> than it can supply, and doing so at the expense of its own citizens.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>Vatican</strong> has clarified that employees who refuse a coronavirus vaccine will not be punished, after pushback over an internal decree suggesting that those who did not get vaccinated could be dismissed. Vatican City State <a href=\"https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2021-02/vatican-healthcare-coronavirus-vaccine-employees.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a> on Thursday that “alternative solutions” would be found for employees who did not want to be vaccinated.

His posts were widely shared, especially a photo of what he said were the legs of a cockroach in his stir-fried meal. A day after his post appeared, the hotel issued a statement calling on a “certain group of people” to stop posting “false information” with the intent of damaging the hotel’s reputation.

Except they were 34 and 44, not over 65, so despite their get-ups, which included spectacles, they were ineligible to get the shots in Florida.</p><p>However, the ruse may have worked before.

when business will return to previous levels.</p><p>Now and for the next several months at least, airlines are flying whomever they can wherever they can. That often means catering to a small group of people who are undeterred by the pandemic to travel to ski slopes or beaches.</p><p>“As a quick strategy, fly where people are,” said Ben Baldanza, a former chief executive of Spirit Airlines, the low-cost carrier. “That’s been a real smart strategy, but that’s not a long-term way for those airlines to make money.”</p><p>Such leisure travel offers limited comfort to an industry so thoroughly clobbered. Tourists and people visiting family and friends typically take up most of the seats on planes, but airlines rely disproportionately on revenue from corporate travelers in the front of the cabin.</p><p>Before the pandemic, business travel accounted for about 30 percent of trips but 40 to 50 percent of passenger revenue, according to Airlines for America, an industry association. And those customers aren’t expected to return in great numbers anytime soon.</p><p>The four largest U.S. airlines — American, Delta, United and Southwest — lost more than $31 billion last year, and the industry over all is shedding more than $150 million each day, according to an estimate from Airlines for America.</p><p>The industry spent much of the past year scrimping and saving, trimming older, less efficient planes from their fleets; renegotiating contracts; and encouraging tens of thousands of workers to take buyouts or early retirement packages.</p><p>But it hasn’t been enough to offset a drop of nearly two-thirds in air travel as public health experts and the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to discourage travel</a>. Airlines for America does not expect passenger numbers to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023. And airlines might have to wait even longer if the economic recovery falters because of the spread of coronavirus variants or a delay in vaccinations.</p><p>Some experts say that corporate travel may never return to peak levels, with many in-person meetings replaced by video conferences and phone calls.</p><p>Airlines are more hopeful, perhaps because they rely heavily on corporate travel.</p><p>Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, said on a conference call last month that about 40 percent of Delta’s big corporate customers expected their business travel to be fully recovered by 2022, and an additional 11 percent by 2023. Citing the airline’s internal research, he said 7 percent expected that business travel might never be fully restored, while the rest said they were unsure when things would return to previous levels.</p><p>American is “very optimistic” that corporate travel will return as vaccines are distributed, Vasu Raja, the airline’s chief revenue officer, told investors and reporters last month. But, he added, “the rate of that is unclear at best.”</p></div></article></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e9f1fd441e8197d92fefa0237f0e40a9541597cf975351136f68c10266bf6e0f","category":"Tech"}
