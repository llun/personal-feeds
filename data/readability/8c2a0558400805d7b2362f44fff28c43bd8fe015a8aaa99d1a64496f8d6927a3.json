For almost a year prior the headlines had been dominated by news of things happening along America’s southern border. Child Separations. Immigration Caravans. National Guard deployments. On social media channels the rhetoric from all sides, which had already been getting increasingly strident, ramped up to a fever pitch. Normal conversations spiraled completely out of control. I found myself caught up in it all, furious at family members, friends, and strangers alike.<span id=\"more-206112\"></span></p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-57.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>So I decided to unplug, punch out, take a ride and spend some time talking with people. Was it possible to meet with strangers and have conversations about the economy, homelessness, immigration, racism, the environment, and history? Would there be threads in what they said which pointed to common ground, or would everyone be so wildly divergent that there would be no hope of ever meeting in the middle? Was the real world becoming more like the virtual one, or was it the other way around?</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-53.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Over the course of the next 19 days, riding a <a href=\"https://rawlandcycles.com/products/ravn-frameset-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rawland Ravn</a> and taking photographs with a 50’s era <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Graphic\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Speed Graphic camera</a> and a camera lens I made myself, I traversed paved, sand, gravel, and dirt roads while interviewing over 15 people.

The Koda family lost everything due to a relocation to a Japanese American internment camp located in Colorado during WWII. After the war Keisaburo and his sons, Edward and William, restarted their farm and eventually bought back the original property.  </p><p>After the war, Keisaburo became highly active in Japanese American civil rights. A supporter and active member of JACL (Japanese American Citizens League), he launched the People’s Rights Protection Association to lobby against the notorious Alien Land Law (declared unconstitutional in 1948). In 1947, he organized the Naturalization Rights League and served as president. In the same era, he helped start a Japanese American-owned and operated insurance company to provide full coverage to Americans of Japanese descent. Recognizing a need for fair treatment in banking, Keisaburo was instrumental in opening Bank of Tokyo’s first California branch, becoming a director in 1952.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><strong>Vacation Cabin Rental Ad, Panoche Creek River Ranch, Fresno, CA</strong><br>11/3/2018</p><p>Kodak Ektascan B/RA X-Ray film (50 asa rated, 3.25×4.25)</p><p>A vacation cabin mounted on stilts acts as an advertisement for vacation rentals at Panoche Creek River Ranch outside of Fresno, CA.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><strong>Private reservoir, Almond farm, Delano, CA</strong><br>11/4/2018</p><p>Kodak Ektascan B/RA X-Ray film (50 asa rated, 3.25×4.25)</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><strong>Roadside memorial after Dia De Los Muertos, Delano, CA</strong><br>11/5/2018</p><p>Kodak Ektascan B/RA X-Ray film (50 asa rated, 3.25×4.25)</p><p>Days after Dia De Los Muertos the roadside memorials in the central valley are all graced with gifts for those they represent.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><strong>Sharon Garrison, Weedpatch, CA</strong><br>11/7/2018</p><p>Kodak Ektascan B/RA X-Ray film (50 asa rated, 3.25×4.25)</p><p>Sharon Garrison was born in the Sunset Camp and lived there until she was 7 when it was shut down.

Nor has he ever bought a pinhole camera. All of his cameras are handmade, special, for each project. Laden with symbolism and fanatic attention to details each is a work of art into itself.</p><p>His latest project, “Us vs. Them”, focuses on the artificial constructs that governments create to divide people from each other for the sake of power. “Are we really so different from the Syrian refugees fleeing to Greece? Or the water protectors protesting the building of an oil pipeline through their land, in the water they need to drink from and grow food with? I will spend weeks with a community before I take one photograph. I want to know them and for them to know me. I have a huge problem with photographers who come in for a day, take thousands of rapid-fire images, and then leave. One Syrian refugee told me that in Syria he distrusted and feared two things: Guns and cameras. Both would take away and never give back.”</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/bomr-145.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><strong>Federal Honor Camp (WWII prison camp) Ruins, Gordon Hirabayashi Campground, Tucson, AZ</strong><br>11/20/2018</p><p>Kodak Ektascan B/RA X-Ray film (50 asa rated, 3.25×4.25)</p><p> Gordon Hirabayashi was a senior at the University of Washington in 1942. He challenged the constitutionality of internment based on race or ancestry. He turned himself in to the FBI rather than report for relocation. His case went to the Supreme Court in 1943 where he was convicted and sentenced to serve at the Federal Honor Camp in the Santa Catalina Mountains.</p><p>In 1987 Peter Irons, a political science professor from the University of California, San Diego, had uncovered documents that clearly showed evidence of government misconduct in 1942—evidence that the government knew there was no military reason for the exclusion order but withheld that information from the United States Supreme Court. With this new information, Hirabayashi’s case was reheard by the federal courts, and in 1987 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned his criminal conviction. In 1988, the Civil Liberties Act was signed by President Ronald Reagan, which acknowledged the injustice and apologized for the internment.</p></div></div>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"8c2a0558400805d7b2362f44fff28c43bd8fe015a8aaa99d1a64496f8d6927a3","category":"Cycling"}
