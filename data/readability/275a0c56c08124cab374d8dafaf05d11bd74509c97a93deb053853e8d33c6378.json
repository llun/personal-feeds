This initial collection includes a few key pieces for eating and drinking, but Rapha says this is just the beginning – we can expect to see further collaborations between these two brands.</p><p>The first limited edition collection includes a titanium spork, a ti mug and a stainless steel insulated bottle. Each piece displays the words ‘Seems Appropriate’ which Rapha says conveys the contrasts of being comfortable at home versus out in the wilderness amidst an adventure. These premium pieces were built to be lightweight, but strong enough for the long haul.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha x Snow Peak bikepacking collection, Kanpai bottle\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle-696x696.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163746/Rapha-Snow-Peak-Kanpai-bottle-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></strong>The <strong>Kanpai Bottle</strong> is a vacuum-sealed, double walled stainless steel bottle that will keep cold drinks cold or hot drinks hot.

It measures 6.5” long and 1.6” wide, and they sell for $15.</p><h3>New Explore Men’s Clothing</h3><p>Coinciding with the Snow Peak collaboration, Rapha has added a few new clothing items to their men’s Explore collection. This collection is designed and trail-tested for off-road riding and bikepacking trips, and a new gilet, jacket and jersey have just joined the lineup.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Explore men's Lightweight Gilet\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163641/Rapha-Explore-lightweight-gilet-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>Made from 25gsm fabric, the new <strong>Explore Lightweight Gilet </strong>is one of Rapha’s lightest outer layers. The gilet will block wind, but also breathes well to keep your body temperature regulated through changing conditions. A DWR treatment provides water resistance for damp rides.</p><p>This gilet was kept simple to keep weight and bulk down, so it has a small front zipper placket and Rapha has forgone the usual cord pullers at the hem. The gilet packs into its own side pocket, and once packed up, the pocket has external pull loops for easy attachment to your bike or backpack. Rapha has also included a hanger loop on the back of the gilet for quick drying, and reflective logos on the front and back.</p><p>The Explore Lightweight Gilet comes in Mustard or Navy colors, and sizes range from XS-XXL. It follow’s Rapha’s ‘regular’ fit, so it offers a slightly relaxed cut. MSRP is $115.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Explore men's jacket\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket-696x696.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163545/Rapha-Explore-jacket-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>The <strong>Explore Jacket </strong>is a great option for those who prefer sleeves on their outer layers. Aside from the sleeves the jacket is quite similar to the gilet: It’s made from a 25gsm 100% Nylon fabric that’s light and packable, it has a water-repellent DWR finish, and it simultaneously blocks wind and breathes to vent body heat.</p><p>Like the vest the jacket packs up into its own side pocket with attachment loops, and Rapha has kept things simple with small zipper plackets and hems with no cord pullers. The jacket also gets a hanger loop on the back and reflective logos.</p><p>The Explore Jacket is offered in Terracotta or Navy colors, and provides a ‘regular’ fit. Sizes go from XS-XXL, and it sells for $135.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Explore men's merino tee\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee-696x696.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163653/Rapha-Explore-merino-tee-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>Rapha’s <strong>Explore Merino Tee</strong> takes advantage of merino wool’s natural wicking and odor-resisting abilities to offer a soft, versatile t-shirt style jersey.&nbsp; Rapha uses ReRapt Technology to create a durable fabric blend of 52% merino/48% Nylon, which not only provides snag and abrasion resistance, it also helps keep the garment from losing its shape.</p><p>This jersey features a new cut from Rapha, the Explore Fit, which moves the sleeves a bit forward and adds a gusseted underarm panel to ensure all-day comfort on and off the bike. Color options for the Explore Merino Tee are Brick or Dark Navy, sizes range from XS-XXL, and its retail price is $90.</p><h3>Women’s Nomad Collection</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Nomad women's collection\" width=\"800\" height=\"604\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection-297x224.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection-120x91.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection-768x580.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection-696x525.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection-556x420.jpg 556w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24165426/Rapha-Nomad-womens-collection-80x60.jpg 80w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>Rapha’s Nomad collection was inspired by the ‘golden era’ of the 1970’s when cycling was rapidly gaining popularity in The United States. The 1976 Bikecentennial event took racers over 4000 miles from Oregon to Virginia, and it’s that spirit of adventure that Rapha aims to evoke with their Nomad women’s clothing. As the global popularity of cycling is surging once again, the Nomad collection’s nod to the past fits just right in 2021.</p><p>Rapha says the Nomad women’s clothing line was “Made for discovery, not speed,” so they utilize performance fabrics but include practical features rather than favouring ultralight, aero construction.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Nomad women's collection, wind jacket\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket-696x696.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163807/Rapha-womens-Nomad-wind-jacket-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>The <strong>Nomad Wind Jacket</strong> is a quarter-zip windproof pullover with a soft inner fabric to ensure comfort regardless of what you’re wearing underneath.

XXS-XL sizes are available, and they come in one color with one-off patterned uppers.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Nomad women's collection, technical long sleeve shirt\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt-696x696.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/24163730/Rapha-Nomad-womens-technical-long-sleeve-shirt-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>As for base layers, the Nomad series includes a <strong>Technical T-Shirt</strong> and <strong>Long Sleeve shirt</strong>. &nbsp;The shirts are made from the same micro-mesh as Rapha’s Flyweight jerseys, and they use a gradient knit structure to wick sweat away from your body and dry very quickly.

The main pocket has a bright pink lining and internal mesh pockets to divvy up your stuff.</p><p>Quick-release buckles allow for easy removal of the bag, and the handlebar straps slide to work around lights, bells, etc. A side strap means you can also use the Nomad as a frame bag, looped to the top tube and seat mast. A hidden shoulder strap allows you to easily carry the bag off-the-bike, and the reflective webbing on the front can host a clip-on headlight for night riding. The Nomad Bar Bag costs $75.</p><p>The Rapha x Snow Peak collection, new Explore pieces and Nomad women’s collection are all now available via Rapha’s website.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/\"><em>rapha.cc</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"275a0c56c08124cab374d8dafaf05d11bd74509c97a93deb053853e8d33c6378","category":"Cycling"}
