In addition, it can offer useful contextual information in conjunction with on-screen content. For example, when moving a shape in a document or spreadsheet, haptic feedback is used to allow users to feel when it is in alignment with a margin or another object.</p><p>While haptics have thus far been reserved for the trackpad only on MacBooks, Apple is now actively researching how it can expand haptic feedback to more areas of the device.</p><p>Beyond simply making the technology more widespread on devices, Apple suggests that the utility of haptic feedback can be advanced by providing it in different areas to indicate a wider range of information. For example, haptic feedback could be distinctively provided on the left, middle, and right of a MacBook, and the feedback is said to be \"imperceptible outside that region.\" Apple calls this system \"spatially localized haptics.\"</p><p><img alt=\"localized haptics patent macbook hands\" width=\"1870\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/MsRaBPXa0KtS8STyYN00Q68uLJg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/MsRaBPXa0KtS8STyYN00Q68uLJg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/MsRaBPXa0KtS8STyYN00Q68uLJg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Yxq76yQxNRj1jyBduJk1Rg73XwM=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/916f3H6tlWCZAl_v9vwS2pb_q1A=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/c7hKu9JqhldUJgWmBLxclnnB5Y0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/MsRaBPXa0KtS8STyYN00Q68uLJg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Yxq76yQxNRj1jyBduJk1Rg73XwM=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/916f3H6tlWCZAl_v9vwS2pb_q1A=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/c7hKu9JqhldUJgWmBLxclnnB5Y0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/localized-haptics-patent-macbook-hands.jpg 2500w\"><br>Some spatially localized haptics may overlap, but each has its own individual haptic actuator.

In some instances, \"multiple haptic outputs may be provided simultaneously\" to produce a different sensation and \"alert a user to multiple notifications.\"</p><p>While patent filings cannot be taken as firm evidence of what Apple is intending to implement in its future products, they can offer an insightful look at the areas in which the company is directing its research and development. Unlike some patent filings which outline outlandish and abstract technologies that are very unlikely to come to market any time soon, this patent seems well within the realms of possibility, given that the technology already exists in millions of MacBook devices.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/apple-watch-series-7-breakthrough-health-feature/\">Apple Watch Series 7 to Gain Breakthrough New Health Feature</a></h3><p>Apple is reportedly planning to bring a new, first-of-its-kind health technology to the Apple Watch Series 7, in what could be a breakthrough for managing conditions such as diabetes more easily.
