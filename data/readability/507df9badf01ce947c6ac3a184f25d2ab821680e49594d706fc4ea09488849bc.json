Therefore, the ‌FaceTime‌, iMessage, and image capture frameworks added to tvOS in tvOS 14.5 could actually be designed for a future ‌HomePod‌ that has a screen and a camera, as described by Gurman.</p><p>The ‌HomePod‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> are able to use ‌FaceTime‌ audio already, but the ‌FaceTime‌ framework discovered in the 14.5 beta is distinct from any code related to the existing audio ‌FaceTime‌ feature. The frameworks are in the tvOS 14.5 beta and the 14.5 ‌HomePod‌ software beta available to select testers.</p><p>Gurman says there is no \"imminent launch\" planned for the camera-equipped speaker, so it's possible no such product will make an appearance. It's also entirely possible that the iMessage, ‌FaceTime‌, and AVFCapture frameworks introduced in tvOS 14.5 have an entirely different purpose that may be entirely unrelated to a ‌HomePod‌ and could remain hidden in the code or used for an unspecified feature coming to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> or the ‌HomePod‌ in the future.</p><p>In semi-related news, the 14.5 beta also suggests that Apple could potentially be developing some kind of trivia game for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, where ‌Siri‌ could provide trivia questions for users to answer. This is labeled as \"‌Siri‌ Edutainment\" in the code, but it is not clear if it will be a built-in ‌Siri‌ feature or support for a third-party product.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/handy-iphone-shortcuts/\">Handy iPhone and iPad Shortcuts You Should Check Out</a></h3><p>Friday March 19, 2021 12:31 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>With the launch of iOS 13, Apple introduced Shortcuts support and the Shortcuts app, adding a whole range of new functionality to the iPhone.
