So that's what I ended up getting used to. You know, a lot of my friends have ‌iPhone‌, so there's no purity.\"</p></blockquote><p>Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison, who was also in the room briefly, told Gates and Sorkin that an Android version of the app is the \"top feature\" that they're currently working towards and are most excited about.</p><p>In a 2019 interview, Gates <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/24/bill-gates-laments-losing-to-android/\">admitted</a> that Microsoft losing to Android as the standard non-Apple phone platform was \"one of one of the greatest mistakes of all time\" for the Redmond-based company.</p><p>In fairness to Gates, it was Steve Ballmer who served as Microsoft's CEO between 2000 and 2014. Ballmer infamously laughed off the ‌iPhone‌, but Apple had the last laugh, as Windows Phone failed to ever gain any significant market share among mobile operating systems and was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/18/microsoft-recommends-windows-mobile-users-switch-ios-android/\">ultimately abandoned</a>.</p><p>During the Clubhouse meeting, Gates admitted he had an uneasy relationship with Steve Jobs, but called the former Apple CEO \"unique.\" Other topics that came up in Wednesday's online discussion included the global health crisis, climate change, and Gates' new book \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.\" The full interview is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQFNb93q3CI\">available on YouTube</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/prosser-imac-colors-mac-pro-to-resemble-mac-minis/\">Prosser: 2021 iMac to Come in Five Colors, Apple Silicon Mac Pro to Resemble 'Stacked' Mac Minis</a></h3><p>Hit-and-miss leaker Jon Prosser has today alleged that the upcoming 2021 iMac models will offer five color options, mirroring the colors of the fourth-generation iPad Air, and revealed a number of additional details about the Mac Pro with Apple Silicon.
