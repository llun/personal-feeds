Apple is also working on custom GPU technology with 16 and 32-core options, which may be used in the new MacBook Pros.</p><p>The 14-inch MacBook Pro is believed to adopt the improved thermals of the current 16-inch MacBook Pro model, with a larger heat pipe, added thermal pads, and a 35 percent larger heat sink. This would likely increase the machine's performance potential and allow it to run at cooler temperatures.<br></p><h2>Display Improvements</h2><p>The MacBook Pro is expected to receive a \"brighter, higher-contrast\" display panel. In addition, there have been suggestions that the updated machines will be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/\">first Macs</a> to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">mini-LED</a> displays, marking a significant improvement in display quality, with an improved wide color gamut, higher contrast and dynamic range, and truer blacks.<br></p><h2>Restored Features</h2><p>Apple is also expected to backtrack on several of its controversial design decisions that were first made with the 2016 MacBook Pro. For example, the 2021 models will reportedly gain more ports to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/28/macbook-pro-no-more-dongles/\">reduce the need for dongles</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/2021-macbook-pro-more-ports-rumor/\">Prior models from 2012 to 2015</a> included a ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ connector, Thunderbolt ports, USB-A ports, an HDMI port, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, before being reduced to just four USB-C ports and a headphone jack in 2016.</p><p><img alt=\"2021 mbp sd slot feature2\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/j5eM3yVeBSGObUCGTVw1a9Z4L2w=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/j5eM3yVeBSGObUCGTVw1a9Z4L2w=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/j5eM3yVeBSGObUCGTVw1a9Z4L2w=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/6VBaCXLA2Yk2mdbMyyzV8i17S8s=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ozOyHq_vkJ7B1Piy6u_GdiLNBQI=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/BuPpIlsrdTQNHGIKdZG9x0TeXjI=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/j5eM3yVeBSGObUCGTVw1a9Z4L2w=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/6VBaCXLA2Yk2mdbMyyzV8i17S8s=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ozOyHq_vkJ7B1Piy6u_GdiLNBQI=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/BuPpIlsrdTQNHGIKdZG9x0TeXjI=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/2021-mbp-sd-slot-feature2.jpg 2500w\"></p><p>While it is mostly unclear what ports may be coming to the MacBook Pro in addition to its current selection of USB-C ports, Gurman has said that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-reader-rumor/\">SD card reader</a> will be among the restored features.</p><p>‌MagSafe‌ charging is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/magsafe-coming-to-macbook-pro-2021/\">expected to return</a> to the MacBook Pro this year. ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ connectors were used for MacBook Pro models from 2006, allowing users to easily connect and disconnect the power cable with magnets, before eliminating the feature for USB-C charging alone in 2016.</p><p><img alt=\"MagSafe 2021 MacBook Pro Mockup Feature\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/gdIB2rDK88SB9eocJgFk5JbDEbM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/gdIB2rDK88SB9eocJgFk5JbDEbM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/gdIB2rDK88SB9eocJgFk5JbDEbM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/XTyzvHsPm6lOBiSnxOtF8sX1_no=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/QIG41kz-cuX5GLkV7d_OY671q4g=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/HtdQJgFLyUSS6_aQ20B99YANYpc=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/gdIB2rDK88SB9eocJgFk5JbDEbM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/XTyzvHsPm6lOBiSnxOtF8sX1_no=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/QIG41kz-cuX5GLkV7d_OY671q4g=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/HtdQJgFLyUSS6_aQ20B99YANYpc=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/01/MagSafe-2021-MacBook-Pro-Mockup-Feature.jpg 2500w\"></p><p>Both Kuo and Gurman expect the new MacBook Pro models to be equipped with a ‌‌MagSafe‌‌ connector for charging, which is also expected to achieve faster charging speeds than via USB-C.</p><p>Finally, Apple is looking to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/apple-removing-macbook-pro-touch-bar/\">remove the Touch Bar</a> and restore the physical function key row.

However, it is important to note that this model is the lower-end MacBook Pro, indicated by the fact that it has only two Thunderbolt ports. Apple still offers high-end four-port MacBook Pros with Intel processors, and it is these more powerful machines that are expected to be updated this year.</p><p>This ‌M1‌ MacBook Pro is exactly the same as the low-end Intel <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/04/new-13-inch-macbook-pro/\">model from May 2020</a> other than its chip. Unless you are content with the ‌M1‌ 13-inch MacBook Pro, and do not care for any of the upgrades and improvements set to arrive this year, it will be rewarding to wait for the overhauled 2021 models.<br></p><h2>Release Date</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/14-inch-16-inch-macbook-pro-apple-silicon/\">Multiple sources</a> have placed the new MacBook Pro's launch timeframe in the second half of 2021, with Kuo zoning in on the third quarter of 2021. This means that we could see the updated MacBook Pros arrive as soon as July.</p><p>MacBook Pro customers can therefore expect to have to wait just five to seven months for the new models. Considering the scale of the update, which looks to drastically affect almost every aspect of the MacBook Pro, it certainly seems to be worth the wait.</p><p>We have more on the current MacBook Pro models and the upcoming redesigned MacBook Pro models in our dedicated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> roundups.</p></div></div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2fad01fd3e745ce325ad7a10b3854fc43c9c846a28aacd3177a565dde710e43c","category":"Apple"}
