More details shown in the gallery below.</h4><p></p><div><p>Who doesn’t like #newtoolday? Clearly, the folks at Pedro’s Bike Care are big fans as they’ve continually released new tools since the beginning of the year. And as is often the case with the yellow tools, most are priced right in the middle of the market, accessible to both home and professional mechanics alike. </p><p>Below are just a few of the standout new releases. And if you haven’t already, be sure to also check out the recently overhauled <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/pedros-vise-whip-ii-a-well-loved-tool-gets-updated/\">Pedro’s Vise Whip II</a>. </p><h2>Master and Pro hex keys overhauled </h2><p>Pedro’s has overhauled both its sliding T-handles and ergo-style P-handle hex keys. Both hex key types now offer a number of unique features, including easier size identification through clearer numbering and a PB Swiss-inspired colour coding system. </p><p>Starting with those P-handle keys, Pedro’s Pro T/L II handle hex and Torx set (US$100) covers 2-8 mm hex, and T10, T25, and T30 Torx and comes in a durable wall-mountable canvas holder. The hex keys feature revised handles that are thinner and said to be more ergonomic, and that comfortable grip now extends down the long legs of the keys. Pedro’s has noticeably lengthened the reach of the tool at the main end, while they’ve retained the ball end at the other end.</p><figure><ul><div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-8-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Pro T/L keys are also available separately.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-9-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The tool length has been greatly increased for unhindered access.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-10-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>A quick comparison that shows off the unique extended grip/handle.</figcaption></figure></li></div></div></ul></figure><p>The Master T-handle Set II (US$215) has been completely overhauled, moving away from the previous generic out-sourced option to a unique design that’s produced in-house with S2 stainless steel. In addition to the sizing identifiers and handy hanging pouch, these new T-handles uniquely combine the 8 and 10 mm hex keys into a single tool. The broaching on the hex keys is quite unique too and should provide easier clearance into recessed bolts compared to a number of other popular T-handles. These are expected to be available by July. Expect a review of them (and other T-handles) in the future.</p><figure><ul><div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-4-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Master T-Handles are a much more expensive proposition compared to the Pro T/Ls.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-7-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The previous Master T set didn’t include a 10 mm hex.

It lets you clean a drivetrain the pro race mechanic way and without the risk of splashing degreaser onto your rim, rear brake rotor, or into your hub bearings. </p><p>Pedro’s was one of the first on the market to offer such a tool, however, that original tool proved to be my least favourite when searching for the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/01/best-chain-keepers-reviewed-chain-clean-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">best chain keeper</a>. And I know for a fact that Pedro’s was already back at the drawing board when that article was published. Now three years on and the company has released two wholly new chain keepers.</p><p>First is the US$35 Pro Chain Keeper that works with both quick release and 12 mm thru-axle dropouts. It’s fairly similar in design to Abbey Bike Tool’s Wash Buddy or <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/01/best-chain-keepers-reviewed-chain-clean-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">Park Tool’s Dummy Hub</a> in that the pulley allows the derailleur to shift, however Pedro’s tool threads into place rather than using a quick release. The tool is built to last and is easy to use.</p><p>Priced at US$70, the new Travel Keeper serves as an adjustable frame support for travel to prevent a squished back-end (best avoided). The tool works with both quick releases and 12 mm thru-axle frames, ranging from 130 through to 157 mm in width. It’s made almost entirely of anodised aluminium and weighs just 88 g (in quick-release configuration; 5 g less for thru-axles). Better yet, it doubles as a chain keeper for washing duties. </p><figure><ul><div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-18-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Pedro’s has introduced two new Chain Keepers (use arrow for more images).</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-19-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Travel Keeper works with both quick-release and 12 mm thru-axle frames.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-20-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Pro Chain Keeper also works with both dropout types. It’s made of stainless steel, aluminium, and solvent-resistant Delrin.</figcaption></figure></li></div></div></ul></figure><h2>Burrito Wrap and Burrito Tool Kit </h2><p>Pedro’s has also overhauled a number of its consumer tool kits, including the Burrito Tool Kit and its housing tool roll. </p><p>Getting its name from the way it wraps up, the Burrito Tool Roll II has been updated for 2021. The roll now offers more interior space and features a waterproof exterior. No doubt the most neat feature offered here is the aluminium poles that can be used to give the wrap a reinforcing skeleton that keeps it flat regardless of whether it’s hung on a wall, from a tree or leant against something. </p><p>The new Burrito Toll Roll II can be bought separately for US$80, or acquired with the Burrito Tool Kit (US$260). This kit includes a useful collection of 24 tools that should get you pretty far into a number of common repairs and regular maintenance. </p><figure><ul><div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-25-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The tool kit features a useful mix of tools (click the arrow for more images).</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-21-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>All wrapped up this kit is easy to carry and store.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-23-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The aluminium poles are stored outside the roll and join to create two poles.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-24-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>These poles create an X-frame for the tool roll.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-22-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Inside you’ll find an assortment of useful tools.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-26-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>All of the chain tools are 12-speed compatible and work great.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-29-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This small wrench is handy for disc brake bleeding and rotor straightening.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-31-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The new Pro Chain Whip is provided.

Clever.</figcaption></figure></li></div></div></ul></figure><p>Common tools such as hex keys, Torx keys, screwdrivers and a pedal wrench are provided, while intermediate tools such as cable cutters, a chain whip (the one supplied has a clever trick), and even a universal disc brake tool are there too. Pedro’s cult-followed tyre levers are present as well, as is the long bristled cog brush. Also included is <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/08/bicycle-chain-wear-and-checking-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Pedro’s great chain wear gauge</a>, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/01/chain-quick-links-guide-to-easy-connection/\" target=\"_blank\">chain masterlink pliers</a>, and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/10/the-best-chain-breaker-home-mechanic-15-reviewed/\" target=\"_blank\">Apprentice chain tool</a> that will work with most common multi-speed drivetrains, including the latest SRAM 12-speed Flat Top stuff. </p><p>Contents wise it’s comparable to the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/09/feedback-sports-team-edition-toolkit-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Feedback Sports Team Kit</a>, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/02/unior-pro-home-set-tool-kit-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Unior Pro Home</a>, and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/11/park-tool-ak-3-advanced-mechanic-toolkit-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Park Tool Advanced Mechanic kit</a>. You can expect a review of this revised tool kit in the future.  </p><h2>Updated torque wrench </h2><p>The new Demi torque wrench II and Bit Set is a 3-15 Nm ratcheting torque wrench contained in a compact wrap. The US$199 price may seem steep, but that includes all the common sizes of hex and Torx bits (including some longer-reach bits), and also one wonderfully clever 8/10 mm flare nut wrench for torquing those hydraulic brake lever compression nuts. And a number of those bits can be stored in the rubber bit holder that surrounds the tool. </p><figure><ul><div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-12-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Demi torque wrench II has all the common bits included (click the arrow for more images).</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-16-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>There’s a rubber bit holder around the tool if you choose to use it.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-11-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The tool wraps up neatly for storage.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-15-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The tool is quick to adjust.</figcaption></figure></li></div><div><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pedros-New-Cycling-Tools-2021-CyclingTips-13-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This dual-sided flare nut wrench is a unique feature.</figcaption></figure></li></div></div></ul></figure><p>The torque wrench itself shares the same design (and likely manufacturer) as the Park Tool TW-5.2. This design allows finite torque control through the 3-15 Nm range, but also allows you to adjust the tool through the entire range with just a few short turns of the locking dial. </p><h2>Grease for greasing things that need to be greasy</h2><p>Finally Pedro’s has a new multi-purpose grease inbound, aptly named “Grease”. This lithium-based grease is said to be super smooth with low friction, long service life, and superior corrosion protection. It’ll be sold in an 85 g tube (US$15) or a 300 g jar (US$30). </p><p>You can find more information about all of the above at <a href=\"https://pedros.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pedros.com</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"13a7e365bd2e86076e2dd3bc6d44e1f9cfab35de697041899d4072c71faad7b8","category":"Cycling"}
