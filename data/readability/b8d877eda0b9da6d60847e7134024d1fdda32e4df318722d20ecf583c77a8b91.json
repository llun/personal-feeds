Google said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-ios-apps-privacy-labels-update/\">in early January</a> that it would add privacy data to its app catalog \"this week or next week,\" but by January 20, most apps still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/google-ios-apps-still-no-privacy-labels/\">had not been updated</a> with the App Privacy.</p><p>Google has since been adding App Privacy labels to apps like YouTube and some of its smaller apps, but of major apps like Google Search, Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and Google Maps, Gmail is the first to get the new labeling.</p><p>There is nothing hugely unexpected in the Gmail App Privacy data, with Google listing location, user ID, and usage data as information that's shared with third-party advertisers.Purchases, location, contact info, user content, search history, identifiers, and usage data are used for analytics purposes, product personalization, and app functionality.</p><p>Though most Google apps went months without an update and still have yet to be updated, apps like Google Translate, Google Tasks, YouTube Music, and YouTube TV have been updated with new content and bug fixes. These apps were quietly updated with App Privacy labels prior to when their content was updated, however.</p><p>Now that Gmail has App Privacy labels in place, we may soon see the information made available for other Google apps, and Google may resume the regular updates that were offered for iOS apps prior to when Apple implemented the new rules.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/whatsapp-fate-of-accounts-privacy-policy/\">WhatsApp Reveals What Happens to Users Who Don't Agree to Upcoming Privacy Policy Changes</a></h3><p>Sunday February 21, 2021 1:11 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>WhatsApp has revealed how it will gradually limit the features available to accounts held by users who do not accept the platform's impending privacy policy changes, due to come into effect on May 15.
