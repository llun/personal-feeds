The British automaker has a new global strategy, as revealed earlier on Monday by new CEO Thierry Bolloré. There's a new roadmap for Jaguar, which will lose its internal combustion engines as it focuses on purely electric luxury cars. Six new battery EVs are in the works for Land Rover, and the company is exploring hydrogen fuel cells as well.</p><p>\"Jaguar Land Rover is unique in the global automotive industry,\" said Bolloré. \"Designers of peerless models, an unrivaled understanding of the future luxury needs of its customers, emotionally rich brand equity, a spirit of Britishness and unrivaled access to leading global players in technology and sustainability within the wider Tata Group. We are harnessing those ingredients today to reimagine the business, the two brands and the customer experience of tomorrow. The Reimagine strategy allows us to enhance and celebrate that uniqueness like never before. Together, we can design an even more sustainable and positive impact on the world around us.\"</p><p>Under the Reimagine strategy, Bolloré said that JLR will become a \"battery first business.\" For Land Rover, there are six new BEVs scheduled to arrive by 2026, although the first of these isn't due until 2024. Future Land Rovers will be built using a pair of new flexible vehicle architectures—Modular Longitudinal Architecture and Electric Modular Architecture—both of which are powertrain-agnostic. And production for MLA vehicles will take place at Solihull in the British midlands.</p><p>By 2026, the brand will also retire its diesel engines, and Bolloré said that by 2036, Land Rover should have zero tailpipe emissions, with a goal for the entire company to be carbon-neutral by 2039.</p><h2>No more engines for Jaguars</h2><p>For Jaguar, Reimagine means canceling the replacement for its XJ sedan; every new Jaguar introduced from here on will be a BEV. Additionally, Jaguar's Castle Bromwich factory in Birmingham, England—which currently builds the XE, XF, and F-Types, and which was to build the new XJ—will cease operations as a car factory when those three models reach the end of their product life cycles. But instead of closing the site, Bolloré says that Jaguar will look at moving other activities there, including expanding its lucrative Special Vehicle Operations group into the site.</p><p>These future Jaguars will all use a new electric vehicle architecture, and BEV manufacturing will take place at JLR's Solihull factory. (Solihull currently builds the Jaguar F-Pace as well as Range Rovers.) But designing and building an all-new BEV platform isn't the work of a minute, so Jaguar's all-electric future is only scheduled to begin in 2025. What this means for Jaguar's traditional two-seat sports cars remains unclear, but a replacement for the F-Type is by no means certain given low sales volumes.</p></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
