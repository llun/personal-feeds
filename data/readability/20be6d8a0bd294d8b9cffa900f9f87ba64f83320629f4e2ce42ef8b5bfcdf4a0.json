The company mulled releasing a model to appeal to extreme sports athletes alongside the original Apple Watch, which launched in 2015.<br></p><blockquote><p>If Apple goes ahead this time, the rugged version would be an additional model similar to how Apple offers a lower-cost option called the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> and special editions co-branded with Nike Inc. and Hermes International. Sometimes dubbed the \"Explorer Edition\" inside Apple, the product would have the same functionality as a standard Apple Watch but with extra impact-resistance and protection in the vein of Casio's G-Shock watches.</p></blockquote><p>The latest Apple Watch models are water resistant to 50 meters, but Gurman suggests that Apple could make a new device more \"rugged\" by giving it a rubberized casing, making it more resistant to damage in extreme environments compared to the current lineup of aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel cases.</p><p>Despite actively considering such a model, Gurman includes the usual caveat about rumored future products by noting that his sources say it could be ultimately canceled or delayed.</p><p>Apple is also working on new swim tracking features for the Apple Watch, according to the report, although no additional details were given.</p><p>Apple typically launches new Apple Watch models in September, but rumors are thin on the ground when it comes to a Series 7 model. According to Korean site <em>ETNews</em>, Apple will add <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/apple-watch-series-7-blood-glucose-monitoring/\">blood glucose monitoring capabilities</a> to the Apple Watch Series 7 using a non-invasive optical sensor.</p><p>Other rumors indicate a future version of the Apple Watch may adopt <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/08/apple-watch-solid-state-haptic-buttons/\">solid state buttons</a> that don't physically click but instead provide haptic feedback to users when the buttons are touched, but it's not clear when this is coming.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">iPhone 13 Front Glass Reveals Smaller Notch With Earpiece Relocated to Top Bezel</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models are widely expected to feature a smaller notch, and we are able to share a first look at the potential design.
