You can essentially set any function on the Mac to be performed with a click of a controller button, which is handy if you want an alternate input method. There's also an option to create custom shortcuts that can be launched with a controller.</p><p>Note that to use the app, you must enable the Accessibility feature that allows apps to control your computer. This is available in System Preferences, and the app setup will walk you through it. Without the control option enabled, Controlly does not work.</p><p><img alt=\"controlly key mapping options\" width=\"1841\" height=\"1417\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pOgXVR-bv2m-Yx5ZJy25pqkk-A0=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pOgXVR-bv2m-Yx5ZJy25pqkk-A0=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pOgXVR-bv2m-Yx5ZJy25pqkk-A0=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/gZ2ZfqTA3dzCmxRb63xIXxAZPms=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/a-sxE6YCxBkUzIu9b9sZcG0rP5U=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/0NYdDta1V4tJUdZj5Jp7aGlscCs=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pOgXVR-bv2m-Yx5ZJy25pqkk-A0=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/gZ2ZfqTA3dzCmxRb63xIXxAZPms=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/a-sxE6YCxBkUzIu9b9sZcG0rP5U=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/0NYdDta1V4tJUdZj5Jp7aGlscCs=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/controlly-key-mapping-options.jpg 2500w\"><br>Most wireless controllers should be able to work with Controlly after being paired via Bluetooth to a Mac.
