It’s a still climb where you gain 1100m in just 13km. Typically there should be more snow at the tops at this time&nbsp;of year. The bike is a Moustache Dimanche 29.5.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
