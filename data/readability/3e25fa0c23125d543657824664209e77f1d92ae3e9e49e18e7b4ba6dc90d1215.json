Pepper may have accidentally jumped the gun, however, as the app briefly showed users a splash screen with an option to add the Pepper card to the Wallet app for use with Apple Pay. The screen is apparently no longer being shown.</p><p>This serves as pretty good evidence that Apple Pay will likely expand to Israel soon, after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-pay-launches-in-mexico/\">launching in Mexico</a> earlier this week. First introduced in 2014, Apple Pay is now available in over 50 countries or regions around the world.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/whatsapp-fate-of-accounts-privacy-policy/\">WhatsApp Reveals What Happens to Users Who Don't Agree to Upcoming Privacy Policy Changes</a></h3><p>Sunday February 21, 2021 1:11 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>WhatsApp has revealed how it will gradually limit the features available to accounts held by users who do not accept the platform's impending privacy policy changes, due to come into effect on May 15.
