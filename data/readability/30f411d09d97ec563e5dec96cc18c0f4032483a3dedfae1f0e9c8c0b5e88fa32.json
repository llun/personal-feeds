WebM allows video files to remain small without sacrificing quality and can be played with little processing power, making it ideal for webpages and browsers.</p><p>Code in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.3 suggests that Rosetta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/rosetta-macos-11-3-strings/\">could be removed</a> from some ‌M1‌ Macs in some select regions after the software is released. There's a mention that \"Rosetta is no longer available in this region. Applications requiring Rosetta will no longer run,\" but no additional information is available at this time.</p><p>There are also appear to be new assets that suggest a feature for mapping game controller buttons to keyboard layouts, and there's a Game Center toggle to enable or disable connections with friends, which lets games set you up with your friends or prevents apps from accessing that info.</p><p>More on ‌macOS Big Sur‌ can be found in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">our macOS Big Sur roundup</a>.
