Nick Fletcher, Conservative MP for Doncaster, added that Apple car production represented an opportunity for \"engaging with new, innovative industries that help boost economic growth while helping the environment.\"</p><p>Sunderland, a port city in the north-east of England, is already home to the production of the fully-electric Nissan Leaf in Europe. Marco Longhi, Conservative MP for Dudley North, said Apple could offer a major boost to areas of the UK with long-standing automotive expertise.</p><blockquote><p>\"This would be a fantastic investment for the Midlands and the Black Country,\" he said. \"This will mean jobs for people locally and it would be an endorsement of UK plc in a post-Brexit environment.\"</p></blockquote><p>Considering that the Apple car has not yet been announced, with it looking as though production may not begin for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/apple-car-production-rumored-2024/\">another three years</a>, it is surprising that politicians are already discussing the vehicle. The possibility of Apple car production in the UK may seek to counter the country's loss of a Tesla Gigafactory to Berlin, when Elon Musk was searching for a location for a new European manufacturing hub in 2019.</p><p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, said that the British government is actively working with companies to attract investment into domestic battery gigafactories, and a spokesperson for the UK government's Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy told <em>The Telegraph</em> that they could not comment on speculation around commercial contracts with Apple.</p><p>The only location that has seen <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/19/apple-car-production-kia-us-plant/\">significant attention</a> for potential Apple car production so far is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-car-kia-talks-georgia-assembly/\">Kia's West Point plant</a> in the U.S. state of Georgia, but Apple's partnership with Hyundai and Kia on the project has now been brought into question since talks were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-pauses-car-talks-hyundai-kia/\">paused earlier this month</a>.</p><p><small>Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/political-news.218/\">Political News</a> forum.
