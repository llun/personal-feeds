The timeframe suggests that the device could be announced by Apple within the next few weeks, or in April at the latest.</p><p>A new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/kuo-mini-led-ipad-pro/\">widely rumored for many months</a>. The device would still have an LCD display, but with Mini-LED backlighting for higher brightness, improved contrast ratio, and other benefits. It's unclear if the 11-inch iPad Pro will be updated with a Mini-LED display too, as many rumors have only mentioned the 12.9-inch model, despite the fact the devices are usually updated together.</p><p>The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/03/ipad-pro-5g-a14x-mini-led-2021-rumor/\">faster A14X chip and support for 5G networks</a> on models with cellular connectivity.</p><p>March is a common month for Apple to announce new or updated products. Apple last updated its iPad Pro lineup in March 2020 with a marginally improved A12Z Bionic chip, an Ultra Wide camera, a LiDAR Scanner, and better sounding microphones.</p><p>Chinese leaker \"Kang\" recently suggested that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">Apple plans to host an event on March 23</a>, and while he has a strong track record so far, Apple could of course opt to announce the new iPad Pro with a press release. Other rumored products include Apple's long-awaited AirTags items trackers, a new Apple TV, new AirPods, and more Apple silicon Macs.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/apple-watch-series-7-breakthrough-health-feature/\">Apple Watch Series 7 to Gain Breakthrough New Health Feature</a></h3><p>Apple is reportedly planning to bring a new, first-of-its-kind health technology to the Apple Watch Series 7, in what could be a breakthrough for managing conditions such as diabetes more easily.
