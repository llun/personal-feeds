We stayed in a hotel near the Duomo called the Diablo (reviews as a 4.4/10, which seems generous). It had an implausibly tall toilet, an open shower that drained down a tiled ramp into the middle of the room, and a tiny sink with an enormous tap.<p>There was a noise curfew, there were cigarette butts littered across the roof outside the window, and Andy and I would lie there in oppressive summer heat on single beds next to each other and try to understand the skin-heavy Italian TV game shows that we watched, while not speaking a word of Italian.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CORVOS_00033180-001-1340x892.jpg\"><figcaption>On the second day of our stay in Milan, we went for a walk to the Duomo. Big white cathedral in a square – can’t miss it.<p>In a brief and stressful few minutes, Andy got conned into holding bird seed, then had a gazillion pigeons land on top of him, got quite badly scratched, got shat on, and then got bullied into paying the man with the bird seed quite a lot of money.</p><p>It was the best thing that happened to me in Milan. And for that reason, I am including these two pictures of the Duomo, one without pigeons (great) and one with (even better).</p><p>FIN</p></figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7a8db835317052b038f597a73b2de719a3fdb1c7351688a34de5ce145fc3d751","category":"Cycling"}
