Victims automatically received the malicious packages, with no social engineering or trojans required.</p><p>Birsan was able to create counterfeit projects using the same names on open-source repositories, each containing a disclaimer message, and found that applications would automatically pull public dependency packages, without needing any action from the developer. In some cases, such as with PyPI packages, any package with a higher version would be prioritized regardless of wherever it was located. This enabled Birsan to successfully attack the software supply chain of multiple companies.</p><p>Upon verifying that his component had successfully infiltrated the corporate network, Birsan reported his findings to the company in question, and some rewarded him with a bug bounty. Microsoft awarded him its highest bug bounty amount of $40,000 and released a white paper on this security issue, while Apple told <em>BleepingComputer</em> that Birsan will receive a reward via the Apple Security Bounty program for responsibly disclosing the issue. Birsan has now earned over $130,000 through bug bounty programs and pre-approved penetration testing arrangements.</p><p>A full explanation of the methodology behind the attack is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610\">available at Alex Birsan's <em>Medium</em> page</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyer’s Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
