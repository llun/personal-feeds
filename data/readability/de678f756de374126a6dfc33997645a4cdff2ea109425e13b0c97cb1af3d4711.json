Most notably, the site in November shared an x-ray image claiming to be the new ‌AirPods‌, however, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/05/alleged-images-of-airpods-3-shared-online/\">later proven</a> to be faked and simply a compressed x-ray image of the current-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>.</p><p>The image shared today, however, is in line with what we know so far about the third-gen ‌AirPods‌. <em>Bloomberg</em> has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">reported</a> that the new ‌AirPods‌ will take design cues from the ‌AirPods Pro‌ by having a smaller stem and silicone eartips, but they will reportedly lack high-end features such as Active Noise Cancelation.</p><p>According to <em>52audio</em> and a provided caption of the leaked image, the new ‌AirPods‌ will feature a pressure-relieving system, the same technology featured in the ‌AirPods Pro‌. The system is meant to equalize pressure within your ear to remove any discomfort from using the ‌AirPods‌ for a prolonged period of time. Based on the image, the charging case will be less rectangular than the case that comes with the ‌AirPods Pro‌, and more in keeping with the original ‌AirPods‌ case, but with the addition of an LED charging indicator on the front.</p><p>The third-generation ‌AirPods‌ may also be borrowing touch controls from the ‌AirPods Pro‌. According to accompanying 3D renders from <em>52audio</em>, each new earbud will feature touch control surfaces, instead of the single and double-tap controls on the current ‌AirPods‌ (first and second generation).</p><p><img alt=\"3d renders new airpods 52audio\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Lz-22e3RcUY0qg7mMHMriMyB96c=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Lz-22e3RcUY0qg7mMHMriMyB96c=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Lz-22e3RcUY0qg7mMHMriMyB96c=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/JWRydJl73rIaBNfBXO2bGlqJy0g=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Wr2iAPTMXZUcQVTbwOXhgruD7Co=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/p6NnWbZnYLL94aVPxK9atFawMH8=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/Lz-22e3RcUY0qg7mMHMriMyB96c=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/JWRydJl73rIaBNfBXO2bGlqJy0g=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Wr2iAPTMXZUcQVTbwOXhgruD7Co=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/p6NnWbZnYLL94aVPxK9atFawMH8=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png 2500w\"></p><p>The new ‌AirPods‌ are expected to offer the same five hours of continuous audio playback as the second-generation ‌AirPods‌, according to the latest report. This differs from details provided earlier by <em>Bloomberg</em>, however, which claims that Apple is looking to improve battery life on the new model beyond the current five hours of audio playback. Additionally, the new report claims that Spatial Audio support, a feature currently exclusive to the ‌AirPods Pro‌, is \"highly\" probable for the new ‌AirPods‌.</p><p>Apple analysts <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in November that mass production for the new ‌AirPods‌ will take place in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/kuo-ipad-mini-led-airpods-3-coming-1h21/\">first half of the year</a>. According to <em>52audio</em>, the new ‌AirPods‌ are set to debut at the beginning of March. This week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/no-apple-event-march-16/\">poured cold water</a> on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/prosser-airtags-ipad-pro-next-month/\">speculation</a> that Apple will hold an event on March 16. He did however leave the door open for an event on another date in March.</p><p>Leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a>, who has a mixed-track record when it comes to reporting on Apple's plans, recently reported that an event on March 16 (now unlikely) will headline <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/prosser-airtags-ipad-pro-next-month/\">AirTags and new iPads</a>. Apple released the ‌AirPods Pro‌ via a press release in 2019, so it remains to be seen how and when Apple will release the next-generation ‌AirPods‌.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/first-m1-chip-malware/\">First Malware Running Natively on M1 Chip Discovered</a></h3><p>Malware specifically tailored to run on Apple's M1 chip has been discovered, indicating that malware authors have begun adapting malicious software for Apple's new generation of Macs with Apple silicon.
