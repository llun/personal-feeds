When I'm using the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger on my desk, detaching it from my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is a hassle.</p><p>I tend to use a gesture where I use a thumb or my fingers to detach it and slide it off so I don't have to pick it up with my ‌iPhone‌, and that's made easier with the MagPad on. I have a lot more surface area so it just takes the tips of my fingers to pull my ‌iPhone‌ up, leaving the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger in the MagPad on my desk without disturbing it.</p><p><img alt=\"magsafe charger in magpad\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/41idMv3dZBy-RZsClveIvKm_9bM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/41idMv3dZBy-RZsClveIvKm_9bM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/41idMv3dZBy-RZsClveIvKm_9bM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/uynUyk_TAphgZvntNwqqJ2_0luc=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2PmHvL55zb9Jel0MegPhQF0258c=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/oygF8k9JRDvVLHQxhbhZkFSDNHI=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/41idMv3dZBy-RZsClveIvKm_9bM=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/uynUyk_TAphgZvntNwqqJ2_0luc=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2PmHvL55zb9Jel0MegPhQF0258c=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/oygF8k9JRDvVLHQxhbhZkFSDNHI=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg 2500w\"><br>At the same time, there's still enough of a magnetic connection that I can set my ‌iPhone‌ down and have it attach in just the right place, so the actual quick magnetic adherence isn't impacted.</p><p>If you have a ‌MagSafe‌ Duo, the MagPad functionality is similar. It's a lot easier to detach an ‌iPhone‌ from a ‌MagSafe‌ Duo than from a standard ‌MagSafe‌ Charger just because of that extra bit of material that lets you get your fingers in the right spot to pry the ‌iPhone‌ off of the charger quickly and easily.</p><p><img alt=\"magpad iphone 12\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/3WYISmJmjIv_WnyZGn-Pn8gfp5g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/3WYISmJmjIv_WnyZGn-Pn8gfp5g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/3WYISmJmjIv_WnyZGn-Pn8gfp5g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/3Qii6cLQa5YL-647X3v1ujEQQ5s=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/P4YeKL1afa9naypl0XDGtcxZY9o=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/7T0lwEWSio46HxupKUePob9yPw0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/3WYISmJmjIv_WnyZGn-Pn8gfp5g=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/3Qii6cLQa5YL-647X3v1ujEQQ5s=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/P4YeKL1afa9naypl0XDGtcxZY9o=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/7T0lwEWSio46HxupKUePob9yPw0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg 2500w\"><br>With the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger as a desk charger, the MagPad works great to make it easier to use. Cozy says that it's also able to prevent the rings that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/23/magsafe-circular-imprints-leather-cases/\">can be imprinted</a> into the Leather Cases from Apple, but I don't own a leather case to test this out. The premise makes sense, though, because the MagPad is adding a silicone layer that makes the magnetic connection weaker to lessen the force of the charger.</p><p><img alt=\"magpad magsafe 2\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/HvVWkxNWsa71ggXXgR8acfm5G3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/HvVWkxNWsa71ggXXgR8acfm5G3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/HvVWkxNWsa71ggXXgR8acfm5G3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/i_owEWL7bCzWn3rdi6UEaMCani4=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/OdW7GoNfKvLuguyOohsn0mAySIU=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/tXEgGeM5LWi1NOd7EAfT37ORZQo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/HvVWkxNWsa71ggXXgR8acfm5G3E=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/i_owEWL7bCzWn3rdi6UEaMCani4=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/OdW7GoNfKvLuguyOohsn0mAySIU=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/tXEgGeM5LWi1NOd7EAfT37ORZQo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg 2500w\"><br>Someone who uses the ‌MagSafe‌ Charger as a charging option while the ‌iPhone‌ is in use may not prefer the MagPad, but if you use it in multiple ways, it's worth noting that it's easy to pull off when needed.
