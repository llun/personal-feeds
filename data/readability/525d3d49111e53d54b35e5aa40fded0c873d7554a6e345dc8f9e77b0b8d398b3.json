Specifically, it envisions such a system in smart glasses, where the use of built-in gaze-tracking sensors could provide an indication of where a person is currently looking, which could direct a built-in camera to record the scene where the user's eyes are trained, instead of simply recording what's in front of the user.</p><p>The patent envisions a system with one or more gaze-tracking sensors, one or more image sensors, and a processing apparatus configured to access the gaze data captured. This apparatus would apply a temporal filter to the gaze data to obtain a \"smoothed gaze estimate,\" which would allow it to determine a region of interest based on the sensors. The system would then apply signal processing to the video based on the region of interest to obtain an enhanced recording that could mitigate the impact of rapid-movement eye saccades.</p><p>According to the patent, the system would consist of a pair of smart glasses and a separate connected device for power and storage, which could be interpreted to mean an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or Mac.</p><p><img alt=\"record gaze tracking patent 2\" width=\"1224\" height=\"1584\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mz6RjZDunfZEWsoubWONQG6Z1D8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mz6RjZDunfZEWsoubWONQG6Z1D8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mz6RjZDunfZEWsoubWONQG6Z1D8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/G-tlewCSDxZxKNv5Z7L3D-V3AnA=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/d8XVwz7A8SMJkoO_jBH5brKsIsg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/nQY_1uGjqC6DnWlaTJATd_uuKVs=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/mz6RjZDunfZEWsoubWONQG6Z1D8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/G-tlewCSDxZxKNv5Z7L3D-V3AnA=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/d8XVwz7A8SMJkoO_jBH5brKsIsg=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/nQY_1uGjqC6DnWlaTJATd_uuKVs=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/record-gaze-tracking-patent-2.jpg 2500w\"><br>The invention harks back to another patent filed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/apple-mixed-reality-headset-revealed-patents/\">last month</a> in which an eye tracking system is used for detecting the position and movements of a user's eyes in smart glasses and other head-mounted displays.</p><p>In the latter patent, Apple envisages the eye tracking system being used to analyze the position and movements of the user's eyes, or to detect other information such as pupil dilation. In one example, identifying the point of the user's gaze allows for interaction with content shown on the near-eye display of the head-mounted display, while another application includes the creation of eye image animations that could be used for digital avatars visible to other users in a mixed-reality communal environment.</p><p>Of course, Apple files numerous patent applications every week, and many of these inventions do not see the light of day. But they do provide a glimpse into the kinds of technologies Apple is exploring for potential use in its upcoming AR/VR products, and based on the rumored launch roadmap for its mixed-reality headset and smart glasses, the company still has plenty of time to implement them.</p><p>The <em>Information</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em> have both said that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/11/apple-augmented-reality-headset-2022/\">working on</a> smart glasses AND an AR/VR headset, with the headset to come out in first followed by the glasses. Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes the \"mixed reality\" headset will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/\">come out in 2022</a>, with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a> to follow in 2025. The headset is AR/VR, while Apple's glasses are augmented reality.</p><p>The headset is rumored to be similar to Facebook's Oculus Quest virtual reality headset, but with a sleeker design that uses fabrics and lightweight materials to ensure the headset is comfortable. JP Morgan <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/apple-vr-headset-may-launch-in-q1-2022/\">believes</a> the headset will look similar to other brands of VR headsets, featuring six lenses and an optical LiDAR scanner to map the wearer's environment. The headset will be targeted at the top end of the consumer market and will be more expensive than others on the market.</p><p>The glasses, meanwhile, which are reportedly in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-ar-vr-headset-2022-launch/\">early stage of development</a>, are said to resemble high-end sunglasses with thick frames that house the battery and chips. Kuo expects the AR glasses to be marketed as an ‌iPhone‌ accessory and will primarily take a display role offloading computing, networking, and positioning to the ‌iPhone‌, with the glasses providing a mobile-first \"optical see-through AR experience.\"</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/03/apple-wins-patent-for-smartglasses-that-will-allow-users-to-record-jitter-free-gaze-driven-video.html\">Patently Apple</a></em> was first to report on the patent being granted today.
