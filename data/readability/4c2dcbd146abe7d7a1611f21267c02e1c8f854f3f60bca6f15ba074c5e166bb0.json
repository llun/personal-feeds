The Volta a Catalunya, a WorldTour stage race that features plenty of climbing, should provide ample opportunity for Sagan to continue improving his form.</p><p>Before he heads to the Volta a Catalunya, however, Sagan will take on Milan-San Remo this weekend. He has often started among the pre-race favorites for the Italian Monument, but he has never won the race.</p><p>“I started the Tirreno with little preparation. Milan-Sanremo will be a lottery for me,” he said. “That can turn out well or badly. And then another week of hard racing awaits me in the Volta a Catalunya. I’ll give it a try and we’ll see what it turns out to be. Another week of hard racing seems to us to be the best way to prepare for the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix.”</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4c2dcbd146abe7d7a1611f21267c02e1c8f854f3f60bca6f15ba074c5e166bb0","category":"Cycling"}
