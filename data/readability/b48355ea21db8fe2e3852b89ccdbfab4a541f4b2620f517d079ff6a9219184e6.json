Liv Racing timed their lead out perfectly guiding Kopecky to the line ahead of Emma Norsgaard (Movistar) and Chloe Hosking (Trek-Segafredo).</p><h2>How it happened</h2><p>The mid-week Belgian classic features 92.5 km of cobbles and small punchy climbs. With 20 km to go the race was full gas. Audrey Cordon-Ragot (Trek-Segafredo) set off the attacks and a series of counter-attacks followed featuring Romy Kasper (Jumbo-Visma), Marlen Reusser (Alé BTC Ljubljana), and Christine Majerus (SD Worx).</p><p>Every attack was neutralized as the reduced peloton drew closer to the finish, although Reusser made an impressive attempt to escape on the final cobbled sector with 3.5 km to go. Unfortunately for Reusser, Norsgaard and Pieters were quick to follow. The three were joined by Alison Jackson (Liv Racing) and Anna Henderson (Jumbo-Visma).</p><p>As the peloton fused back together, Movistar took to the front to position Norsgaard into the finale.</p><p>Timing was crucial in the slight-uphill sprint and although Norsgaard looked to have it, Kopecky timed her acceleration perfectly, winning by a bike length. Hosking crossed the finish line third.</p><h2>Results</h2><ol><li>KOPECKY Lotte, Liv Racing</li><li>NORSGAARD Emma Cecilie, Team Movistar <em>st</em></li><li>HOSKING Chloe, Trek-Segafredo <em>st</em></li><li>VERHULST Gladys, Team Arkéa <em>st</em></li><li>VAN ‘T GELOOF Marjolein, Drops <em>st</em></li></ol><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b48355ea21db8fe2e3852b89ccdbfab4a541f4b2620f517d079ff6a9219184e6","category":"Cycling"}
