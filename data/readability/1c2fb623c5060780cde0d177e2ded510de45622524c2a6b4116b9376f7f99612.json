Still cool, at any rate.</p></figcaption></figure></li></ul></div><p>It's been a while since we've seen a particularly long Nintendo Direct video presentation, and Wednesday's news-filled flurry of game announcements lived up to the company's reputation for surprises and weirdness. And in a tip of its hat to The Legend of Zelda series' 35th anniversary this year, Nintendo capped its first Direct of 2021 with the reveal of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, coming to Nintendo Switch on July 16.</p><p><em>Skyward Sword</em> was the only mainline Zelda game to launch with a serious reliance on Wii-like controls (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/the-wii-zapper-and-links-crossbow-training-hands-on/\"><em>Link's Crossbow Training</em></a> notwithstanding). The 2011 game required the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/08/wii-motion-sensor/\">Wii MotionPlus</a> add-on, as its swordplay revolved around precisely angled swipes for the sake of certain enemies and puzzles, and this remaster will let players relive that experience by assigning motion controls to both left and right&nbsp; Joy-Con controllers. Don't worry, Switch Lite owners: This HD re-release doesn't mandate Wii-like waggling. If you prefer, Link's sword angles and item tosses can be assigned to the controller's right analog stick instead.</p><p>Whether this control update alone will redeem the game compared to other Zelda classics will probably be a matter of taste.&nbsp;<em>Skyward Sword</em> was notorious for clinging to classic series tenets in ways that bogged down its otherwise gorgeous and accessible gameplay (a criticism that somehow escaped <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/11/review-skyward-sword-slashes-zeldas-sacred-cows/\">Ars's original review</a>). Its successor, 2017's <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, famously shattered the classic Zelda template—and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/refreshing-new-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-is-an-instant-classic/\">for the better</a>. But in general, even a lukewarm Zelda game is still a good video game, and like other remastered Zelda games before this one, it looks like we're getting a handsome and tasteful touch-up of everything—and this does particular wonders for <em>LoZ:SS</em>'s unique \"watercolor\" aesthetic, which looked quite blurry on the original Wii.</p><p>Sadly, the presentation included no news on the previously announced <em>Breath of the Wild</em> sequel, which is now <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/switch-zelda-sequel-animal-crossing-headline-nintendos-e3-event/\">nearly two years old as a concept</a>.&nbsp;Instead, series fans had to suffice with a DLC announcement for last year's hack-and-slash spin-off <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>.</p><div><ul><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1525-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1525.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1525-980x551.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1525-1440x810.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1743363\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1743363\"><span></span><p>A brief, blurry battle montage confirms more Splatoon on the way in 2022.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1529-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1529.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1529-980x551.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1529-1440x810.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1743364\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1743364\"><span></span><p>Lots of new firepower.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1542-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1542.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1542-980x551.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1542-1440x810.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1743365\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1743365\"><span></span><p>That thing probably shoots a lot of paint.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1507-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1507.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1507-980x551.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1507-1440x810.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1743366\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1743366\"><span></span><p>A mysterious opening sequence showed off the ability to customize your own character...</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1511-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1511.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1511-980x551.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1511-1440x810.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1743367\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1743367\"><span></span><p>...along with a new \"buddy\" character, aw.

Ultimate</em>&nbsp;DLC character—though this came with the twist of that series' fans are actually getting a pair of characters, in the form of Pyra and Mythra (tucked into the above <em>Splatoon 3</em> gallery). This duo from the Nintendo-published RPG<em> Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> can swap between each other as a joint character, much like how Zelda and Sheik used to work as a combined character.

Squeenix fans will appreciate quality-of-life tweaks and mildly up-rezzed graphics when this re-release launches on Switch on June 24. This announcement comes right alongside the previously announced RPG rerelease&nbsp;<em>SaGa Frontier Remastered</em>, now slated to launch April 15.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1364.png\" data-height=\"1440\" data-width=\"2560\" alt=\"<em>Project Triangle Strategy</em> will continue Squeenix's streak of handsome 2D/3D RPG hybrids, combining old-school sprites with atmospheric effects.\"><img alt=\"<em>Project Triangle Strategy</em> will continue Squeenix's streak of handsome 2D/3D RPG hybrids, combining old-school sprites with atmospheric effects.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1364-980x551.png\" width=\"980\" height=\"551\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1364.png\" data-height=\"1440\" data-width=\"2560\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Project Triangle Strategy</em> will continue Squeenix's streak of handsome 2D/3D RPG hybrids, combining old-school sprites with atmospheric effects.</p><p>Square Enix</p></figcaption></figure><p>Squeenix wasn't done there, however, as it also used the event to unveil 2022's <em>Project Triangle Strategy</em>, a hybrid 2D/3D tactical RPG that looks much like Bravely Default. This new, strangely titled game looks far more ambitious, however, with an emphasis on reactive tactical battling that allows troops to juggle foes with perfectly aimed shoves and elemental-attack combinations. In the latter case, for example, attack a burning square on the battlefield with an ice attack to turn it watery, then follow that up with a lightning storm to shock newly drenched foes. Between each strategy-rich battle, players will also be expected to make divisive choices that bring up a \"scale\" image, indicating a massive change to the game's plot. All of this won't be out on Switch for some time, yet the game's playable demo version will be live on Nintendo Switch by the end of the day.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1177.png\" data-height=\"1440\" data-width=\"2560\" alt=\"<em>Fall Guys</em> finally comes to Nintendo Switch &quot;this summer.&quot;\"><img alt=\"<em>Fall Guys</em> finally comes to Nintendo Switch &quot;this summer.&quot;\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1177-980x551.png\" width=\"980\" height=\"551\"></a><figcaption><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1177.png\" data-height=\"1440\" data-width=\"2560\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Fall Guys</em> finally comes to Nintendo Switch \"this summer.\"</p><p>Devolver Digital</p></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the presentation was rich with third-party Switch announcements. As a particular biggie,&nbsp;last year's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/fall-guys-review-a-perfect-amount-of-cheap-stupid-fun-with-online-friends/\">family-friendly battle-royale sensation, <em>Fall Guys</em></a>, will finally fill in an audience gap with a Switch launch \"this summer.\" Additionally, the <em>Ninja Gaiden Master Collection</em>&nbsp;anthology, whose title was previously leaked by a Hong Kong retailer in December of last year, has finally emerged as a real product, and it collects all three games in the series' 3D hack-and-slash era. This anthology will launch on other consoles, as well, and while the Switch version appears to lock to 60fps, we have a hunch the other versions will clock in at higher specs, particularly resolution, when they launch June 10.</p><p>EA was on hand with a gosh-why'd-they-take-so-long flurry of game announcements. Two previously released games on other platforms, <em>Apex Legends</em> and <em>Plants Vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville</em>, will each launch on Switch in March, though the <em>PvZ</em> game will cost $40, while <em>Apex</em> will launch as a F2P game. Additionally, EA announced a dodgeball-multiplayer game called <em>Knockout City</em>&nbsp;(also coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC) with a strange trailer that almost looked like a Blizzard all-stars game full of a varied, fantastical roster, only to actually mostly consist of bubbly teenaged dodgeball players. This was followed by a vaguely teased F2P Star Wars multiplayer game set between Episodes VI and VII of the film series, dubbed <em>Star Wars Hunters</em>, which is slated to launch \"this year\" on various platforms.</p><p>As for other previously announced fare: We finally got a closer look at <em>No More Heroes III</em>, with a trailer full of confusing mini-games and low frame rates, along with its new release date of August 27. However, neither <em>Bayonetta III</em> nor <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> made an appearance, despite both recently being confirmed by Nintendo as still in development. The rest of the announcement-filled, 50-minute Nintendo Direct is embedded below.</p><figure><p><iframe type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IVHbzcr1-D8?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Nintendo Direct, February 17, 2021</p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Listing image by Nintendo</em></p></div></div></div>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1c2fb623c5060780cde0d177e2ded510de45622524c2a6b4116b9376f7f99612","category":"Tech"}
