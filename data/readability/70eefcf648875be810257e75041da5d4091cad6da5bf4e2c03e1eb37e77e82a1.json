They own cyclocross teams Alpecin-Fenix, IKO-Crelan and Team 777.&nbsp;On the team are also Annemarie Worst, Inge van der Heijden, Manon Bakker and Yara Kastelijn.</p><p>The nine Women’s WorldTour teams received an automatic invite to Roubaix, as do the numbers 10 through 15 on the UCI ranking: A.R. Monex Women’s Team (formerly Astana), Ceratizit-WNT, Lotto Soudal, Parkhotel Valkenburg, Tibco-Silicon Valley Bank, and Valcar-Travel &amp; Service.</p><p>Alvarado and Cant won’t be the only cyclocross racers who could line up for a Sunday in Hell. On Jumbo-Visma we find seven-time world cyclocross champion Marianne Vos and on Trek-Segafredo the current world champion Lucinda Brand. American Clara Honsinger, fourth at the cyclocross world championships, could line up for Paris-Roubaix with Team Tibco and Hungarian champion Blanka Vas with Doltcini-Van Eyk.</p><p>Eight of the top ten riders on the UCI’s individual cyclocross ranking could line up at the inaugural Paris-Roubaix. Only Maghalie Rochette and Denise Betsema are not eligible to ride because as of today they are not part of any of the aforementioned teams.</p><p>For the men’s race, there are no surprises with the usual suspects getting a ticket to race. Alpecin-Fenix and Arkea-Samsic automatically qualify as Europe Tour winners of 2020. B&amp;B Hotels, Bingoal-Wallonie, Delko and Total Direct-Energie, of former winner Niki Terpstra, will also line up for the Hell of the North.&nbsp;</p><p>Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert are both expected to line up as current and former cyclocross world champions. From the UCI cyclocross top ten also Quinten Hermans and Corné van Kessel (Intermarché-Wanty) and Tom Pidcock (Ineos-Grenadiers) could possibly ride Paris-Roubaix on April 11.&nbsp;</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"José Been","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"70eefcf648875be810257e75041da5d4091cad6da5bf4e2c03e1eb37e77e82a1","category":"Cycling"}
