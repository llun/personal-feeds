Nizzolo’s Qhubeka-Assos team led the way into the last 3 km before several other teams took it up at the front, with Nizzolo drifting back a bit and opting to surf wheels for the final kilometer. Jumbo-Visma led the way into the last 500 meters, and then Edoardo Affini surged off the front, forcing the sprinters to react.</p><p>Nizzolo and Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) were best positioned to close Affini down. Nizzolo managed to get into Affini’s slipstream with around 150 meters to go, and then surged past as the line approached to a take a convincing win with an emphatic celebration at the line. Affini held on for second with Sagan taking third on the day. Race leader Egan Bernal finished with the peloton to maintain his position atop the GC standings.</p><div><div><p>Giro d'Italia (2.UWT) <span>Ravenna → Verona</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ea/giacomo-nizzolo-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f5e4521e6f2b6b6a612add24ed44737f25d0c3fd83f580ca92e5aeef4f2614ed","category":"Cycling"}
