Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) was second behind the world champion and Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (FDJ Nouvelle Aquitaine Futuroscope) put in a very impressive performance to take third.</p><p>The final one-day ahead of the WWT stage race Vuelta a Burgos was aggressive. Apparently, the rain in Spain falls mainly on the women’s peloton because the roads, riders, and camera lenses were soaked.</p><p>An elite group containing Uttrup Ludwig went clear on a climb 20 km to go. Near the top of the climb, Uttrip Ludwig hit out alone while behind Van der Breggen and Van Vleuten set out to chase the Dane down.</p><p>Van der Breggen and Van Vleuten caught and passed Uttrup Ludwig on the penultimate climb with 11 km to go. The two Dutch riders continued on to the finish together while Uttrup Ludwig fought to catch back on. She finally did in the final 800 meters but was unable to best Van der Breggen in the sprint.</p><div><div><p>Durango - Durango Emakumeen Saria (1.1) <span>Durango → Durango</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ff/anna-van-der-breggen-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e3979e61753edd75eceeef78bed00a988a0f438f64cea479ff9fab8c87ca93cd","category":"Cycling"}
