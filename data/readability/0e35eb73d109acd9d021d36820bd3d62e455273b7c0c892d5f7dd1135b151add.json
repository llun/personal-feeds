They have used their platforms to draw light to the many pressing issues we face in society,' he wrote in the post.</p><p>'Cycling has a problem with diversity and inclusivity. This is a fact. It is not unique within sport, but we must face it head-on all the same. I feel cycling has not done enough during this past year. Furthermore, I have not done enough.'</p><p>Geoghegan Hart went on to say he would be 'taking action with Hagens Berman Axeon by sponsoring an under-23 rider to race with the team this summer and he hopes 'this can be the beginning of a joint effort to increase racial diversity within the amazing sport of cycling'.</p><p>Hagens Berman Axeon team boss Axel Merckx praised the announcement and spoke of the team's excitement to support the initiative.</p><p>'We are so proud to partner with Tao on this new programme. The issue of diversity and inclusion in cycling is not something that we take lightly. It’s something that we whole-heartedly believe in as a program and want to help build within the sport. I think we all have a responsibility to be better.'</p><p>The increased spotlight on racial justice was spurred in the wake of the death of George Floyd in the USA last year. Across the sporting world, gestures and actions have been made in an effort to highlight injustices such as taking the knee.</p><p>In cycling, actions have been limited, with a small gesture at last year's <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and B&amp;B Hotels-Vital Concept rider, Kevin Reza.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"0e35eb73d109acd9d021d36820bd3d62e455273b7c0c892d5f7dd1135b151add","category":"Cycling"}
