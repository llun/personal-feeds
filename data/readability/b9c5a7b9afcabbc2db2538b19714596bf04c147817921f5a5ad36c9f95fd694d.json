Because this latest custom bike from WyndyMilla has got us dreaming of days with big guitar solos and even bigger hair.</p><p>When legendary guitar virtuoso and a man with an eponymous rock band Van Halen passed away last year, a devoted fan of the band and amateur cyclist Pablo from Mexico City thought it was high time to combine the two.</p><p>Contacting the UK-based WyndyMilla, which recently merged with bespoke bike brand Spoon Customs, Pablo commissioned a custom-made WyndyMilla Massive Attack bike influenced by Van Halen and his legendary ‘Frankenstrat’ guitar.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sI7XiJgt0vY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p>A guitar so iconic it has its own Wikipedia page, the Fender Stratocaster ‘Frankenstrat’ was named such due to Van Halen’s ambitions to combine the sounds of the more classical Gibson guitar with the modern technical and physical attributes of the Stratocaster to make this Frankenstein guitar.</p><p>And its iconic red, black and white paint job was the guitarist’s own doing to with the red actually being the same paint used on Schwinn bicycles at the time.</p><p>With that in mind, WyndyMilla’s in-house Gun Control Custom Paint studio took to recreating the paint scheme originally produced using randomly placed masking tape.</p><p>The paint sits on top of a custom-built Massive Attack that relies upon a TorayCA T1000 carbon frame, built to the exact specification of the customer. Produced as a rim brake model, Pablo has also specced the bike with Enve SES AR Disc wheels with matching decals, a matching Enve stem, Fizik saddle, Pirelli P Zero tubeless tyres and a full Campagnolo Super Record EPS 12-speed groupset.</p><p>And the last little detail that really sticks out is the bike’s top cap, laser-etched to mirror the tone knob on Van Halen’s original guitar.</p><p>It’s a unique bike and one that WyndyMilla is proud to have created, as owner Andy Carr stated.</p><p>‘The bike is really bold. It’s tricky to nail that without overdoing it and that takes time skill,’ Carr said. ‘I love Van Halen (who doesn’t) so it was a dream brief and lovely to be able to pay our respects in a meaningful way. The whole team have been involved and we’ve been really excited about sharing it with people.’</p><p>Below is a full gallery of the bike. We recommend cracking on ‘Eruption’ by the man himself and taking some time to flick through, it’s a beauty.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"b9c5a7b9afcabbc2db2538b19714596bf04c147817921f5a5ad36c9f95fd694d","category":"Cycling"}
