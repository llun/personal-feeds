But Apple also likes to make such changes when new hardware is coming, and there have been rumors that new Apple TV hardware could be available this year. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230596/apple-tv-4k-review.html\">Apple TV 4K</a> was originally released in September 2017, and the Apple TV HD made its debut two years earlier.</p><p>Moser has a Twitter thread that points out other changes in tvOS 14.5, including a “Type to Siri” feature, support for “Other Wireless Speakers,” and a redesigned Podcasts section.</p><p>Other features that have been revealed in earlier betas of tvOS 14.5 include support for the latest PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X controllers and a change of the&nbsp;refresh rates settings&nbsp;from&nbsp;30Hz and 60Hz to the more specific 29.97Hz and 59.94Hz.</p></div><p><em>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
