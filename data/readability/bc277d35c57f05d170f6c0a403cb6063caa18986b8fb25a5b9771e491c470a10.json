{"title":"Kask Wasabi: Kask's latest all-rounder helmet launched","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9353/kask-wasabi-kasks-latest-all-rounder-helmet-launched","date":1615287563000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>Italian helmet manufacturer Kask has released its latest aero road cycling helmet, the Wasabi.</p><p>The new helmet was spotted in the wild <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/9350/the-day-strade-bianche-finally-became-a-monument\">last Saturday at Strade Bianche</a> with riders from the Ineos Grenadiers using it for the first time and has now been officially revealed to the world by the brand.</p><p>Kask claims the Wasabi has been 'designed to be worn in all seasons by road, gravel and cyclocross riders' and is set to be used by the likes of Tao Geoghegan Hart, Filippo Ganna and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\">Tom Pidcock</a> throughout the season, and all these riders are claimed to have helped in the helmet's development.</p><p>The new design, visually, sits close to the brand's existing Protone semi-aero helmet and centres around an adjustable airflow port within the helmet.</p>&nbsp;<p>The system allows for a centralised vent within the helmet to be opened or closed as a temperature regulation measure. Kask claims that with the vent open it can decrease internal temperatures by 1.5 degrees while only conceding one watt at 50kmh compared to when it is closed.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to note, this new ventilation system does add weight to the helmet. For a size medium, claimed weight is 290g which is almost 100g north of other Kask helmets in the range.</p><p>And further to that, that weight is hit despite the lack of systems such as Mips. Again, the Italian helmet brand has elected not to use the system that aims to reduce the rotational violence experienced by the brain in the event of a crash.</p><p>Interestingly, and something we like the sound of, Kask has also utilised merino wool fabrics within the helmet's liner to aid with sweat-wicking and keeping the head comfortable in higher temperatures.</p><p>Alongside the merino wool, Kask also retained its 'Octo Fit' retention system which allows for fit adjustment both horizontally and vertically, something we found worked well with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/4736/kask-valegro-helmet-review\">Kask Valegro climber's helmet</a>.</p>&nbsp;<p>On the new helmet, Kask general manager Diego Zambon focussed on how the Wasabi is a helmet it considers to suit all terrains and seasons.</p><p>'The Wasabi is the result of continuous and careful innovation that we are committed to as a brand,' said Zambon.</p><p>'We are excited to introduce to our collection a helmet that is truly designed to be worn in all seasons and terrains, and we look forward to watching how its active ventilation and thermoregulating capabilities meet the demands of road cyclists, gravel and cyclocross riders everywhere.'</p><p>The new Wasabi helmet will be available in small, medium and large. The price is yet to be confirmed, as are colourways and availability, all of which are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"bc277d35c57f05d170f6c0a403cb6063caa18986b8fb25a5b9771e491c470a10","category":"Cycling"}
