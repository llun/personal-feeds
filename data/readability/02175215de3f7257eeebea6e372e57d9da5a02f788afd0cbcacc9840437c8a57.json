With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, Apple removed the power adapter from the box, saying that doing so will reduce carbon emissions and the use of rare-earth metals.</p><p>In December, the Brazilian agency <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/03/apple-may-have-to-include-charger-iphone-brazil/\">informed Apple</a> that selling an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in the country without a charger in the box is a violation of the Consumer Defense Code. Apple responded to the agency's concerns by saying that most customers already have spare adapters and that providing another one in the box is unneeded.</p><p>Fernando Capez, Procon-SP's executive director, offered a stern warning to Apple following the fine, saying that it needs to respect and understand Brazilian consumer law and institutions. Alongside the lack of a charger, Apple is also being fined for misleading customers about the water resistance in iPhones.</p><p>Since the ‌iPhone‌ 7, iPhones have been water-resistant to different specifications. The more recent ‌iPhone 12‌ series, for example, is certified for water submersion of up to 6 meters for as long as 30 minutes.</p><p>Procon-SP claims that Apple refused to repair devices for customers who had suffered water damage with their \"water-resistant\" iPhones, even though they're under warranty. Other charges brought forward to Apple are claims that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-lawsuit-programmed-obsolescence-portugal/\">deliberately slows down</a> older phones with iOS updates to encourage customers to purchase newer models.</p><p>Apple will have a chance to appeal to the $2 million fine.
