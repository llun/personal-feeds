And there are a bunch of cool new features: apps will now need to request permission to use thirs-party ad trackers, you'll be able to unlock your phone using Face ID while wearing a mask and an Apple Watch (which requires watchOS 7.4), and the Apple logo will be horizontal when restarting an iPad in a keyboard dock.</p><h3>macOS Big Sur 11.2</h3><p>On February 1, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3605272/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-2-with-fixes-for-bluetooth-bugs-and-other-problems.html\">released</a> macOS Big Sur 11.2. There aren’t any new features to speak of, but it should squash any bugs plaguing your new M1 Mac. Of note, the update will also deactivate the exclusion list that allows Apple’s own apps to bypass third-party firewalls and VPN programs.</p><h3>iCloud Passwords Chrome extension</h3><p>In late January, Apple updated its iCloud for Windows 10 app with some bug fixes and interface changes, but there's one feature that wasn't quite ready for launch:&nbsp;iCloud Passwords. inside the \"Passwords\" section in the app, there's a new toggle to access your iCloud keychain, but <a href=\"https://the8-bit.com/google-chrome-to-get-icloud-keychain-support/\" rel=\"nofollow\">it's wasn't functional</a>. Apple has now released a Chrome extension that allows Windows users to save and sync their iCloud passwords when using the Chrome browser. You can <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj/related\" rel=\"nofollow\">download the extension here</a>.</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by Macworld's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><h2 id=\"toc-3\">Services</h2><h3>Apple TV+</h3><p>Apple usually releases new shows, movies, and episodes to Apple TV+ on Fridays at around midnight Eastern time. You can see our entire list of all the Apple TV+ shows, series, and movies (including upcoming projects) in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3245534/apple-tv-originals-release-dates-rumors-news-actors-directors.html\">Apple TV+ show list</a>.</p><h4>The Snoopy Show</h4><p>Apple’s newest Peanuts property, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-C9hfwvLDc&amp;feature=emb_logo\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Snoopy Show</a></em>, lands on February 5 with a series of episodes consisting of three seven-minute cartoons, according to Deadline. The entire season will likely land all at once based on Apple’s prior kids’ releases on Apple TV+.</p><h4>Servant</h4><p>The second season of M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FGq5rZi1Pc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Servant</a></em> debuted on January 15. Episodes 4 to 7 are scheduled to air on Fridays in February. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>Losing Alice</h4><p>Apple aired its newest series <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfSw7G1A-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Losing Alice</a></em> on January 22 with the first three episodes. New episodes will air on Fridays in February culminating with the season finale on February 26.</p><h4>Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry</h4><p>This documentary about the life and rise to fame of young pop sensation <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KKcUr1Utvlw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Billie Eilish</a> is going to close out the month on February 26.</p><h3>Apple Arcade</h3><p>Apple releases new games to Apple Arcade on Fridays, but not&nbsp;<em>every</em> Friday is marked by a new game or significant update. Check our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3385024/apple-arcade-faq-games-price-compatibility.html\">Apple Arcade FAQ</a> for a full list of Apple Arcade games and more details on the service.</p><p>In the beginning of February, there were three games listed in the \"Coming Soon\" section of Apple Arcade: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumen/id1489903517\" rel=\"nofollow\">lumen.</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/survival-z/id1464246022\" rel=\"nofollow\">Survival Z</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wonderbox-the-adventure-maker/id1520720139\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker</a>. None of them have exact release dates, so any or all of them could be released in February.</p><h3>Apple Fitness+</h3><p>In addition to its regular classes, every Monday in February, a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3605049/how-to-use-time-to-walk-apple-fitness.html\">Time to Walk</a> episode will arrive and automatically download to your Apple Watch if you've subscribed. The episodes will feature different guests talking about their lives while&nbsp;walking outside or in meaningful locations.</p><h3>Apple Maps</h3><p>Throughout the month of February, Apple will offer curated Apple Maps Guides created in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.eatokra.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EatOkra</a>, a Black-owned business directory app based in Brooklyn, New York.&nbsp;In support cities, customers will be able to find and support Black-owned restaurants in their local communities using the guides.</p><h2 id=\"toc-4\">Rumors</h2><p>Apple rarely announces new products in February—you have to go <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/02/13Apple-Updates-Processors-Prices-of-MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-Display/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ml-dynamic=\"true\" data-ml-dynamic-type=\"sl\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2013/02/13Apple-Updates-Processors-Prices-of-MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-Display/\" data-ml-id=\"4\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1612694938918ccf\" data-skimlinks-tracking=\"xid:fr1612694938918ccf\">all the way back to February 2013</a> when the MacBook Pro got a refresh—but after Apple dropped the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3602611/airpods-max-review.html\">$549 AirPods max headphones</a> in late December, anything’s possible. There are quite a few products we’re expecting to arrive in the first half of 2021, any of which could appear on Apple’s website one February morning. We don't&nbsp;<em>expect</em> most new hardware products quite yet, though; March is a more likely target.</p><h3>AirTags</h3><p>Apple’s<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3536073/apple-airtags-faq.html\"> long-rumored Bluetooth trackers</a> have been tipped to arrive at every Apple event and announcement over the past 18 months. So it’s anyone’s guess as to when or if they’re actually landing.</p><h3>iPad Pro</h3><p>Apple is reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ipad-pro-2021-release-date-price-specs-rumours-3788259/\">minor iPad Pro refresh</a> that brings the A14 chip and 5G to its flagship tablet, which will likely arrive via press release like last year’s update. We’re expecting it in March, but you never know when Apple might pull out a surprise.</p><h3>AirPods</h3><p>Apple’s ubiquitous true wireless earbuds haven’t seen an update in more than a year, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3587391/apple-reportedly-plans-to-launch-new-airpods-models-possible-third-homepod-speaker.html\">there are enough rumors</a> that new models are in the works that could arrive at any time. After all, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3452661/airpods-pro-review.html\">the AirPods Pro</a> landed without any fanfare in late October as did the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3373515/apple-new-airpods-wireless-charging-case-hey-siri.html\">second-gen AirPods</a> in March 2019.
