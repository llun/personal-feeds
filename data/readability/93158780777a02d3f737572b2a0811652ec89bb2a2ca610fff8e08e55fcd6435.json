It is the world's biggest genetic killer of children, though almost exclusively affects boys, and a disease for which there is currently no cure.</p><p>This year's Dash, which is being called The Duchenne Dash: Around the World, will see 300 cyclists attempt to collectively ride the circumference of the world – 40,000km – in 12 hours.</p><p>Since it was launched by Channel 4 News's Krishnan Guru-Murthy as a London to Paris ride eight years ago, the yearly challenge has raised an enormous £5 million and while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/coronavirus\">Covid-19</a> meant the 2020 edition had to be cancelled, the Around the World special will be Covid-secure.</p><p>Duchenne UK CEO and co-founder Emily Crossley said, 'Undeterred by the impact of the pandemic, we want to make this year bigger and better than before and raise even more towards life-changing research.&nbsp;</p><p>'Our heart and soul, and our reason for carrying on, are our boys and men, and rare girls, living with DMD. By joining us at the Duchenne Dash: Around the World, not only will you be taking part in a unique team building experience, but be part of something much bigger: our fight to find treatments and a cure for this cruel disease.'</p><p>For more information and to register for The Duchenne Dash: Around the World, visit <a href=\"https://dash.duchenneuk.org/the-duchenne-dash\" target=\"_blank\">dash.duchenneuk.org</a>&nbsp;<br>To find out more about Duchenne UK and to donate, visit <a href=\"https://www.duchenneuk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">duchenneuk.org</a></p></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"93158780777a02d3f737572b2a0811652ec89bb2a2ca610fff8e08e55fcd6435","category":"Cycling"}
