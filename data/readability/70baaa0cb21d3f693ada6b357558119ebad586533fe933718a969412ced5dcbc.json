Developers also have access to a new integration to develop features for the Start Page.</p><p>The update also includes optimizations for using iOS apps on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs. When running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> apps on ‌M1‌ Macs, there's a Touch Alternatives preference pane that allows users to set keyboard commands for touch input alternatives, plus iPadOS apps launch with a larger window if the Mac's display allows it. Touch Alternatives can be enabled for ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ apps by clicking on the app's name in the menu bar and then selecting the Preferences option. Touch Alternatives let you customize taps, swipes, and drags.</p><p>In the Reminders app, reminder lists can be sorted by Due Date, Creation Date, Priority, or Title, and there is an option to print lists by going to File &gt; Print.

To check that it's on, play a playlist or album and then click on the three dot/line menu button in the upper right hand corner. From there, make sure the infinity symbol is toggled on.</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a> app, there's a redesigned ‌Apple News‌+ tab with a dedicated \"For You\" section and a new Browse tab that makes it easier to browse through available content.

The Mac will charge to 100 percent three hours before a calendar event's start time.</p><p>Optimized Battery Charging is designed to preserve the lifespan of the Mac's battery by limiting the amount of time that a Mac sits at 100 percent battery.</p><p>In Safari, there's support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/safari-to-support-webm-after-11-years/\">WebM video playback</a>, allowing users to play WebM videos using Apple's browser. WebM is a niche video format designed to be a royalty-free alternative to the H.264 codec used in the MP4 format. WebM allows video files to remain small without sacrificing quality and can be played with little processing power, making it ideal for webpages and browsers.</p><p>Code in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.3 suggests that Rosetta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/rosetta-macos-11-3-strings/\">could be removed</a> from some ‌M1‌ Macs in some select regions after the software is released. There's a mention that \"Rosetta is no longer available in this region. Applications requiring Rosetta will no longer run,\" but no additional information is available at this time.</p><p>There are also appear to be new assets that suggest a feature for mapping game controller buttons to keyboard layouts, and there's a Game Center toggle to enable or disable connections with friends, which lets games set you up with your friends or prevents apps from accessing that info.</p><p>More on ‌macOS Big Sur‌ can be found in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">our macOS Big Sur roundup</a>. The software is expected to see a release this spring, with spring kicking off on March 20.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">iPhone 13 Models Will 'Likely' Have Touch ID Under the Display</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models slated for release later this year will \"likely\" feature a fingerprint scanner embedded under the display for authentication, in addition to Face ID, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner and three of his colleagues.
