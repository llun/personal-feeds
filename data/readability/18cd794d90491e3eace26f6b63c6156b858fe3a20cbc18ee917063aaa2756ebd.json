So here to throw some new fuel on the fire is woom with their first e-bikes for kids! Other companies have already electrified select kids’ bikes, but woom thought it could be done better, with less weight. The result is the woom UP powered by Fazua.</p><h2>Who is this for?</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10.jpg\" alt=\"woom Fazua Evation equipped UP5 &amp; UP6 e-MTBs\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165133/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-10-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>First, let’s start with why you might want an e-bike for your child. woom recommends these for kids have already have experience riding bikes as it will allow them to ride farther and possibly more frequently. That&nbsp;<em>could</em> open up the possibility of your young prodigy tagging along for a longer mountain bike ride than they would be happy to attempt under their own power. The merits of this approach will certainly be up for debate in the comment section, but that is one of the angles.</p><p>Of course, your child will need to be able to handle a heavy bike for it to all work. Thanks to the Fazua system, these are actually fairly light in terms of e-bikes. Fazua claims they’re up to 30% lighter than the competition.</p><p>But that still leaves you with a 35-37.3lb bicycle before adding pedals, water, and any other accessories. To be fair, there are inexpensive kid’s bikes out there that are just as heavy and&nbsp;<em>aren’t</em> motorized. Also, we also assume that like the adult Fazua bikes, you should be able to remove the drivepack and battery to make the bike quite a bit lighter while remaining completely functional as a non-e-bike.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-medrectangle-3\"></span></p><h2><span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-large-leaderboard-2\"></span>Kid-Specific e-bike features</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2.jpg\" alt=\"woom Fazua Evation equipped UP5 &amp; UP6 e-MTBs control\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03165101/Woom-Up5-Up6-kids-e-mtb-electric-mountain-bike-for-children-with-fazua-drive-system-light-weight-2-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Even if your child is capable of handling the heavier bike, assisted speeds that you would find on an e-bike for adults are probably a bad idea for kids.
