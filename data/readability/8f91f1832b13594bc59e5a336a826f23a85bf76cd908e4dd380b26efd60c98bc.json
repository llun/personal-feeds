Last week, the company launched <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/intel-anti-dongle-m1-mac-ad/\">an anti-M1 Mac ad campaign</a> starring Justin Long, and now, Intel is pinning its hopes on manufacturing Apple silicon chips for Apple in the future.</p><p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/\">today shared some details</a> on Intel's future plans, which includes the founding of a separate \"Intel Foundry Services\" business and two new chip factories that are being built in Arizona. Going forward, Intel wants to become a major provider of foundry capacity in the United States and Europe, manufacturing chips for other companies.</p><p>When discussing Intel's new plans, Gelsinger said that Intel plans to pursue Apple as a potential customer, which would see Intel producing Apple silicon chips for use in Apple devices if Apple does indeed decide to use Intel's services.</p><p>Right now, Apple relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to produce all of the A-series and Apple silicon chips used in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, and other devices. TSMC is Apple's sole supplier, so there's a chance that Apple and Intel could reach a deal that would allow Apple to diversify its supply chain.</p><blockquote><p>IFS will be differentiated from other foundry offerings with a combination of leading-edge process technology and packaging, committed capacity in the U.S. and Europe, and a world-class IP portfolio for customers, including x86 cores as well as ARM and RISC-V ecosystem IPs.</p></blockquote><p>If Intel wants to court Apple for future chip orders, the anti-Apple ads the company is running now may be unwise. Intel hired former \"I'm a Mac\" actor Justin Long to create a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/\">series of ads</a> that compare the ‌M1‌ Macs with Intel PCs in a way that positions Intel PCs as superior machines.</p><p><img alt=\"intel go pc justin long\" width=\"1119\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/0rzNpG0JoCC2Scm09aRqFkS6C0Q=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/0rzNpG0JoCC2Scm09aRqFkS6C0Q=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/0rzNpG0JoCC2Scm09aRqFkS6C0Q=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/QVWZIFtdk704Egaup0hixPALfNI=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/HPWgiIxeJjay10SWIilOoxeOHrU=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/BZCbhXtWIMzFuvI34jA5f1NnZy4=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/0rzNpG0JoCC2Scm09aRqFkS6C0Q=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/QVWZIFtdk704Egaup0hixPALfNI=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/HPWgiIxeJjay10SWIilOoxeOHrU=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/BZCbhXtWIMzFuvI34jA5f1NnZy4=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/intel-go-pc-justin-long.jpg 2500w\"><br>Intel's ads promote the flexibility of PC laptops and claim that no one uses Macs for gaming. The ads also make fun of the limited ports on Apple's Macs and call them out for a lack of touchscreens. Intel has been highlighting its anti-M1 content <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/intel-anti-dongle-m1-mac-ad/\">on Twitter</a> and has even made a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/apple-launches-pc-vs-mac-comparison-website/\">heavily biased website</a> that pits PCs against ‌M1‌ Macs.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/apple-stops-signing-ios-14-4-1/\">Apple Stops Signing iOS 14.4 Following Release of iOS 14.4.1</a></h3><p>Friday March 19, 2021 1:23 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Following the release of iOS 14.4.1 on March 8, Apple has stopped signing iOS 14.4, the previous version of iOS 14.
