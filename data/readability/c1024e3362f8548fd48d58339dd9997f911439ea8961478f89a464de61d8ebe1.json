There have been rumors of a larger \"‌iPhone SE‌ Plus\" version and possible upgrades like a full-front display with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> power button rather than a Home button, but Kuo's latest note suggests the new model won't include many obvious changes.</p><p>According to Kuo, the new ‌iPhone SE‌ will be very similar to the existing model, with the biggest changes being 5G support and an upgraded processor.</p><blockquote><p>Apple will release the new ‌iPhone SE‌ model in 1H22. The exterior design and most specifications are similar to the existing 4.7-inch ‌iPhone SE‌. The biggest change is to support 5G and processor upgrades.</p></blockquote><p>The current ‌iPhone SE‌ was introduced in April 2020 and is based strongly on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 8 but with some upgraded internals like an A13 chip from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> lineup.</p><p>Kuo says that he believes that the ‌iPhone‌ user experience will \"significantly improve\" if Apple were to adopt a ‌Touch ID‌ power button as was previously rumored for the next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, but he has \"no visibility on the timing\" for adoption of the feature.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/bill-gates-prefers-android-over-iphone/\">Bill Gates Says His Preference for Android Over iPhone is Due to Pre-Installed Software</a></h3><p>Friday February 26, 2021 3:35 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates this week participated in his first meeting on Clubhouse, the increasingly popular invite-only conversation app, where he fielded a range of questions as part of an ongoing book tour.
