Matteo Trentin, however, has told <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/trentin-hits-back-at-rider-criticism-of-uci-super-tuck-ban/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cyclingnews</a> that riders were given information about the proposed changes late last year.</p><p>Trentin and Philippe Gilbert represented riders at UCI stakeholder meetings, and Trentin said that riders were sent messages informing them of the changes discussed during those meetings in November and December.</p><p>“I’m sorry to say that they need to check their emails and download the new rules. To tweet that they were not informed is easy but emails were sent to over 800 riders and I can tell you that only 16 riders downloaded the information. If someone wanted to disagree when the proposals were made, they had many chances but there was very little response,” Trentin told Cyclingnews.</p><p>“I’m quite angry about what is now being said. Previously we could have said that the communication wasn’t the best and that riders weren’t informed, but this time that’s not the case. This time it was all clear.”</p><p>“I don’t know who they want to blame but it can’t be me, Phil [Gilbert] or the CPA. Not this time. Maybe riders should spend less time on TikTok and be more proactive when it comes to making their workplace a safer place.”</p><h2>In case you missed it…</h2><h3>A beginner’s guide to choosing a road bike</h3><p>Dave Rome has some advice on what to consider when <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/a-beginners-guide-to-choosing-a-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">selecting a new road bike</a>.</p><h3>In the fight against climate change, should bikes be more like cars?</h3><p>Ronan Mc Laughlin wonders whether the cycling industry could <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/in-the-fight-against-climate-change-should-bikes-be-more-like-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">look to the automotive industry</a> for ways to meet rising demands while managing environmental impact of increased supply.</p><h3>What wireless Rival eTap AXS might mean for SRAM’s mechanical groupsets</h3><p>James Huang <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/what-wireless-rival-etap-axs-might-mean-for-srams-mechanical-groupsets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ponders</a> what the arrival of wireless Rival eTap AXS would mean for SRAM’s mechanical offerings.</p><h3>Nerd Alert Podcast: Nerding out on custom wheels</h3><p>The<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/nerd-alert-podcast-nerding-out-on-custom-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> latest Nerd Alert</a> features a deep dive on custom bicycle wheels.</p><h3>Goodyear adds new gravel tire models and sizes, goes deeper with tanwall</h3><p>Goodyear has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/goodyear-adds-new-gravel-tire-models-and-sizes-goes-deeper-with-tanwall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">added to its collection of gravel tires</a> with the Peak.</p><h3>The HPS Domestique Watt Assist Pro is an e-bike that doesn’t look like an e-bike</h3><p>Ronan Mc Laughlin takes a closer look at the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/hps-domestique-watt-assist-pro-the-worlds-lightest-e-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HPS Domestique Watt Assist Pro</a>, an e-bike that was designed to ride like a standard road bike.</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a72ddc3ecd9d5874d70ce1eb028e4de649328ad08d4f1173efcfd1c374fcbb49","category":"Cycling"}
