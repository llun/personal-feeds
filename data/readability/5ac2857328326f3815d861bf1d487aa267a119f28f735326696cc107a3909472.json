Disney has since re-forecasted and now expects to have 230 to 260 million subscribers by 2024.</p><p>With that kind of subscriber growth, Disney+ will likely surpass Netflix. Netflix <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-q4-2020-earnings-200-million-subscribers-1234887784/\">in January said</a> that it had more than 200 million subscribers worldwide.</p><p>Disney+ launched at the same time as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, but Disney has seen incredibly rapid growth, reaching 10 million subscribers on the first day and 50 million subscribers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/08/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers/\">at the five month mark</a>. In December, Disney+ was at 86.8 million subscribers, so it has gained eight million subscribers in a month.</p><p>Apple does not provide ‌Apple TV+‌ subscriber numbers so there's no direct comparison to make, but if Apple had Disney+ numbers, Apple executives likely would have mentioned it. ‌Apple TV+‌ has not been able to compete with Disney+ because of Disney's established catalog of content along with popular Star Wars and Marvel original shows.</p><p>Apple has been ramping up its selection of movies and TV shows, but it will be years before the company has a catalog that can compete with most other streaming services.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyer’s Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
