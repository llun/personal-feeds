The card can also be synced with an Apple Watch for easier, contactless wrist payments.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/whatsapp-fate-of-accounts-privacy-policy/\">WhatsApp Reveals What Happens to Users Who Don't Agree to Upcoming Privacy Policy Changes</a></h3><p>Sunday February 21, 2021 1:11 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/\" rel=\"author\">Tim Hardwick</a></p><p>WhatsApp has revealed how it will gradually limit the features available to accounts held by users who do not accept the platform's impending privacy policy changes, due to come into effect on May 15.
