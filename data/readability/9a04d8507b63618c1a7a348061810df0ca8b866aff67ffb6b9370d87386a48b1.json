In late 2020, its board of directors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/23/iphone-pegatron-150m-investment-india/\">approved</a> a proposal to spend $150 million to build its first ‌iPhone‌ manufacturing plant in the country.</p><p>Pegatron has been cleared to take part in India's billion-dollar Production-Linked Incentive Scheme, which provides incentives on locally-produced smartphones. The Taipei-based assembler joins rival ‌‌iPhone‌‌ manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron, which are already signed up to the scheme.</p><p>Pegatron has also established a Vietnam-based wholly-owned subsidiary, Pegatron Vietnam, with initial paid-in capital of $150 million, some of which was used in late 2020 to acquire land in Haiphong, where it plans to set up a production base.</p><p>The ‌iPhone‌ assembler recently drew the ire of Apple after it was discovered that the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ supplier had been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/09/apple-suspends-pegatron-labor-violations/\">committing labor violations</a> at a student workers' program at its Shanghai and Kunshan campuses in eastern China.</p><p>Apple put Pegatron on probation as a result of the violations, and while the supplier's current ‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌ business is not expected to be affected, it could lose some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> orders to rival Luxshare next year.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
