After a year of turmoil, bikes have never been more popular as a means of exploration, exercise, and adventure. But this boom illustrates the divide between cycling media/marketing and the folks actually buying the equipment. Why should newcomers be influenced by the traditional reference points? Flashpoint MVMNT riders are all motivated to challenge the status quo and change the image of cycling.”</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flashpoint-1-of-1-2.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flashpoint-1-of-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flashpoint-1-of-1-2.jpg 668w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flashpoint-1-of-1-2-650x973.jpg 650w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flashpoint-1-of-1-2-190x284.jpg 190w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/flashpoint-1-of-1-2-11x16.jpg 11w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px\"><figcaption>Photo: Dain Zaffke</figcaption></figure><p>Kathy Pruitt is a former junior downhill world champion (in 2000) returning to racing full-time in 2021.
