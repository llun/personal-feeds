Teams began jockeying for position as the peloton neared a late uncategorized ascent, and then with the pack lined out, Francesco Gavazzi (Eolo-Kometa) jumped off the front with around a kilometer to go. Daniel Oss (Bora-Hansgrohe) marked the move, however, and the rest of the field soon caught up to the pair.</p><p>Fernando Gaviria (UAE-Team Emirates) launched from afar with 400 meters still to go and opened up a gap as the riders went through the last few corners of a winding finale, but Ewan closed him down and then exploded past in the last 200 meters. He held on to take a clear win with Davide Cimolai (Israel Start-Up Nation) settling for second on the day and Tim Merlier (Alpecin-Fenix) nabbing third. Attila Valter (Groupama-FDJ) finished safely on the day to retain the overall race lead.</p><div><div><p>Giro d'Italia (2.UWT) <span>Notaresco → Termoli</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/cf/caleb-ewan-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"634d3597591e578af2317b600062faf9f4f776a0723c339b9b5c6a5880c13c27","category":"Cycling"}
