Yet, their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/03/26/enve-builds-the-complete-carbon-package-with-new-custom-road-bikes-built-to-order/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$10,000 custom road bike</a>, which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/04/22/factory-tour-how-enve-is-making-full-custom-carbon-road-bikes-in-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is also made in-house</a> in Ogden, Utah, will start delivering this summer.</p><p>Even more confusing is why their cockpit parts, which are mostly made in Asia, are currently available. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? We thought so, so we reached out to ask why their inventory is so tight for wheels, but handlebars, stems, and forks are basically ready to ship.</p><p>ENVE told us “…it’s literally demand. We’re not having issues getting spokes or anything like that. We don’t have any immediate supply chain issues. And (they think) Utah has the lowest unemployment of any state (so people can afford them). We’re looking at ways to speed it up, like opening up overtime and Saturday hours on the production lines, but it really just comes down to the number of orders and the amount of labor we have.”</p><h3>OK, but why the insanely high demand?</h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-1068x713.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-629x420.jpg 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-800x534.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-1068x713.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE_200309IM2_0170-629x420.jpg 629w\"></a></p><p>Blame your local bike shop. Or at least, partly. ENVE’s stocking dealers have inventory, and they place larger orders. But there’s also online retailers. And OEM partners.</p><p>Then there’s the bike boom. But are there <em>really</em> that many people really buying $2k-$3k wheelsets? Well yes, but we should qualify that.</p><p>ENVE won’t say how many wheels they make per month, but they did tell us that their average monthly output is up 65% over 2020 numbers. We’d guess that puts them between 1,500-2,000 wheelsets per month. There are millions of cyclists. So, really, they’re only selling to a very small fraction of the potential customer base. And, let’s face it, they make good wheels. But ENVE has a couple of other theories:</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4.jpg\" alt=\"enve foundation series am30 mountain bike wheels\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ENVE-Foundation-Series-AM30-mountain-bike-wheelset-carbon-rims-made-in-the-USA-4-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>All those stimulus checks probably gave some people all the excuse they needed to upgrade. And with the new $1,600 Foundation Series road wheels, AG gravel wheels, and AM30 mountain bike wheels, all of a sudden ENVE’s a lot more approachable.</p><p>And then there are the people that had been budgeting for an entirely new bike, but now can’t get those, so they figured they’d just upgrade the one they have.</p><p>Basically, the issue isn’t supply chains, it’s labor supply and consumer demand. There are orders on the books that take up all of the available production time until early 2022.</p><h3>What about ENVE’s carbon cockpit components?</h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11.jpg\" alt=\"enve ses ar all road aero handlebar\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ENVE-SES-AR-all-road-handlebar-11-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>That’s a bit better story.</p><p>For carbon cockpit parts, there’s a little available at any given point, but they have shipments coming in all the time.
