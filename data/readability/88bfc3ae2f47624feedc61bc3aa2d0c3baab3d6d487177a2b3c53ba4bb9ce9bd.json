Sweden’s USWE has just released their EPIC Series All Mountain packs, and they’re looking to win riders over with their No Dancing Monkey strap system.</p><p>There are three packs within the new EPIC series to accommodate everyone’s needs: a 3L, 8L and 12L model. Cycling-wise these packs are aimed at male or female MTB and gravel riders, but they’re also suitable for multi-sport use.</p><h2>USWE EPIC Series packs – Features:</h2><p><strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x484/rscb18/ng:webp/ngcb18\" alt=\"USWE Epic Series hydration pack, NDM harness\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-297x297.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-120x120.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-768x768.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-696x696.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-420x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x484/rscb18/ng:webp/ngcb18\" ezoid=\"0.32366639021010246\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-297x297.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-120x120.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-768x768.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-696x696.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174106/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-harness-420x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb18 420w\"></a></strong>Let’s start by checking out the common features found on all EPIC Series packs: The most notable element of USWE’s hydration packs is their No Dancing Monkey (NDM) 1.2 harness system. With X-shaped straps that join at a center buckle, USWE claims their design keeps the pack very snug and secure as you ride. They’ve made particular efforts to eliminate the bouncing and side-to-side swinging that’s difficult to control with traditional strap setups (and feels like a monkey dancing on your back!).</p><p>It also helps that the ergonomically shaped chest straps offer some stretch, so you can set them up snugly and rely on the stretch to keep you comfortable as you move and breathe. This harness system is suitable for men and women, so all EPIC Series packs are considered unisex designs.</p><p>As for ventilation, the EPIC Series packs all use USWE’s air-vented back panel with wave-profile pads to allow some cooling airflow. Up front, the shoulder straps are also ventilated.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder.jpg\" alt=\"USWE Elite hydration bladder \" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174024/USWE-Elite-bladder-420x420.jpg 420w\"></a></p><p>All EPIC packs come with an Elite hydration bladder, which has a slider-type opening. The wide opening allows for easy cleaning and drying, plus you can easily add ice for hot rides. The hose attaches via a Plug-n-Play tube coupling. The EPIC packs use a clip to secure the bladder hose to the chest strap, and they put clips and guide straps on both sides so you can route your hose to the left or right.</p><p>All EPIC Series packs are also lightweight (weights are listed for each below) and have reflective details for low-light visibility.</p><h3>EPIC Series 3L:</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off.jpg\" alt=\"USWE Epic Series hydration pack, 3L with pocket removed\" width=\"800\" height=\"668\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-297x248.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-120x100.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-768x641.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-696x581.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-503x420.jpg 503w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-297x248.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-120x100.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-768x641.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-696x581.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19174030/USWE-Epic-hydration-pack-3L-pocket-off-503x420.jpg 503w\"></a></p><p>The 3L pack is the smallest option in the EPIC Series, ideal for shorter rides or for those who keep cargo to a minimum.
