The quarter runs from July through September.</p><p>Kuo previously said the third-generation AirPods would be released in the first half of 2021, and a series of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">leaked photos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/leaked-renders-for-third-gen-airpods/\">renders</a> certainly made it seem like a launch was imminent, but this no longer appears to be the case.</p><p>The third-generation AirPods are expected to have a similar design as the AirPods Pro, including shorter stems, but without silicone ear tips or active noise cancellation, allowing for a lower price. The second-generation AirPods retail for $159 with a wired charging case or for $199 with a wireless charging case, while the AirPods Pro run $249.</p><p>Apple released the second-generation AirPods in March 2019, followed by the AirPods Pro in October 2019.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">iPhone 13 Front Glass Reveals Smaller Notch With Earpiece Relocated to Top Bezel</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models are widely expected to feature a smaller notch, and we are able to share a first look at the potential design.
