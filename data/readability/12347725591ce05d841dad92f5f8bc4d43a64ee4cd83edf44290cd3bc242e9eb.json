Previously, Diwanji worked at Google, where she oversaw the search giant’s children-focused products, including YouTube Kids.</p></div><blockquote><p>Current Instagram policy forbids children under the age of 13 from using the service.</p></blockquote><div data-module=\"subbuzz-text\" id=\"mod-subbuzz-text-2\"><p>The internal announcement comes two days after Instagram said it needs to do more to protect its youngest users. Following coverage and public criticism of the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/teens-face-relentless-bullying-instagram/572164/\" target=\"_blank\">abuse, bullying, or predation</a> faced by teens on the app, the company published <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a> on Tuesday titled “Continuing to Make Instagram Safer for the Youngest Members of Our Community.”</p><p>That post makes no mention of Instagram’s intent to build a product for children under the age of 13, but states, “We require everyone to be at least 13 to use Instagram and have asked new users to provide their age when they sign up for an account for some time.”</p><p>The announcement lays the groundwork for how Facebook — whose family of products is used by <a href=\"https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">3.3 billion people every month</a> — plans to expand its user base. While various laws limit how companies can build products for and target children, Instagram clearly sees kids under 13 as a viable growth segment, particularly because of the app’s popularity among teens.</p></div><div data-keywords=\"cleaning\" data-module=\"subbuzz-text\" id=\"mod-subbuzz-text-3\"><p>In a short interview, Mosseri told BuzzFeed News that the company knows that “more and more kids” want to use apps like Instagram and that it was a challenge verifying their age, given most people don’t get identification documents until they are in their mid-to-late teens.</p><p>“We have to do a lot here,” he said, “but part of the solution is to create a version of Instagram for young people or kids where parents have transparency or control. It’s one of the things we’re exploring.”</p><p>Mosseri added that it was early in Instagram’s development of the product and that the company doesn’t yet have a “detailed plan.”</p><h2><i>Do you work at Facebook or another technology company?

After the product’s launch, a group of more than 95 advocates for children’s health <a href=\"https://commercialfreechildhood.org/wp-content/uploads/archive/devel-generate/gaw/FBMessengerKids.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sent a letter</a> to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, calling for him to discontinue the product and citing research that “excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to children and teens, making it very likely this new app will undermine children’s healthy development.”</p></div><blockquote><p>\"Just because you have a platform for kids, doesn’t mean the kids are going to stay there.\"</p></blockquote><div data-keywords=\"skincare\" data-module=\"subbuzz-text\" id=\"mod-subbuzz-text-4\"><p>Facebook said it had consulted an array of experts in developing Messenger Kids. Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-funds-its-favorite-experts-but-skirts-tough-critics/\" target=\"_blank\">later revealed</a> that the company had a financial relationship with most of the people and organizations that had advised on the product.</p><p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20706250/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-chat-app-unauthorized-adults\" target=\"_blank\">the Verge reported</a> that a bug in Messenger Kids allowed children to join groups with strangers, despite Facebook’s claims that the product had strict privacy controls.</p><p>The error meant that “thousands of children were left in chats with unauthorized users, a violation of the core promise of Messenger Kids,” according to the Verge.</p><p>Facebook said the bug had only affected a “small number of group chats.”</p><p>Instagram users already face issues with bullying and harassment. A <a href=\"https://www.ditchthelabel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Annual-Bullying-Survey-2017-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2017 survey</a> by Ditch the Label, an anti-bullying nonprofit, found that 42% of people between the ages of 12 and 20 had experienced cyberbullying on Instagram, the highest percentage of any platform measured. Roughly two years later, Instagram <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/03/766507832/instagram-now-lets-you-control-your-bullys-comments\" target=\"_blank\">announced features</a> aimed at combating bullying.</p><p>“Teenagers have always been cruel to one another. But Instagram provides a uniquely powerful set of tools to do so,” <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/teens-face-relentless-bullying-instagram/572164/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> the Atlantic.</p><p>\"What we aspire to do — and this will take years, I want to be clear — is to lead the fight against online bullying,\" Mosseri <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/03/766507832/instagram-now-lets-you-control-your-bullys-comments\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> at a Facebook event in 2019.</p><p>That year, the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children in the UK <a href=\"https://www.nspcc.org.uk/about-us/news-opinion/2019/over-5000-grooming-offences-recorded-18-months/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that it had found a “200% rise in recorded instances in the use of Instagram to target and abuse children.\" The targeting and grooming of young children by older men on Instagram was the also focus of a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sloane_ryan/im-a-37-year-old-mom-i-spent-seven-days-online-as-an-11-year-old-girl-here-s-what-i-learned-9825e81c8e7d\" target=\"_blank\">story</a> published on Medium titled “I’m a 37-Year-Old Mom &amp; I Spent Seven Days Online as an 11-Year-Old Girl.”</p><p>The moves Instagram announced earlier this week are intended to curb such abuse. The company said it would limit messages between teens and adults they don’t follow and “make it more difficult” for adults to find and follow teens.</p><p>“This may include things like restricting these adults from seeing teen accounts in 'Suggested Users', preventing them from discovering teen content in Reels or Explore, and automatically hiding their comments on public posts by teens,” the company’s post reads.</p><p>While Instagram is trying to make itself safe for teens, it’s unclear how its executives believe it can make its platform safe to children under the age of 13. Instagram head Mosseri, who has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078847/instagram-ceo-adam-mosseri-swatted-2019-police-online-harassment\" target=\"_blank\">previously faced safety issues</a> at home, covers the faces of his young children with emojis when posting images of them to his public account.</p><p>“Interesting you blurred your kids faces while millions of moms/dads are posting their kids faces on your platform,” one follower wrote on a photo Mosseri posted on Halloween last year. “What do you know that they don’t about how these images are used?</p><p>Mosseri told BuzzFeed News that because he was a public figure, security concerns had led him to hide his children’s faces in those images. However, he still maintains private Instagram accounts for each of his own children to share their upbringings with his family members and friends around the world.</p><p>“I think sharing sensitive information is important to be careful about,” he said.</p></div></div></div></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"12347725591ce05d841dad92f5f8bc4d43a64ee4cd83edf44290cd3bc242e9eb","category":"Tech"}
