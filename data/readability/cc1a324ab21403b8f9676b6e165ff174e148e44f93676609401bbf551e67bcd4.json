The team is run by two former Giro winners, Ivan Basso and Contador as well as Contador’s brother Fran.</p><p>Earlier in the Giro, the team nearly won stage 8 with Francesco Gavazzi, but the Italian was bested by <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/victor-lafay-takes-giro-ditalia-stage-8-victory-from-the-breakaway/\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Lafay</a>.</p><p>Given it was EOLO-Kometa’s first professional win, Contador’s reaction is entirely understandable.
