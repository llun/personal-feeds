In addition, a sync button keeps podcasts stored on your watch in sync with those on your ‌iPhone‌.</p><p>The new playback controls include the ability to skip podcast chapters (if a podcast supports them) and adjust playback speed. These can be accessed by tapping a button in the bottom-right corner of the now playing screen.</p><p><img alt=\"2017 02 19 22 25 28\" width=\"1504\" height=\"872\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/rMkIUFG7q9TUWbszFLUJcwdSEA8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/rMkIUFG7q9TUWbszFLUJcwdSEA8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/rMkIUFG7q9TUWbszFLUJcwdSEA8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/OfHsQE-OT4-l5cEApo6hhIvzMec=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/QpxlSVae1Ys1o82uTNova2lnHRA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/8h70mHLdiWjYA-tG9twSVPgfgFk=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"748px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/rMkIUFG7q9TUWbszFLUJcwdSEA8=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/OfHsQE-OT4-l5cEApo6hhIvzMec=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/QpxlSVae1Ys1o82uTNova2lnHRA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/8h70mHLdiWjYA-tG9twSVPgfgFk=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2017/02/2017-02-19-22-25-28.jpeg 2500w\"></p><p><em>Above, the old Overcast watch interface</em></p><p>Version 2021.1 of the app also includes improved <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> support and \"tons of under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes,\" although as a result of the changes, this update drops support for watchOS 6, meaning the app will no longer work on Apple Watch Series 1 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-2/\">Apple Watch Series 2</a>.</p><p><img alt=\"overcast watch app 2021\" width=\"1656\" height=\"890\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pL9OUCbpco4VtooQrq47Ir14O-I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pL9OUCbpco4VtooQrq47Ir14O-I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pL9OUCbpco4VtooQrq47Ir14O-I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/CXa17nPQYbA9hsujd-xmGlcgwnc=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Oa3Kq7BNkYYaQq4EkkZuJmo-Izo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/dAWcugBuaCtTQNLJ5w1OgUznt9M=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/pL9OUCbpco4VtooQrq47Ir14O-I=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/CXa17nPQYbA9hsujd-xmGlcgwnc=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Oa3Kq7BNkYYaQq4EkkZuJmo-Izo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/dAWcugBuaCtTQNLJ5w1OgUznt9M=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/overcast-watch-app-2021.jpg 2500w\"></p><p><em>Above, the new 2021 Overcast watch interface</em></p><p>Overcast 2021.1 is available for ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> in the form of an ad-supported free version or $9.99 per year ad-free.
