Expanding up to 20% wider than the previous Vision Metron SL generation for optimized aerodynamics with wider tires, these new disc brake wheels are both deeper and 11-13% lighter weight than before, and even get new faster-engaging hubs.</p><h2>Vision Metron 45 &amp; 60 SL Disc wide aero road wheels</h2><figure id=\"attachment_264207\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-264207\"><a

tubular &amp; tubeless options) feature a new wider rim shape based on a 21mm internal, full-carbon hooked tubeless bead that has been optimized for improved aerodynamics with modern 28mm racing tires. The overall rims are a similar shape, but now bulge out even wider relative to the bead and get a more blunt nose shape. Vision says the new shape results in less drag straight into the wind, but also reduces drag at yaw angles where a shallow rim would typically be better, still increasing crosswind stability by 15-21%.</p><p>Tubular rims share the same outer dimension &amp; shaping, again optimized for larger volume tubular tires.</p><figure id=\"attachment_264206\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-264206\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg\" alt=\"Vision Metron 45 60 SL Disc lightweight wide aero carbon road wheels, rim profiles\" width=\"1050\" height=\"400\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg 1050w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-297x113.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-800x305.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-120x46.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-768x293.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-696x265.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles.jpg 1050w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-297x113.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-800x305.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-120x46.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-768x293.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/06154057/Vision-Metron-45-60-SL-Disc-lightweight-wide-aero-carbon-road-wheels_rim-profiles-696x265.jpg 696w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-264206\">45mm or 60mm deep, tubular or tubeless clincher</figcaption></figure><p>The 45mm deep, 21mm internal rim expands out to a max 31.1mm outside (5.1mm more than the 19mm internal 40mm deep predecessor).

Vision says that besides more accurate hand layup of the individual plies of fiber and new reinforcement at the spoke holes, they’ve also added a new foam layer between carbon layers that help improve stiffness characteristics at a lower total weight.</p><p><a
