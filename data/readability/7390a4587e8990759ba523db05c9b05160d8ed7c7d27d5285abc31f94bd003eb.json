The two iPads are expected to feature an updated A14X processor that's \"on par\" with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, along with better cameras.</p><p>A mini-LED display will be included with \"at least\" the larger 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, with the display upgrade bringing improved brightness and contrast ratios.
