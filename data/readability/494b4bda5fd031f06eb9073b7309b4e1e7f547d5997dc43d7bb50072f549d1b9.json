Because if Patrick (H) Willems is \"pretty much the Terrence Malick of YouTube\" as he claims, we'll probably quickly become obsessed with the real-life Malick, too, after a closer examination.</p><p>If you don't know Willems, prepare to lose hours of your movies-loving life on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1fG3gT44nGTPU2sVLoFWg\">his YouTube page</a> soon. He specializes in video essays explaining different aspects of films, and these essays can center on anything: story (you do want to know why <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InyKZ0F-fVU\"><em>Predator</em></a> is the smartest idea in film, right?), soundtrack (get ready to seek out many <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O8DHdJ8U6E\">Needle Drop</a> playlists), cinematography (Christopher Nolan wakes up every day to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v92uAesOimQ\">thank IMAX</a>, right?), or some combination of those things and more. It has been pretty much love since he also had to go through a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/op-ed-chill-out-everybody-star-wars-has-always-been-for-kids/\">major self-reckoning</a> over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PjlM2R88E0\">what we want from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> franchise</a> in the wake of this latest trilogy's drastic <em>Last Jedi</em>-to-<em>Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;</em>shift.</p><p>For Ars' latest \"Personal History\" episode, Willems graciously agreed to go to a hostile galaxy not so far away. \"The YouTube comments section is the place I'd want to go if I wanted to feel bad about some other aspect of myself that I didn't feel bad about already,\" he begins. He notes there are some lovely comments but also says, correctly, that the comment section below a YouTube video \"is not a place for support or encouragement.\"</p><p>He's joking, we hope. Willems persevered and ultimately shared his signature blend of comedy and comprehension as he discussed his humble beginnings in filmmaker homage (\"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhuvfJPx0Mk\">What if Werner Herzog directed&nbsp;<em>Ant-Man?\"</em></a> is :chef's kiss:), color grading in Marvel movies (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpWYtXtmEFQ\">ugly, right?</a>), and how he briefly pivoted to COVID-era Internet talk shows. We already liked this guy—he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeN_ib0q9qk\">unironically appreciates</a> <em>The O.C.,&nbsp;</em>recognizes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elXLAcl363A\">baseball makes a better movie sport</a>, and enjoys <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFXxH8f9Rq4\">plushies</a>—but now we're committed regardless of whether he ever decides to tackle the career of everyone's<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/justice-leagues-snyder-cut-review-no-longer-whedonesque-and-all-the-better/\"> favorite modern action-film auteur</a>.</p><p>Actually, wait, Willems shared some news about that.</p><p>\"Talking about Zack Snyder on the Internet is a great way to make your life worse,\" he said. \"But this spring, I'm finally giving in to TheCoolComplexity's 2018 comment and doing a Zack Snyder video. God have mercy on my soul.\"</p></div></div>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"494b4bda5fd031f06eb9073b7309b4e1e7f547d5997dc43d7bb50072f549d1b9","category":"Tech"}
