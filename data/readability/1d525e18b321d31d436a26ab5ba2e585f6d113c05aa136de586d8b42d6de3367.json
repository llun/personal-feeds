We’ve gathered four of the best for your viewing pleasure; a Home Run at Fort William from DH World Number 1, Matt Walker, Kate Courtney’s “Rising” following her strength training, the Lapierre-Zipp Collective Team Camp on the Island of Corsica, and One Minute with Katy Winton shredding her home trails in Scotland.</p><h2>Kate Courtney – Rising</h2><p><strong>From the SCOTT-SRAM MTB Racing Team:</strong></p><p><span dir=\"auto\">“Learn how Kate Courtney turned her backyard and garage into a high-performance gym, building a strong foundation towards the new 2021 season.</span><span dir=\"auto\"> It’s not all mountain biking in Kate’s training schedule. In the gym, Kate’s coach Matt ensures her program develops several key skills that translate onto the bike. From drills challenging balance on the indo board and swiss ball, to proprioception and strength-focused training, all are done to prepare Kate to handle whatever is thrown at her on track.”</span></p><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxKxdf0cpg8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;start=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/global/en/country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Scott-Sports.com</em></a></p><h2><span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-large-leaderboard-2\"></span>Matt Walker’s Home Run at Fort William Downhill Track</h2><p><strong>From Madison-Saracen Racing:</strong></p><p><em>“Matt Walker on Madison Saracen would have been rocking number one for his ‘home’ race. Yet again the pandemic has messed up those best laid plans but that didn’t stop Matt heading to the Highlands to take on one of the toughest tracks in the world on its 20th anniversary. Ride with Matt as he follows in the bike tracks of greatness at the one and only Fort William. We also want to send a massive shout out to the Nevis Range for letting us film at the track in challenging circumstances”.</em></p><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-WaRW0X7Uv0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.saracen.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Saracen.co.uk</em></a></p><h2>Lapierre Zipp Collective Team Camp</h2><p><strong>From the Lapierre Zipp Collective Team:</strong></p><p>Now made up of four drivers, the Lapierre Zipp Collective is one of the youngest and most promising teams on the Enduro World Series circuit with an average age of 23. Last March our entire collective left for a team camp exploring the Corsican trails at the handlebars of their Spicy. Through this new video, we wanted to transcribe the ambitions of the team and show the state of mind that prevails within our collective. ‘The Future is Now’ is an invitation to travel, discover and prepare for an upcoming season that we hope will be rich! Welcome to the world of the Lapierre Zipp Collective vintage 2021.</p><p><span><iframe width=\"696\" height=\"392\" data-ezsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYEsJxcjvdU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.lapierrebikes.com/gb-en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>LapierreBikes.com</em></a></p><h2>One Minute with Katy Winton</h2><p><span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-box-4\"></span>Here’s one from Katy Winton, the EWS Racer who finished her 2020 season on a high with 4th place in Finale Ligure.
