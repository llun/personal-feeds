You can see what looks to be Polanc giving his teammate a helpful nudge a little over 20 riders back in the bunch at around 2:13 into Velon’s post-stage highlights video.</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFClPBoVOGI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p>Pogacar started the stage with a 45-second overall lead on Adam Yates (Ineos Grenadiers), leaving him with a still-hefty 35-second advantage after all was said and done on Friday.</p><p>The race concludes on Saturday with another day likely to favor the sprinters, although crosswinds have already made for some action on otherwise flat days in the race.</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"772a42007cb9769287d3000a5edd96bd2f64fa9c6aeab409cb64bf0bb9945e2e","category":"Cycling"}
