According to <a href=\"https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/\">an official BioWare blog post</a>, the ambitious jetpack-combat game's \"overhaul\" project is dead. The staff that had been assigned to rebuild the game into better shape has been reassigned to work on other BioWare projects, particularly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/new-dragon-age-still-on-track-to-exist-no-release-date-given/\"><em>Dragon Age 4</em></a> and the next <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mass-effect/\"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> game.</p><p>From what we saw in the game's March 2019 launch version, EA and BioWare <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/bioware-promises-substantial-reinvention-for-year-old-anthem/\">clearly intended</a> for the game to receive regularly updated content, but negative reviews (including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/\">my own</a>) made clear that BioWare needed to go back to the drawing board. Despite some good ideas and fun flight controls, <em>Anthem</em>'s basic core needed serious touching-up before we'd return to the game.</p><h2>No more singing of the <em>Anthem</em></h2><p>Then-general manager&nbsp;Casey Hudson made a February 2020 statement acknowledging those criticisms. After listing aspects of the game that needed work, he offered a pledge to fans: that BioWare would complete \"fundamental work... to bring out the full potential of the experience... specifically working to reinvent the core gameplay loop with clear goals, motivating challenges, and progression with meaningful rewards—while preserving the fun of flying and fighting in a vast science-fantasy setting.\"</p><p>However, 10 months later, Hudson departed BioWare, as did <em>Dragon Age 4</em> executive producer Mark Darrah. <a href=\"https://blog.bioware.com/2020/12/03/a-message-from-laura-miele-chief-studios-officer-electronic-arts/\">BioWare announced this news</a> with assurances that projects like <em>Dragon Age 4</em> would continue apace, but none of that day's blog posts, including <a href=\"https://blog.bioware.com/2020/12/03/from-casey-hudson/\">one penned by Hudson</a>, included any formal assurance that \"<em>Anthem</em> Next\" was in similarly good shape.</p><p>Two weeks ago, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that <em>Anthem</em>'s \"reinvention\" development was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/electronic-arts-to-decide-fate-of-anthem-game-this-week\">under serious review by EA executives</a> who would decide whether the project would continue or die. According to Schreier, BioWare's pitch to EA would be to expand its 30-person staff to a number closer to 90 in order to match the work's scope. From the sound of BioWare's Wednesday announcement, that reported meeting didn't go well for <em>Anthem</em>.</p><p>That reassigned team will certainly have its hands full with other projects, particularly the previously announced sequels to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/new-dragon-age-still-on-track-to-exist-no-release-date-given/\"><em>Dragon Age</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/mass-effect-will-return-teaser-trailer-set-a-new-old-direction-for-the-sequel/\"><em>Mass Effect.</em></a>&nbsp;As of press time, EA only has one announced launch date for an upcoming BioWare game: the remastered <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/mass-effect-legendary-edition-4k-remaster-coming-may-14/\"><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</em></a>, slated to launch on PCs and consoles May 14.</p></div></div>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b92e7a592f99c1139fcd93efbb1d54bb90e4ec7ffb8806fbc26b7da65b81c5a0","category":"Tech"}
