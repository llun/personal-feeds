Many app developers, such as Facebook, have complied and now include the privacy labels alongside their apps, but there’s one notable outlier — Google.</p><p>Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-hasnt-updated-ios-apps-since-privacy-labels/\">has not updated</a> its major apps like Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, and YouTube since December 7 or before, and most Google apps have to date have not been updated with the Privacy Label feature. […]</p><p>On January 5, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/\">Google told TechCrunch</a> that the data would be added to its iOS apps “this week or the next week,” but both this week and the next week have come and gone with no update. It has now been well over a month since Google last updated its apps.</p></blockquote><p>One week later and still, none of Google’s flagship apps have privacy nutrition info. I don’t get it. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/12/16/app-privacy-details\">Suck it up like Facebook did</a> and put it out, no matter how bad it looks. And it’s not like Google was surprised by this requirement — Apple made it very clear at WWDC that this would be mandatory. They’ve had 7 months to prepare for this. What is going on here?</p><p>I’m curious too which other high-profile apps are out there that still haven’t submitted their privacy label information.
