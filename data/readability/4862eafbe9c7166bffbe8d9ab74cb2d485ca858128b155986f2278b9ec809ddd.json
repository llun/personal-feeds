Power was dropped with around 60 km to go, and then Pöstlberger and Shane Archbold surged off the front with a little over 30 km to go.</p><p>With the peloton at around two and a half minutes back, Pöstlberger dropped Archbold on an uncategorized rise with around 20 km to go. His advantage began to fall as he made his way up the second-category penultimate climb of the day, but he still had nearly a minute left as he crested the ascent with just under 7 km to go. Ben O’Connor jumped from the pack as it went over the top of the climb and closed to within around 20 seconds as Pöstlberger made his way up the fourth-category final climb of the day, but Pöstlberger went up and over with a gap intact.</p><p>The pack, led by Bahrain Victorious and Movistar, caught up to O’Connor on the descent to the finish, but Pöstlberger held on, taking the victory with an 11-second gap back to Sonny Colbrelli (Bahrain Victorious), who took runner-up honors for the second straight day with Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) in third.</p><div><div><p>Critérium du Dauphiné (2.UWT) <span>Brioude → Saugues</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/fd/lukas-postlberger-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4862eafbe9c7166bffbe8d9ab74cb2d485ca858128b155986f2278b9ec809ddd","category":"Cycling"}
