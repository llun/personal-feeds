The new Pirelli P7 Sport borrows their Pro rubber compound and a tread pattern inspired by the top-level P ZERO Race, then adds protective casing layers underneath.</p><p>Basically, it’s the training

tread design is similar to the P ZERO Race,but with more sipes to improve traction in colder temperatures and wetter conditions. Meaning, it’s more of an all-season road bike tire. Available in 24, 26, 28 and 32 millimeter widths, it’s tube-type only (as in, <em>not</em> Tubeless Ready). Prices start from $34.90 / €24,90 / AUS $39.99.</p><p><a href=\"https://velo.pirelli.com/en/ww/catalogue/p-7-sport/700x24c/black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Velo.Pirelli.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1a341231c203f41e0aca0793fe02977eaebb9d278f87a6529036d1d9965f7eab","category":"Cycling"}
