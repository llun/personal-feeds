The study will determine whether the health sensors and features in the Apple Watch, including the Blood Oxygen app and mobility metrics, can provide early warning signs, and whether patients can perform traditionally clinic-based assessments in their own homes.</p><p>Patients from the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre will be asked to participate in a three month active monitoring study, with each patient using an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, which is the Apple Watch model that offers the Blood Oxygen app.</p><p>Apple's vice president of Health, Sumbul Desai, said that studies like this and heart health insights have an important role in the evolution of the Apple Watch.</p><blockquote><p>\"Surfacing heart health insights has played a key role in the evolution of Apple Watch and we're continually humbled by the responses we hear from users on the impact it has had on their lives,\" says Dr. Sumbul Desai, Apple's vice president of Health. \"We're thrilled to be collaborating with UHN and Dr. Heather Ross to better understand how the powerful sensors in Apple Watch can potentially help patients better manage heart failure, from the comfort of their own home.\"</p></blockquote><p>Dr. Ross, who is leading the study, said that she believes that biometric data from the Apple Watch \"may provide comparable, precise, and accurate measurements of fitness, prognostic markers and early warning signals, compared to traditional diagnostics.\"</p><p>The Apple Watch has been the subject of multiple heart-related studies in the past, including a study Apple did <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/apple-heart-study-stanford-results/\">in partnership with Stanford Medicine</a> to determine whether the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation.</p><p>The study determined that the Apple Watch can indeed detect irregular heart rhythms, and the Apple Watch has a built-in feature in many countries that allows it to alert wearers when an abnormal heart rhythm is detected. Other Apple Watch-related studies are under way, focusing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-watch-health-research-studies/\">on asthma</a>, heart failure, early detection of COVID-19, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/biogen-apple-watch-iphone-cognitive-health-study/\">cognitive decline</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
