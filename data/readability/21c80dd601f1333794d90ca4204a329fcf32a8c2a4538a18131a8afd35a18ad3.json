{"title":"Spotlight: MAAP x 100% Glendale sunglasses","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/maap-x-100-glendale-sunglasses-review-spotlight/","date":1613605270000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p><em>Spotlight is a new series on CyclingTips that we’re using to briefly showcase new products we’ve just received, and/or products that require just a short review. This regular and short-form tech coverage replaces our previous <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/tech-round-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tech Round-Up series</a>.</em></p><hr><p>The Australian clothing label, MAAP, is no stranger to limited-run collaborations with other brands. They’ve done shoes with Swiss-based Suplest, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/12/best-cycling-phone-wallets-cases-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">phone wallets with Bellroy</a>, kits with some niche brand called <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2015/06/maap-x-cyclingtips-collab-the-echappee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CyclingTips</a>, and sunglasses with 100%. That sunglass collaboration previously brought unique branding and colourways to a limited number of the 100% S3 shades, and now MAAP and 100% have repeated the process, this time with the Glendale model.&nbsp;</p><p>From a functional point of the view these are the regular 100% Glendale sunglasses with the company’s clarity-boosting Hiper lens. There’s no unique tech or special features to be found that you wouldn’t get with the regular 100% Glendale Hiper. What’s different is the two unique colourways – coral or blue (pictured) – both of which feature MAAP branding along the top of the frame and in the centre of the lenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its initial launch in 2018 with Peter Sagan, this is my first time wearing the 100% Glendale, and first impressions are that these shades are enormous, but hey, that’s the trend. The low-slung arms offer a unique, retro-styled look while that lens provides a huge amount of coverage for a visor-like outlook on the world.&nbsp;</p><p>That mega-size does mean these aren’t the lightest things (40 g), but surprisingly they manage to go by unnoticed once in place. There are lower vents that help stave off fogging issues, while the lens features a repelling coating, too. The frame offers a flexible top section for surprisingly easy lens swapping, and 100% includes an additional clear lens in the quality hard case.&nbsp;</p><p>The temple arms are long and aren’t adjustable in fit so I expect some people will suffer helmet interference issues. The only fitment customisation is through the two sizes of nose piece supplied. Despite being absolutely massive in presence, I’ve found these glasses surprisingly comfortable on my (fairly small) face with a more secure hold than the Oakley Jawbreaker.&nbsp;The big question is whether the style they offer is something you’re after.</p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> US$220 / AU$289</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 40 g</li><li><strong>More information:</strong> <a href=\"https://maap.cc/collections/cycling-sunglasses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">maap.cc</a></li></ul><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"21c80dd601f1333794d90ca4204a329fcf32a8c2a4538a18131a8afd35a18ad3","category":"Cycling"}
