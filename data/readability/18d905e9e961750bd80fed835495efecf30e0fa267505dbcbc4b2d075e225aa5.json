I grew up in a family of old-school roadies, so I am deeply interested in cycling history and draw strength and inspiration from the major characters of the most beautiful sport in the world,” he says.</span></p><p><span>“When you reach a certain level in cycling, improvements become harder to find. I began paying attention to nutrition. As soon as I left home, I fell in love with cooking and experiencing new flavours (my parents are terrible cooks). I discovered parallels between cycling and cooking: they bring people together, open your mind, inspire you to travel, focus your attention, challenge you to look for continuous improvement.\"</span></p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/introducing-issue-102-true-grit\"><span>Introducing Issue 102 of Rouleur: find out more about the True Grit edition</span></a></em></p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/DAD_AND_DE_CANNIBAL_1024x1024_b19754ae-7112-4a24-bb72-06c4e3204e6f_1024x1024.jpg?v=1615392579\" alt=\"Merckx and Steven Winter at Eastway\"></p><p><i><span>Gareth’s dad Steven with Eddy Merckx at Eastway</span></i></p><p>\"To celebrate Eddy's career on our first weekend, LeBlanq's Directeur Culinaire, Ashley Palmer-Watts is teaming up with Raymond Blanc to create a seven-course Tour de Feast.\"</p><p>For a story in issue 102 Rouleur, we paired seven Merckx stories to go alongside the delectable dishes. Who better than LeBlanq's Directeur Sportif Sean Yates and Sir Bradley Wiggins to talk about them and the great man? “Eddy played a role in Sean’s career, Sean and Eddy played a role in Brad’s, and the three of them have inspired countless cyclists around the world,” Gareth says.</p><p>\"We set up a Zoom call with Sean, Brad and Ash; I don't think I have ever laughed so much. It would be selfish not to share our conversations with the cycling community. This is exactly why LeBlanq exists – to bring people together. About 95% of our Zoom call was hilariously off topic – Brad’s impressions are brilliant – and he even let a few funny stories about Sean slip out.”</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Iel6KdK-PI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p><span>As for illustrating the article, a lot of the old photographs of Merckx have all been seen before.
