Between aerodynamics, efficiency, transitions, and all manner of “what ifs” across a multi-discipline sport, there are a great many details that can be game-changers in a race. The brakes you run on your bike are one of those details that really matter, especially over longer distances. British brand Ribble addresses this with their new Ultra Tri Disc.</span></p><p><span>Ribble’s new Ultra Tri Disc bike brings all the aerodynamics and power of the rim brake Ultra Tri setup with the added braking efficiency and improved control you get with disc brakes.</span></p><p><span>Whether rolling over wet surfaces or on roads where your wheels are bound to pick up dust and grime, disc brakes remain reliable and consistent, leaving more time for riders to focus on pedaling, posture and breathing, instead of fretting over what might happen when they squeeze the brake levers.</span></p><h2><span>Ultra Tri Disc: The New Design</span></h2><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto.jpeg\" alt=\"Ribble Ultra Tri Disc: rear disc brake\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto.jpeg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-630x420.jpeg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto.jpeg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30092623/mxw_3000f_auto-630x420.jpeg 630w\"></p><p><span><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/06/ribble-drop-10-5kg-carbon-endurance-sl-e-hero-plus-all-new-aluminium-e-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ribble</a> says the Ultra Tri Disc is their fastest bike ever. The frame is built from advanced-grade carbon that has been carefully sculpted for maximum aerodynamic efficiency. It features adjustability that helps riders find the perfect fit and position to keep the hammer down over long distances. The disc brake option allows for better control, especially over more technical courses, where even slight touches on the brake can cost precious seconds.</span></p><p><span>The Ribble Ultra Tri Disc incorporates storage and hydration systems into the frame to maximize aerodynamic efficiency.&nbsp; In testing, the bike fitted with a triathlon accessory pack, had as much as 30% less drag compared to the base Ultra TT.&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p>The Ultra Tri Disc fitted with the Triathlon accessory pack demonstrated up to a 30.1% total bike drag saving vs the base Ultra TT and standard hydration and storage systems. The final CFD and real-world testing showed a total bike and rider drag saving of up to 2.2% and an average of 1.3% across a -15 to +15 degree YAW sweep versus the initial prototype and benchmark. <span>Over a 25-mile flat course at 29 mph, the bike shaved off 25 seconds, ribble claims.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Ribble adapted the aerodynamics for the new disc brake setup with a newly designed fork that moves air past the front caliper to provide an aerodynamic edge over rim brakes.</span></p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3.jpeg\" alt=\"Ribble Ultra Tri Disc Front End\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3.jpeg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-630x420.jpeg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3.jpeg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/30093247/mxw_3000f_auto-3-630x420.jpeg 630w\"></p><h2><span>Builds and Pricing</span></h2><p><span>Ribble lists the Ultra Tri Disc frameset at an MSRP of $4,013.
