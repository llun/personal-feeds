There is also lots of anticipation surrounding next-generation Apple silicon given the already-impressive performance of the M1 chip in lower-end machines like the MacBook Air and base model 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p><p>Since 2016, the MacBook Pro has only been equipped with Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack, forcing users to purchase adapters or docks to gain access to an HDMI port, SD card reader, USB-A ports, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/2021-macbook-pro-more-ports-rumor/\">other connectivity offered on older MacBook Pro models</a>. Apple touted its \"thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever,\" but the decision was criticized by many users and became known as \"dongle hell.\"</p><p>It's unclear exactly when Apple would announce the new MacBook Pro models. The \"second half of 2021\" timeframe could refer to a fall unveiling in September, October, or November, but the new MacBook Pro models could also be announced at WWDC in June and then begin shipping in July, which falls within the second half of the year. The timeframe given by Kuo is simply too broad to pinpoint an exact launch at this time.</p><p>Apple is also widely rumored to be planning a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/mini-led-ipad-pro-macbooks-ennostar/\">new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display</a> for release in the first half of 2021, with some reports having claimed that the device could be announced as early as March.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">Kuo: New MacBook Pro Models With HDMI Port and SD Card Reader to Launch Later This Year</a></h3><p>Monday February 22, 2021 8:52 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple plans to release two new MacBook Pro models equipped with an HDMI port and SD card reader in the second half of 2021, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who outlined his expectations in a research note obtained by MacRumors.
