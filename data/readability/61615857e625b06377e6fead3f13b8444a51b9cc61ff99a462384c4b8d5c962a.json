Photo: Cor Vos</h4><p></p><div><p>Following Nacer Bouhanni’s disqualification for unsafe sprinting at Cholet-Pays de la Loire on Sunday, the UCI has referred the matter to its Disciplinary Commission, demanding the “imposition of sanctions that are appropriate to the seriousness of the action,” the governing body said in a statement.</p><p>In the sprint final of Cholet-Pays de la Loire, Bouhanni swung hard left against neo-pro sprinter Jake Stewart (Groupama-FDJ), shoving him against the left-side barrier. Stewart managed to keep himself upright but was pushed backwards and out of contention in the sprint.</p><p>The Disciplinary Commission has considerably leeway in determining the proper punishment for such actions, ranging from a fine to long suspensions, as seen in the case of Dylan Groenewegen, who is currently serving a nine-month ban for a similar incident with far great consequences at the Tour of Poland.</p><p>Bouhanni has a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/nacer-bouhanni-is-still-a-terror/\">long list of altercations</a> on his resume, including a “violent altercation” with his own director and a physical fight with Rudy Barbier, another sprinter.</p><p>Stewart went to Twitter Sunday evening to express his distaste at Bouhanni’s maneuver.</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"61615857e625b06377e6fead3f13b8444a51b9cc61ff99a462384c4b8d5c962a","category":"Cycling"}
