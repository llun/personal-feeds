When the unlock happens, you'll feel a haptic buzz and will receive a notification on the Apple Watch informing you that the unlocking procedure was successful, similar to how it works when unlocking a Mac with an Apple Watch.</p><p>As noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-face-id-mask-fitness-plus-developer-beta-182712559.html\">Engadget</a></em>, this feature must be manually enabled to use it, and there's also an option to lock the ‌iPhone‌ from the Apple Watch.
