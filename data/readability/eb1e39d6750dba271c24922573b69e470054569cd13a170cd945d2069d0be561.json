Renewed is the cheapest option and starts at $170 for an ‌iPhone‌ 8 with 64GB storage, while Renewed Premium is a bit more expensive. It's worth noting that prices on Renewed and Renewed Premium devices do fluctuate, and sometimes the Premium versions go out of stock. Apple doesn't offer a new ‌iPhone‌ 8 anymore, but for comparison's sake, charges $339 for a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-8\">Refurbished version</a>.</p><p><img alt=\"amazon refurbished iphone checklist\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/K4GEBR4gkwFaDj8CJKhc8nwK5Us=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/K4GEBR4gkwFaDj8CJKhc8nwK5Us=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/K4GEBR4gkwFaDj8CJKhc8nwK5Us=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/hY7VUTTFSMEeKG823cmOFbU7dOw=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/A9mcv0DxIcG_pkCs6BHATzZjRcA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Z4206sPUEZjXxxtQQsXFIUiPDX4=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/K4GEBR4gkwFaDj8CJKhc8nwK5Us=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/hY7VUTTFSMEeKG823cmOFbU7dOw=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/A9mcv0DxIcG_pkCs6BHATzZjRcA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Z4206sPUEZjXxxtQQsXFIUiPDX4=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg 2500w\"><br>Amazon says that its Renewed devices have no \"visible cosmetic imperfections\" when held at an arm's length and a battery capacity that exceeds 80 percent relative to a new device, while Renewed Premium versions are \"certified to work and look like new,\" so we chose the Premium option to get as close as possible to new ‌iPhone‌ 8.</p><p>The ‌iPhone‌ 8 that we received from Amazon looks and feels like a new device, but it did ship with a non-factory charger and Lightning cable.

Over the course of a few days of usage, we ran into an issue with the speaker. At loud volumes, it sounds off with a noticeable crackling, which was not a problem with an original launch day ‌iPhone‌ 8 that we had on hand.
