On Wednesday, the company signed an agreement with Proterra, a leading US commercial EV manufacturer. The deal was the last piece of the puzzle that, now complete, will see Volta's 16-tonne (35,000lb) Volta Zero truck move forward. In 2020, Volta Trucks signed a deal with a Michigan-based company called Meritor, which will supply the Zero's electric motors.</p><p>\"I'm delighted to welcome Proterra—a world-class innovative engineering partner—to the supply chain for the Volta Zero. When talking to our extensive group of customers, vehicle range is uppermost in their minds as it sits at the heart of the vehicle's ability to deliver for them. It was therefore imperative that we work with an industry-leader to ensure the quality, longevity, and safe performance of the battery. Proterra's cutting-edge but well-proven battery technology perfectly delivers all of this for us and our customers,\" said Rob Fowler, CEO of Volta Trucks.</p><p>The Zero is designed for city deliveries, and Proterra's battery pack should give the vehicle a range of 124 miles (200km), which is more than sufficient for a day's work in stop-start, low-speed traffic.</p><p>Perhaps inspired by its fellow Swedes over at Volvo, Volta Trucks also wants its products to be the safest large commercial vehicles on the market. Being battery electric helps in this regard, the company says; the lack of an internal combustion engine means the driver can sit much lower to the road, and the truck is designed with a central driving position and panoramic windshield to give excellent visibility.</p><p>Customer trials of the Zero are due to begin by year's end, with the company focusing initially on London and Paris, as those cities have increasingly stringent vehicle pollution controls. Series production should happen in 2022, and Volta Trucks says that it has already sold 1,000 Zeros to Europe's largest truck rental company.</p></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
