And, what are brands doing to improve in this area in future?</strong></p><p><strong>Guerrilla Gravity:</strong> Carbon fiber frames can be recycled, it’s just a matter of how much work is required to recycle the material and how useful the recycled product is after the process is completed.</p><p><a

factory) and the second is end-of-life product recycling (i.e. not throwing harvestable material away after its useful life).</p><p>There are also two types of carbon fiber composites in the bike industry: traditional thermoset resin carbon composite (what essentially all “carbon” products are made of today) and the new thermoplastic resin carbon composite (the first modern application of

up, then the partially cured resin is chemically stripped, which results in dry chopped carbon fibers. The fibers are then ground up to ~1mm long, added to thermoplastic resin as a reinforcement for thermoplastic pellets suited for injection molding.</p><p>That material can then be used to make injection molded parts that are a bit stronger than normal plastic injection molded parts.

Before that point we’d like to focus on durability, using the bikes for as long as possible, passing it on to other riders or the next generation.</p><p>If during this time something happens, then in many cases the carbon can be repaired. Our partners in Switzerland have a carbon repair shop, so many small frame damages can be easily repaired. And if for some reason one of our riders cannot use his or her bike anymore, then we have a buyback program. If the bike is relatively young and undamaged, then we buy the bike back and see if we can find a new rider for the bike.</p><p>Finally, we also like to help with recycling. We are in contact with a carbon recycling factory. So, if one of our riders had a crash and damaged the frame beyond repair, the frame can be sent to us and we will recycle it. We pay for the transport costs and our riders will get a nice Instinctiv jersey in return.</p><p>We are looking forward to doing more and using recycled material again in our future bikes. We believe that the weight to stiffness ratio of the recycled material will get better and better over time, which means we can use more and more recycled material in our frames.</p><p><em>Got&nbsp;a question of your own?
