It's my hope that every young person who feels alone or unsupported can find connection and community at this incredible organization.\"</p></blockquote><p>The expanded program will provide support both at the new community houses and to those who are receiving help online during the pandemic. Apple's technology donations will allow Encircle to better reach LGBTQ+ youth where they're located, even when meeting in person is not possible.</p><p>Encircle has served more than 70,000 individuals and funded thousands of family and youth therapy sessions to support those facing suicidality, and isolation and depression.
