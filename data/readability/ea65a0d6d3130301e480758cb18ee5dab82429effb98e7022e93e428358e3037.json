Dropping almost 20% off the price of each wheelset, the new hubs are said to better transfer pedal &amp; disc brake forces for bombproof reliability on or off-road.</p><h2>FFWD Two/One hubs make

many spokes on the disc side up front to transfer its higher braking forces to the rim. Add in a larger hubshell with bigger &amp; better-sealed bearings (compared to DT 350s), and the result is much stiffer, more responsive wheels with still relatively low spoke counts.</p><p><a
