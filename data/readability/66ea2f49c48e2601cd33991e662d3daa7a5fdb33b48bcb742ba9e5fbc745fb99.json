Now, Apple's patent for oxide coatings has again stressed the advantages of using titanium on consumer electronics, such as \"high strength, stiffness, and hardness.\"</p><blockquote><p>For example, the relatively high hardness of titanium makes it resistant to scratches, and its stiffness makes it durable enough to withstand bending. In addition, titanium is inherently more corrosion-resistant than certain other alloys.</p></blockquote><p>Apple highlights that, compared to other metals, titanium easily shows fingerprints when handled. This is partially due to the relatively low reflectivity of titanium and titanium alloy surfaces.</p><blockquote><p>One of the disadvantages of using titanium and its alloys, however, is that oil from fingerprints can be readily seen on bare titanium and titanium alloy surfaces, leaving unattractive marks on consumer electronics. The nature and volume of the fingerprints can be factors, but even clean fingers can leave a relatively dramatic mark on titanium surfaces.</p></blockquote><p><img alt=\"visible fingerprint patent example\" width=\"1860\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/H3LZSG72HEJq_s6cczPDszVAukw=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/H3LZSG72HEJq_s6cczPDszVAukw=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/H3LZSG72HEJq_s6cczPDszVAukw=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/lorAGLryTdFD3Ibr5WXA28-q648=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/niQWv7ID6Zn-jILbELA-NxOc5XE=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ZqS2xNTESWzUKtPKOrNt4C-IjW0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/H3LZSG72HEJq_s6cczPDszVAukw=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/lorAGLryTdFD3Ibr5WXA28-q648=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/niQWv7ID6Zn-jILbELA-NxOc5XE=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/ZqS2xNTESWzUKtPKOrNt4C-IjW0=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/visible-fingerprint-patent-example.jpg 2500w\"></p><p>Conventional oleophobic coatings are usually used to reduce fingerprinting on glass surfaces such as the front and back of iPhones, but these types of coatings are much less effective on titanium surfaces.
