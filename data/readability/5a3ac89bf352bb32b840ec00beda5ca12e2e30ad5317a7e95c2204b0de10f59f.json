when purchasing an ‌iPhone‌ from Apple, with the company highlighting up to $700 in savings from AT&amp;T, up to $320 in savings from T-Mobile/Sprint, and up to $440 in savings from Verizon, with all of these deals related to trade-in bonuses.</p><p>Apple's carrier deal site breaks down the bonuses that are available from each carrier for each <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> model, and it provides links to the ‌iPhone‌ purchase pages and options to chat with an ‌iPhone‌ specialist for more info.</p><p>Apple relies on carrier deals and trade-in offers to make ‌iPhone‌ pricing more attractive for consumers, so it makes sense for the company to put more emphasis on the price drops that customers can get when using a carrier trade-in option. Apple also has its own trade-in deals that are available separately.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">Leaker Suggests Apple Event to Be Held on March 23</a></h3><p>Monday March 8, 2021 2:25 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/sami-fathi/\" rel=\"author\">Sami Fathi</a></p><p>Apple will hold its first event of the year on March 23, according to information provided by a reputable Chinese leaker (via DuanRui).
