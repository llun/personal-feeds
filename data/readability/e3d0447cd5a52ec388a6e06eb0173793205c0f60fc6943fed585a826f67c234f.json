water-resistant to 50 meters, but Gurman suggests that Apple could make a new device more \"rugged\" by giving it a rubberized casing, making it more resistant to damage in extreme environments

noting that his sources say it could be ultimately canceled or delayed.</p><p>Apple is also working on new swim tracking features for the Apple Watch, according to the report, although no additional
