That usually costs an extra $250, but today Expercom (via Amazon) is selling the 512GB MacBook Air for $1,170, good for $79 off and the best price we’ve seen for this configuration.</p><p>The M1 MacBook Air looks the same as the Intel version it replaced last November, but inside it’s a completely new machine. It’s one of the first machines to feature Apple silicon. Speeds are massively improved over its predecessor and are basically as fast as the 13-inch MacBook Pro for regular work. It has a completely silent fanless design along with an excellent keyboard, great display, and a pair of Thunderbolt ports. And it’s got amazingly good battery life to go along with it.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3596603/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">our 4.5-star review</a>, we called the M1 MacBook Air “an absolutely stunning debut for Apple silicon” and “a truly incredible feat” of performance. So unless you want to spend way more on a MacBook Pro, this is the one to buy.</p></div><p><em>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
