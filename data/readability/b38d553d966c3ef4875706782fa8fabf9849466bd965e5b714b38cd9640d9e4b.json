This year, Samsung rolled out a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/galaxy-s21-ultra-200-cheaper-but-still-not-competitive/\">$200 price drop</a> across the lineup, resulting in an $800 base model, $1,000 Plus model, and $1,200 Ultra model.

Galaxy S21 sales have risen 1.5-to-2 times higher in Korea, making the S21 the most popular Samsung device since the Galaxy S8's release in 2017. <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-reveals-record-pre-order-performance-for-galaxy-s21-5g-series-in-the-uk\">Samsung UK</a> has touted strong sales, too.</p><p>Back in the US, Strategy Analytics notes we still have a strong appetite for super-expensive phones, with the $1,200 Galaxy S21 Ultra making up 40 percent of Samsung sales.</p><p>These sales numbers only cover the first month, but it's a good sign for Samsung's flagship.
