Sagan entered the stage with a 22-point lead over Davide Cimolai (Israel Start-Up Nation) and a 25-point lead over Fernando Gaviria (UAE-Team Emirates) in the points classification, making the intermediate sprint and the stage itself potentially crucial in the battle for maglia ciclamino.</p><p>The break that did eventually escape did not feature any major threats to Sagan’s hold on the points jersey, and as it began to pull away, Sagan and his teammate Daniel Oss slowed the pace at the front.</p><p>After the stage, Sagan acknowledged the importance of the day but did not address the fine.</p><p>“Today was an important stage and the key was not to lose points for the ciclamino jersey,” he said. “We kept under control the sprinters that were close in the points classification and held on to the ciclamino. On Friday and Saturday, we have two hard mountain stages.”</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"aaf22f664061a49ef4508de481e98911d634694064e52530c7ea6714b3e61737","category":"Cycling"}
