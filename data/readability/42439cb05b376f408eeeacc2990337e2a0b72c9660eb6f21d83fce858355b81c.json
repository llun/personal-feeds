Although the decision has yet to be confirmed, industry insiders report that LG is now likely to shut down its smartphone business instead of selling it. A source speaking to the <em>Korea Herald</em> explained:</p><blockquote><p>LG reportedly had talks with others over the sale of the unit but apparently there was not much progress in their negotiations. It seems that selling its entire mobile business appears to be difficult at this moment, as is the partial sale of the unit.</p></blockquote><p>With LG's internal restructuring plan now reaching its conclusion and no buyer having been found, the company is said to be leaning toward cutting its losses closing the smartphone division fully.</p><p>LG's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/12/lg-teases-first-rollable-smartphone-ces/\">recently announced</a> smartphone projects, such \"Rainbow\" and \"Rollable,\" are believed to have been scrapped, as the company looks to utilize its existing mobile workforce elsewhere in the business, such as the vehicle component solutions division.</p><p>LG is expected to publicize the decision about its smartphone business unit next month after a board meeting.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/handy-iphone-shortcuts/\">Handy iPhone and iPad Shortcuts You Should Check Out</a></h3><p>Friday March 19, 2021 12:31 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>With the launch of iOS 13, Apple introduced Shortcuts support and the Shortcuts app, adding a whole range of new functionality to the iPhone.
