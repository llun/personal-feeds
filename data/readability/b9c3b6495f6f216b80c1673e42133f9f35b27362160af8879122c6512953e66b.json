Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri later <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1372691059348631555?s=20\">confirmed in a tweet</a> that a version of the popular photo sharing app is \"something we're exploring.\"</p><p>\"Kids are increasingly asking their parents if they can join apps that help them keep up with their friends,\" wrote Mosseri. \"A version of Instagram where parents have control, like we did [with] Messenger Kids, is something we're exploring.

Following the launch, several children's health advocates called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to discontinue the product, <a href=\"https://commercialfreechildhood.org/wp-content/uploads/archive/devel-generate/gaw/FBMessengerKids.pdf\">citing research</a> that \"excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to children and teens, making it very likely this new app will undermine children's healthy development.\"</p><p>Facebook said it had consulted multiple of experts during the app's development, although a <em>Wired</em> report later <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-funds-its-favorite-experts-but-skirts-tough-critics/\">revealed</a> that the company had financial relationships with many of the people and organizations that advised on the product.</p><p>In 2019, <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20706250/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-chat-app-unauthorized-adults\">The Verge</a></em> reported on a bug in Messenger Kids that allowed children to join groups with strangers.
