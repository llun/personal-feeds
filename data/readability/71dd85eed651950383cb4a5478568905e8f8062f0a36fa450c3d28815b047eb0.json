The Melbourne-based maker was one of the standouts at the first Handmade Bicycle Show Australia, and then a few weeks later walked away with the best-in-show award in his debut at the Bristol Bike Show. He hasn’t slowed since. </p><p>Hester’s since quickly progressed from fillet-brazed steel bikes to TIG-welded titanium. Many of his creations include custom 3D-printed titanium pieces and some even showcase his engineering expertise in composites. </p><p>In the above video, Hester talks about the most traditional bike he makes, a steel rim brake road bike named the Razzo.
