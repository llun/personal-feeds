This comes after well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the third-generation AirPods <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">will enter mass production in the second half of 2021</a>, meaning a launch could be months away.</p><p>At this point, it's unclear if Apple will even be holding its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">rumored March 23 event</a>, as it was generally expected that Apple would have announced the event by today at around 9 a.m. Pacific Time. Of course, Apple could choose to announce the event at a different time, or it could introduce new products with press releases as it did last March.</p><p>Apple has a handful of products rumored to be in the pipeline, including its long-awaited AirTags item trackers, a new iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display, new iPad and iPad mini models, and a new Apple TV. A redesigned iMac with Apple silicon is also expected to launch this year, but it's unclear if the computer is ready yet. 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon are not expected until the second half of 2021.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad/\">Apple Shares 'Jump' AirPods Pro Ad</a></h3><p>Sunday March 14, 2021 9:09 pm PDT by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/\" rel=\"author\">Juli Clover</a></p><p>Apple today shared a new AirPods Pro-focused ad called \"Jump\" on its YouTube channel, highlighting the Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency features of the earbuds in a creative way.
