We're honored that Nintendo has chosen Niantic to be its publisher of real-world AR applications.</p><p>To kick off the partnership, Niantic and Nintendo are developing an app based on the Pikmin franchise. The app will include gameplay activities to encourage walking and make walking more delightful. Slated to launch later this year, this will be the first title created by our Tokyo Studio since it was established in April 2018.</p></blockquote><p>Niantic is allowing people <a href=\"https://nianticlabs.com/newappsignup/\">to sign up</a> to get more information about the title, and says more details will be available in the coming months.</p><p>In a statement, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto said that Niantic's AR tech will make it possible to experience the world as if we're living with Pikmin all around us.</p><blockquote><p>Niantic's AR technology has made it possible for us to experience the world as if Pikmin are secretly living all around us. Based on the theme of making walking fun, our mission is to provide people a new experience that's different from traditional games. We hope that the Pikmin and this app will become a partner in your life.</p></blockquote><p>Niantic developed hit game \"Pokémon Go,\" an augmented reality title where players are tasked with catching Pokémon while out and about.
