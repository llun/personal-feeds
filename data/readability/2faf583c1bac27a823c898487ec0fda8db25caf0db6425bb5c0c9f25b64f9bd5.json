Following a marketing stunt in which three different stars of the movie shared three fake movie names alongside initial images from the film on Instagram, the actual title for the new Spider-Man movie has been revealed in a cheeky <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpiderMan/status/1364632720270221317?s=20\">Twitter video</a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/spider-man/\"> and </a><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/spider-man-no-way-home-tom-holland-title-reveal\">blog post</a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/spider-man/\">:&nbsp;<em>Spider Man: No Way Home</em>.</a></p><p>The fake names that had circulated previously included&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Phone Home</em>,&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man: Home Slice</em>.</p><p><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> will premiere on December 17, 2021.</p><p>And speaking of release dates and Marvel characters, the Disney+ series <em>Loki</em> <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/marvel-studios-loki-premiere-disney-plus-june-11\">premieres</a> June 11. The series had been previously announced, but this is the first time we know the exact day to expect the first episode.</p><p>Here's Marvel Studios' description of the series:</p><blockquote><p><em>Loki</em> features the God of Mischief as he steps out of his brother’s shadow in a new series that takes place after the events of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>.&nbsp;Tom Hiddleston returns as the title character, joined by Owen Wilson, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Sophia Di Martino, Wunmi Mosaku and Richard E. Grant. Kate Herron directs <em>Loki</em>,&nbsp;and Michael Waldron is head writer.</p></blockquote><p>But Disney's plethora of announcements today is not limited to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/marvel/\">Marvel</a>. The new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/star-wars/\"><em>Star Wars</em></a> animated series&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-bad-batch-premiere-date\"><em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em></a> will hit Disney+ on that marketer-and-fan-conceived <em>Star Wars</em> holiday May the 4th.</p><p>The first episode will premiere that day, while the second will hit shortly after on May 7. From then on, new episodes will go live each Friday.</p><p>The series is produced by Dave Filoni, Athena Portillo, Bead Rau, Jennifer Corbett, Carrie Beck, and Josh Rimes—all of whom worked on one prior animated series or another, such as <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> or&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Resistance</em>. Filoni also directed multiple episodes of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/mandalorian-season-2-premiere-this-is-still-the-way/\">The Mandalorian</a></em>.</p><p>Here's Disney's synopsis:</p><blockquote><p>The series follows the elite and experimental troopers of Clone Force 99 (first introduced in <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>) as they find their way in a rapidly changing galaxy in the immediate aftermath of the Clone War.&nbsp;Members of Bad Batch, as they prefer to be called—a unique squad of clones who vary genetically from their brothers in the Clone Army—each possess a singular exceptional skill, which makes them extraordinarily effective soldiers and a formidable crew.</p></blockquote><p>Disney+ still has more <em>Star Wars</em> and Marvel content coming, including&nbsp;<em>The Book of Boba Fett</em>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Andor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Ashoka</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hawkeye</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ms. Marvel</em>,&nbsp;<em>What If?</em>,&nbsp;<em>Moon Knight</em>,&nbsp;<em>She-Hulk</em>,&nbsp;<em>Secret Invasion</em>, <em>Ironheart</em>,&nbsp;<em>Armor Wars</em>, and&nbsp;<em>I Am Groot</em>.</p><p><em>Listing image by <a href=\"https://www.disney.com/\">Disney</a></em></p></div></div>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2faf583c1bac27a823c898487ec0fda8db25caf0db6425bb5c0c9f25b64f9bd5","category":"Tech"}
