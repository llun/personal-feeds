No, that’s not some kind of secret message from Wolf Tooth Components – unless you’re looking for a water bottle cage with multiple positions, that is. The cages were first launched as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/08/14/king-cage-wolf-tooth-join-up-for-adjustable-stainless-ti-bottle-cages/\">a partnership with King Cage back in 2018</a>. The cages turned out to be very popular. So popular, that Wolf Tooth Components says that they had trouble keeping them in stock. Now, the cages are back – with a new twist on their manufacturing.</p><h2>Still Made in the USA</h2><p><a

produce more cages rapidly, Wolf Tooth has now brought their production completely in-house. Previously, the base plates with their adjustable ‘Morse code” bolt pattern were made by WTC, then shipped to King Cage where they were welded up into the finish product, and then shipped back. Now, everything is done under one roof in Minnesota which still offers a super light, made-in-the-USA bottle cage. Just without help from King Cage.</p><h2><span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-large-leaderboard-2\"></span>What’s Different?</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Ti Morse bottle cages\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18151232/WTC-Wolf-Tooth-Components-Ti-tianium-morse-water-bottle-cage-made-in-house-USA-weight-4-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Compared to the previous WTC x King Cage version (above, left), the new Ti Morse cages (above, right) are very similar.

You’ll still find up to 32mm of vertical adjustment thanks to the four cage positions using one round hole and one oval hole per mount. That allows you to position cages depending on the frame fit which is especially beneficial for smaller frames where bottle spacing is at a premium.<span
