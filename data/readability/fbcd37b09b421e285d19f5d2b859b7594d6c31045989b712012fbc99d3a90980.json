I started studying because I felt like I needed a bit more in my life. I tried to do a few things but I missed that competitive edge and competition,' Cummings stated in a press conference.</p><p>'I’ve always kept in touch with Dave [Brailsford] and we spoke for a while about various things, and eventually, he offered me an opportunity to be a part of the team. A lot of the studying I’ve done is around leadership and anywhere you go, Dave is used as an example. I guess he’s kind of like a role model to me.</p><p>'I’ve always been interested in that side of the sport, the leadership and team culture, and to be joining now when Dave is adding an extra dimension to what the team already does so well is so exciting.'</p><p>Cummings went on to state that conversations with the team started with former team CEO Fran Millar last year before her departure. He then carried on to say that these talks resumed with Brailsford and the team boss was keen to have Cummings help navigate Ineos's new aggressive approach to racing.</p><p>'This team has been so incredibly successful in what they’ve done, and that isn’t being changed, it’s just being tweaked and an extra dimension added, which hopefully will bring more success,' added Cummings.</p><p>'Riders will see that everyone will get an opportunity, but to earn that opportunity you need discipline and commitment.'</p><p>In the twilight of his 15-season career that saw him race 13 Grand Tours, Cummings became synonymous with aggressive riding, often winning stages at big races from breakaways, most notably, Stage 14 of the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"fbcd37b09b421e285d19f5d2b859b7594d6c31045989b712012fbc99d3a90980","category":"Cycling"}
