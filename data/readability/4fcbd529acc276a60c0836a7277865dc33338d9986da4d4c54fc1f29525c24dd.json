It is actually supposed to be winter here in Iceland but the south part of the country feels more like spring. It ended up being a gravel ride so my suspension was a bit of an overkill.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
