You’ll get the ability to unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch, AirPlay support for Fitness+, and the long-awaited App Tracking Transparency feature.</p><p>Apple released the first developer beta on February 1, but the public beta did not follow immediately after as it often does, instead coming on February 4 after a second build for developers.

Simply put, your iPhone will now require applications to ask for permission (through a standard iOS prompt) whenever they want to track your activities&nbsp;<em>outside</em> the app, such as across other apps or websites. Most users are unaware that many apps even do this. Apple is not blocking the practice, merely requiring informed consent just as it does for, say, location access.</p><div><p><img onclick=\"jwplayer('bottomRightPlayer').remove(); this.style.display = 'none';\" id=\"jw-standalone-close-button\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"></p></div><p>You won’t immediately see these prompts upon installing the iOS 14.5 beta. Rather, the requirement will go into effect later this spring.</p><h3>Crash reporting and speed traps in Apple Maps</h3><p>Long a feature of Google Maps and Waze, Apple Maps users in iOS 14.5 will be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/ios-14-5-apple-maps-crowdsourcing-accidents/\" rel=\"nofollow\">share crash reports, road hazards, and speed traps</a> in real-time to help navigate around traffic. It's unclear how the system will work, but presumably, Apple will collect all of the data and offer alternative routes when things get backed up.</p><h3>AirPlay 2 support for Fitness+</h3><p>One of the biggest setbacks of Apple’s new fitness subscription service is that you can only use it on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. You can’t use it on a Mac or any other smart TV. With iOS 14.5, you can stream workouts from your iPhone or iPad to an AirPlay 2 supported device, which is a&nbsp;<em>huge</em> improvement. There are lots of TVs that support AirPlay 2 these days, so this makes the service a lot less restrictive. You won’t see your real-time metrics on screen, but that’s a relatively small price to pay.</p><h3>Unlock iPhone with Apple Watch</h3><p>Face ID is great, but the constant mask-wearing of the COVID-19 global pandemic has exposed an obvious flaw—it doesn’t work when half your face is covered up. With iOS 14.5 (and&nbsp;watchOS 7.4), you have the option to make your iPhone work like your Mac does, and automatically unlock when you’re wearing an unlocked Apple Watch.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by Macworld's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_bd95b2703fb293514faf05a63028d9c9\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01eydr8r115bpzyxgccf53tk03\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/unlock-watch-settings-100875686-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>unlock watch settings\"><img alt=\"unlock watch settings\" width=\"1200\" height=\"495\" data-imageid=\"100875686\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/unlock-watch-settings-100875686-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/unlock-watch-settings-100875686-large.jpg\"></a><small>IDG</small></figure><p>To use this feature, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Face ID &amp; Passcode</em> and enable the Unlock with Apple Watch toggle. You’ll have to be wearing your Apple Watch which must be unlocked and protected with a passcode. Then, when Face ID sees you’re wearing a mask, it will unlock with your Apple Watch. You’ll feel a quick double-tap on the watch haptics and see a message on your iPhone screen that says “Unlocking with Apple Watch.” It all happens quickly and seamlessly. Where was this feature in the summer of 2020?</p><h3>5G Global dual-sim support</h3><p>If you have an iPhone 12 and make use of dual-sim mode, both connections will be limited to 4G LTE (except in mainland China, where the SIM used for data will support 5G). In iOS 14.5, 5G is now supported on the data connection when you use dual-SIM mode.</p><h3>Podcast and News app design tweaks</h3><p>The Podcast and Apple News apps have had a few small but welcome tweaks to their design.</p><h3>”Hey Siri, Call Emergency”</h3><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_8c8bfd7f8b868a13479dc3e69d1f0841\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01eydr8r115bpzyxgccf53tk03\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/siri-emergency-100875799-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>siri emergency\"><img alt=\"siri emergency\" width=\"1200\" height=\"936\" data-imageid=\"100875799\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/siri-emergency-100875799-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/siri-emergency-100875799-large.jpg\"></a><small>IDG</small></figure><p>A new Siri capability allows you to request Siri call emergency services. You’ll get a big three-second countdown on the screen to cancel the request, after which Siri will call your local emergency services number (e.g. 911 in the United States) on speakerphone.</p><h3>Updated game controller support</h3><p>You can finally sync your Xbox Series X/S or PlayStation 5 game controller to your iPhone or iPad.</p><h3>Sorting and printing Reminders</h3><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/ios-14-5-reminders-sort-100875802-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>IDG</div>ios 14 5 reminders sort\"><img alt=\"ios 14 5 reminders sort\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" data-imageid=\"100875802\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/ios-14-5-reminders-sort-100875802-medium.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/02/ios-14-5-reminders-sort-100875802-medium.jpg\"></a><small>IDG</small></figure><p>Reminders lists can&nbsp;<em>finally</em> be sorted with a variety of criteria: Manual (the default), Due Date, Creation Date, Priority, or Title. You can print Reminders lists now, too.</p><p>These features seem like they should have been there years ago.</p><h3>iPad: Horizontal boot and emoji search</h3><p>The iPad has a couple features exclusive to it. There’s now a horizontal Apple logo when you reboot your iPad in horizontal orientation. More importantly, emoji search (which came to the iPhone in the initial iOS 14 release) is now available on iPad as well.</p><h3>Hints of new Wallet or Apple Card features</h3><p>The sleuths at 9to5Mac have found some hints in the code of iOS 14.5 that suggest a couple new features that may come to when this update is made public, or perhaps a later release. The first is the ability to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-code-reveals-upcoming-apple-card-family-feature-for-multi-user-accounts/\" rel=\"nofollow\">share your Apple Card with family members</a>. It’s pretty easy to get multiple credit cards for your family, but the Apple Card has been intrinsically locked to one person. This feature would allow multiple users to use one Apple Card account, with some standard card-sharing features like spending limits.</p><p>Not necessarily locked to the Apple Card is the <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-financial-health-feature/\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovery of a new “FinHealth” framework</a>. It’s unclear what this is yet, but it could use machine learning to perform entirely on-device analysis of your spending (in the Wallet app) and make suggestions to improve your financial health.</p><h2 id=\"toc-2\">How to get the iOS 14.5 beta</h2><p>If you’re feeling brave, you can try out iOS 14.5 before its general release. Apple suggests you do not run the 14.5 beta on any critical device, and that’s good advice—you never know what can go wrong.</p><p>Developers can go head to <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/download/\" rel=\"nofollow\">developer.apple.com/download</a> on the device upon which they which to run the beta, and download a developer beta profile. Those who aren’t developers can join the public beta by heading to <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta.apple.com</a> using the device upon which you wish to run the beta, signing in, and downloading the beta profile.</p><p>Once you have the profile you must enable it by going to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Profile</em>. Your device will reset to enable the profile. After it has reset with the profile enabled, you can head to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Updates</em> to download the latest beta release.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
