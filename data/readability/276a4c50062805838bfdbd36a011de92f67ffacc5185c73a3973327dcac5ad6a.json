With huge volume tires and totally reshaped geometry built for flat, high-speed cornering, the SpeedWay Kartodrome debuted with a win and a podium at the Italian Fixed Gear National Championships last weekend, and could be coming to your indoor asphalt racing scene or even city streets soon…</p><h2>TRed SpeedWay Kartodrome flat track cart racing fixed gear</h2><p><a

They then adapted that light, stiff fixed gear racer into a crit race bike adding gears for the special edition <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/09/27/eb17-3-new-bikes-3-metals-from-tred-for-road-racing-adventure-trail/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manaia Nera FA</a>. And more recently, TRed even took it to another wild extreme in their modern aero alloy<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/08/20/tred-horkokhan-slips-in-modern-aero-alloy-stayer-bike-for-motor-paced-track-racing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;Horkokhan</a> stayer bike for motor-paced track racing.</p><p>But none of those were really suited to modern urban fixie racing on a flat karting track at superhigh speeds with incredibly tight turns. And taking inspiration from the Rad Race format we’ve seen in Berlin over the past five years or so (often dominated by Italian racers, as I recall) that’s just what this year’s Italian Fixed Gear National Championships had in store…</p><p><a

fixed gear bike for their Factory Racing team riders.</p><p>In fact, it seems that the men’s prototype bikes had been stolen a few weeks earlier, so only Francesca Selva had a chance to train a bit

large-volume René Herse 38mm front &amp; 44mm rear tires with the goal of getting as much rubber on the road as possible for the tight &lt;10m radius turns (much larger than the 28mm slicks many competitors raced.) The idea being that the larger lateral tire footprint would allow for much greater lean angles and faster cornering.</p><p>To make that fit (and even a tire up to 50mm wide up front), the bikes get a wide &amp; relatively long 397mm axle-to-crown carbon fork. A 12mm thru-axle provides stiffness, and 43-50mm adjustable rake via an eccentric at the dropout allows adjustment of the bike’s handling, tailored to a specific track or riding style.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear.jpg\" alt=\"TRed SpeedWay Kartodrome flat track cart racing fixed gear bike, urban fixie racing,&nbsp;angled\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb19 src ng ngcb19 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22132816/TRed-SpeedWay-Kartodrome-flat-track-cart-racing-fixed-gear-bike_angled-rear-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a>Then, of course there is the small-diameter steel tubing and almost no perceptible bottom bracket drop.</p><p>To get the 10° greater lean angles than traditional fixie competitors which TRed says they saw in racing, the bike needed a much higher bottom bracket since fixed gear riders can’t freewheel through the turns. So the bottom bracket was raised by a full 4cm vs. a regular track bike resulting in a very minimal 25mm drop. Likely not a bike for high-speed alpine descending, but nice and twitchy fast for karting.</p><p>Those small 30-35mm diameter butted chromoly steel tubes were also specifically chosen to give the bike a more springy, less stiff ride to lean into the tight turns and jump out of them without losing grip, rather than the harsher-ride of an alloy frame.</p><p><a

TRed, racing photos by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/geme_omar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Geme Omar De Lazzari</a></figcaption></figure><p>The core TRed SpeedWay Kartodrome will be a brakeless fixed gear race bike just like Selva raced to the championship win above. Then, a TRed SpeedWay UrbanFighter version will add in a front disc brake for more street riding versatility, plus the option to have a fixed or singlespeed freewheel rear wheel, or even the power-regenerating e-bike rear wheel tech we saw in their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/03/23/treds-wild-fixed-gear-regenerative-bestianera-hybrid-streetfighter-urban-e-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BestiaNera Hybrid</a> a few years back! Lastly, this autumn a SpeedWay DirtyFighter will be added too, likely with off-road tires suitable for gravel flat track racing or a bit of junkyard cross? Only time will tell on that one.</p><p>How much it will actually cost is still up in the air, but TRed says the price will be “nothing crazy” so we expect it somewhere closer to the ~2000€ alloy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/04/14/tred-aracnide-a02a-ool-ultra-premium-5-9kg-steel-road-bike-plus-scandium-manaia-track/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manaia track</a> frameset, rather than the more complete ~4000€ alloy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2019/08/20/tred-horkokhan-slips-in-modern-aero-alloy-stayer-bike-for-motor-paced-track-racing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Horkokhan stayer</a> frameset &amp; cockpit kit.</p><p><a href=\"http://tredbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>TRedbikes.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"276a4c50062805838bfdbd36a011de92f67ffacc5185c73a3973327dcac5ad6a","category":"Cycling"}
