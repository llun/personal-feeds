We all know what happened next.</p><p>With all competitions including the Olympics postponed or cancelled due to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/coronavirus\">Covid-19</a>, Lahbi found himself refocussing. 'I realised the most important part of competition is the one against myself,' he said.</p><p>He began cycling to maintain his fitness, with a turbo trainer helping him get through lockdown.</p><p>While most cyclists would consider climbing the Monte Grappa a challenge, the task Lahbi, a middle-distance runner, set himself was seen as impossible.&nbsp;At 1,775m high, the Monte Grappa is the highest peak of the Grappa Massif in the northeast of Italy.</p><p>There are 10 routes to cycle up the mountain, with the easiest averaging 6% over 27km, and there are gold, silver and bronze certificates awarded to those who climb 10, six or three of the ascents within a year.</p><p>Lahbi decided he would climb all 10 routes in one non-stop ride. That's 455km and 16,500m of elevation gain â€“ almost twice the height of Everest.</p><div id=\"file-43443\"><p><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/02/tornanti_cc-fulcrum-lahbi-grappa-20200731-090234-5465f.jpg\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" alt=\"\"></p></div><p>He was told frequently that he wouldn't manage it as not many people had even done more than five ascents in one go. One local cyclist told him he would ruin his body.</p><p>Well somehow Lahbi did it. Completing 41 hours of riding in the early hours of 1st August 2020.</p><p>'I think you have to keep challenging yourself to grow your boundaries and push them away. If there's something you think is impossible, you should try it,' says Lahbi.&nbsp;</p><p>'This is what competition is to me.'</p><h3>Watch: Jacopo Lahbi's conquering of the Monte Grappa</h3><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaI7oLXFjLo?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"6112815df340729f6aad2bc4c3f781b7297db71044ceeb1831091f7b252e686b","category":"Cycling"}
