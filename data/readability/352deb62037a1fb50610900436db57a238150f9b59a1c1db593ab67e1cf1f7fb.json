We have a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3392798/how-apple-tv-channels-prices-compare-to-native-apps-like-hbo-now-showtime-and-cbs-all-access.html\">comparison guide</a>.</p><h2 id=\"toc-5\">What if I already subscribe to one of these services?</h2><p>If you subscribe to any of these services, you won’t be able to use your current subscription&nbsp;<em>as a Channel</em> in the TV app. Most of the native apps integrate with the TV app, so you’ll see content in the Watch Now tab, and your shows and movies will appear in Up Next. But you’ll have to have the appropriate app installed, and will be automatically kicked over to it to play content. If you subscribe through an in-app purchase, you'll be billed by Apple, but if you sign up on the web you'll be billed by that content provider. In either case, you may or may not be able to make use of Family Sharing.</p><p>To get playback directly within the TV app, Family Sharing, and billing from Apple, you’ll need to cancel your existing subscription and re-subscribe through the TV app’s Channels section. You will then&nbsp;<em>need</em> to use the TV app to play back content.</p><h2 id=\"toc-6\">What about Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu?</h2><p>Netflix does not work with Apple on the TV app at all. Its content does not appear in the TV app in any way—you just have to install the Netflix app and use that.</p><p>Hulu is not a Channel—you can’t subscribe and watch directly within the TV app—but the service&nbsp;<em>does</em> support the TV app’s features. So Hulu content will appear in the TV app’s tabs and search, and its shows will populate the Up Next section. You’ll have to have the Hulu app installed in order to play shows or movies, though, and you have to subscribe through the Hulu app or site.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video works just like Hulu does: It's not a Channel, but if you install the app and have a subscription, all the content integrates within the TV app.</p><h2 id=\"toc-7\">Can I buy bundles of services?</h2><p>So far, Apple hasn’t mentioned any Channels bundles. It would make sense to offer such a thing as the library of Channels grows, but for the time being, they are all à la carte.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
