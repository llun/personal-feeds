Like all Gravel Kings 32 mm and above, the pink and blue tyres are tubeless-compatible. </p><p>“These limited edition tires have garnered a bit of a cult following in the bike scene, and it’s a fun challenge to come out with something different every year,” said Jeff Zell, Panaracer’s ‘Global Go-To Guy’. “For 2021, we choose Pansy, because it’s a really beautiful and rich color that’s also rather unique, and pink because it has been the number-one requested color by Panaracer fans for a while now.”</p><p>The Gravel King colours are available in 700×32 mm and 38 mm, with shipping expected to commence in early-mid June.
