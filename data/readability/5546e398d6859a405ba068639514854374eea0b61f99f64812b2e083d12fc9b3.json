That ‌iPhone‌ model had also been in a transparent case. While many of the reports have focused on the Red ‌iPhone‌ models, the fading has been seen less frequently on ‌iPhone 11‌ models in different colors.</p><p>Some <em>MacRumors</em> readers speculated that the color fading is due to UV exposure enabled by the clear case, but the problem would likely be more widespread if it was a UV exposure issue. There has also been speculation that the issue could be caused by a chemical reaction with a case, but there's no clear cut explanation.</p><p>There are a limited number of reports about color fading, but this is a problem that seems to have <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250202390\">persisted for years</a> as there are complaints about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/\">iPhone XR</a>, too. Aside from the ‌iPhone 12‌ photos shared by <em>Svetapple.sk</em>, we have not seen similar reports about color loss on other ‌iPhone 12‌ devices, and this could be a manufacturing defect that's not widespread.</p><p>Apple likely considers the color fading to be a cosmetic issue, so it's not known if devices that are suffering from color loss will be replaced.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">iPhone 13 Models Will 'Likely' Have Touch ID Under the Display</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models slated for release later this year will \"likely\" feature a fingerprint scanner embedded under the display for authentication, in addition to Face ID, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner and three of his colleagues.
