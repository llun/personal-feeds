That way, they’ll be safe (at least, safer) from the bike manufacturers’ PR/censorship department.<br>I hope you can upload your complete catalogue of past videos.</p><p>Unrelated: my MTB came with a 30mm aluminium spindle (SRAM dub) in a 41mm BB bore. The tiny bearings rarely survive more than 2,000km. The alignment in the frame seems pretty good; at least the cranks spins easily.<br>I’m not competent enough to do the math on the bearing life of those tiny ball bearings. I hope you may be able to show the math predicting the estimated life of those idioticly small bearings.</p><p>Keep up the good work you’re doing showing the lack of competence in the engineering department of bike OEMs, and how their marketing department lack any kind of integrity.</p><p>Sponge Bob, or Bob L’Eponge in France</p></div></div>","author":"admin","siteTitle":"Hambini Engineering","siteHash":"1914e5a1ff85f6709ba64c29f2993b45bb8ae4b7452977e0a1f13e2e79329648","entryHash":"208bbb559ee93e1c2db64f13ba1c48509e9775eda691eb675eb1692e771c24ac","category":"Cycling"}
