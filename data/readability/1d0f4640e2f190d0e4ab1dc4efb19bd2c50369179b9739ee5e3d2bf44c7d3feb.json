The company claims the hosts perpetuated lies and disinformation about Smartmatic’s role in the election, damaging its business and reputation.”</p><p>In reaction to the announcement, Media Matters president Angelo Carusone issued the following statement:</p></div><blockquote><div><p>Lou Dobbs reflected the full spectrum of Fox News’ deceit. He represented the very worst of cable news -- and he is the embodiment of Fox’s deceit and extremism.&nbsp;</p><p>Reports that they are firing Dobbs as Fox News faces increased pressure from Smartmatic’s 2.7b lawsuit is a sign the network is terrified and desperate to reassure advertisers and shareholders that things are not falling apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Dobbs is their scapegoat, but don’t be fooled.</p><p>This won’t change the content of Fox News. Every lie Lou Dobbs told will be continued to spread by other hosts on the network. Fox remains rife with deranged propagandists who will gladly fill his spot. The only effect of this decision is that it will elicit more backlash from the very audience that Fox News radicalized.</p><p>They’re flailing.</p></div></blockquote><div><p>You can find more of Media Matters' extensive coverage of Dobbs's program <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/lou-dobbs\">here</a>.</p></div></div></article></div></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1d0f4640e2f190d0e4ab1dc4efb19bd2c50369179b9739ee5e3d2bf44c7d3feb","category":"Tech"}
