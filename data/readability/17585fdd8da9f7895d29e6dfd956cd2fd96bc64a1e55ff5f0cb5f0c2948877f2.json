Facebook's upcoming watch is said to run a version of Google's Android software.</p><p>Facebook plans to sell the smart watch at close to its production cost, which is also what it does with the Oculus headset. There's no word on what pricing will be, but competing products range in price from $150 to $400+.</p><p>It's not likely a smart watch will go over well with those who have concerns about Facebook's data collection.
