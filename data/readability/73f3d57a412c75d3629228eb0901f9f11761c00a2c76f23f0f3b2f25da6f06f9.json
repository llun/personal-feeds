{"title":"Giro Donne: Lorena Wiebes continues sprinting dominance","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/giro-donne-lorena-wiebes-continues-sprinting-dominance/","date":1625850477000,"content":"<div><div><p>For the second time in the 2021 Giro Donne, Lorena Wiebes sprinted to victory. The DSM rider won stage 8 handily against Emma Norsgaard (Team Movistar) and Maria Vittoria Sperotto (A.R. Monex), a show of sprinting dominance that the Dutchwoman has perfected in 2021.</p><p>Norsgaard’s team was keen for stage 8 to end in a bunch sprint and spent the entire final 35 km lined up on the front, chasing down a break of three. Team DSM threw a few of their riders into the blue train, but once the race reached the closing kilometre the teams took to each side of the road.</p><p>Team DSM has been getting better and better at their readouts throughout the last two seasons, with Coryn Rivera and Wiebes working as the perfect sprinting duo.</p><p>Rivera his the wind with 200 metres to go as the road pitched slightly downhill. Around the final bend with 100 metres to go Rivera swung off, opening the door for her teammate, and the race was over.</p><p>Norsgaard, who has been cementing her name in the 2021 records as one of the best riders of the season, wasn’t even close to coming around the former Dutch national champion. A full bike length separated Wiebes from the young Danish rider. Another bike could have fit between Norsgaard and Sperotto.</p><p>It’s been quite the run for Wiebes this season, she has won 11 of the 38 race days she’s participated in. Ten of those 11 days were bunch sprints, one was the prologue at the Ceratizit Festival Elsy Jacobs.</p><hr><div><div><p>Giro d'Italia Internazionale Femminile (2.Pro) <span>San Vendemiano → Mortegliano</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ff/lorena-wiebes-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"73f3d57a412c75d3629228eb0901f9f11761c00a2c76f23f0f3b2f25da6f06f9","category":"Cycling"}
