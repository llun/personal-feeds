Some 30 riders were left in the pack with 20 km to go as riders took on the penultimate lap of the circuit, where <strong>Egan Bernal</strong> and <strong>Clément Champoussin</strong> got clear of the field on the Colla Micheri. A small group of chasers, including Mollema, caught them on the descent, however, and then Mollema fired off the front on the penultimate trip up the Capo Mele.</p><p>He took a little over 20 seconds into the last ascent of the Colla Micheri and still had a gap going over the top, with Bernal, Champoussin, <strong>Mauri Vansevenant</strong>, <strong>Mikel Landa</strong>, and <strong>Giulio Ciccone</strong> in the next group on the road. The chasing group was unable to close down the gap, which only grew as it became clear that there would be no catching Mollema. He soloed to victory with a 39-second advantage over Bernal, who nabbed runner-up honors ahead of Vansevenant.</p><p><strong>Top 10</strong></p><p>1 MOLLEMA Bauke (Trek – Segafredo) 4:57:05<br>2 BERNAL Egan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:39<br>3 VANSEVENANT Mauri (Deceuninck – Quick Step)<br>4 CHAMPOUSSIN Clément (AG2R Citroën Team)<br>5 CICCONE Giulio (Trek – Segafredo)<br>6 LANDA Mikel (Bahrain – Victorious)<br>7 KNOX James (Deceuninck – Quick Step) 0:57<br>8 VENDRAME Andrea (AG2R Citroën Team) 1:01<br>9 GHIRMAY HAILU Biniam (DELKO)<br>10 ROTA Lorenzo (Intermarché – Wanty – Gobert Matériaux)</p><h3>Bernal on back pain: ‘I know I will have to live with pain, at least for this year’</h3><p>Speaking of Egan Bernal, he has said that he is expecting to continue dealing with back pain this season, but that he is nonetheless hopeful for a return to some kind of form. Bernal abandoned last year’s Tour de France with back pain, later being diagnosed with scoliosis. After an offseason focused on rehabilitation, Bernal returned to racing in February and has already put up a few promising performances. He finished third overall at the Tour de la Provence, putting in a strong showing on Mont Ventoux, before his runner-up ride at the Trofeo Laigueglia on Wednesday.</p><p>“My objective for the Giro this year is to get back to being the Egan who likes to attack, the Egan who isn’t afraid of getting dropped,” Bernal said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/Giroditalia/03-03-2021/giro-d-italia-bernal-pantani-intervista-4001142175011_preview.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a>.</p><p>“On the Ventoux, my back didn’t cause me too much pain. Unfortunately, I know I will have to live with the pain, at least for this year. I just want to enjoy this race, which I have wanted to do for several years. And what happens, happens.”</p><h3>Crowdfunding effort aims to boost prize money for women’s Strade Bianche</h3><p>Amid conversations around the cycling world about the disparity in prize money for the men’s and women’s races at the <strong>Omloop Het Nieuwsblad</strong>, a crowdfunding campaign aims to bring the prize money for the women’s race at <strong>Strade Bianche</strong> closer to the amount paid out for the men’s race.</p><p>A GoFundMe titled “<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/equal-prize-money-for-the-womens-peloton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Equal prize money for the Women’s Peloton</a>” has raised over €7,000 towards its €10,000 goal as of publication time on Wednesday, with a plan of awarding that amount to the top five finishers at the Strade Bianche women’s race, which takes place on Saturday.</p><h3>MPCC questions decision to invite Vini Zabu to Giro d’Italia</h3><p>Following a meeting of its board of directors on March 1 and its general assembly on March 2, the <strong>MPCC</strong> published a press release on Wednesday that touched on a variety of subjects. Among them was the decision of <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> organizers to give the Vini Zabù team a wildcard invite to this year’s race. Last year, <strong>Vini Zabù</strong> rider <strong>Matteo Spreafico</strong> registered a doping positive during the race, leading to his expulsion from the Giro and his firing from the team.</p><p>In its statement on Wednesday, the MPCC questioned the decision to invite the squad after what happened last year.</p><p>“We reckon that this regrettable event should have influenced the decision of the organizer,” read the statement. “Given that this has not been the case, we have trouble understanding how RCS Sport sets its criteria, both in sporting and ethical terms.”</p><h3>Oberholzer, Gibbons win African Continental time trial titles</h3><p>South Africa’s Carla Oberholzer and Ryan Gibbons rode to time trial victories at the African Continental Championships on Wednesday in Cairo.</p><p>Oberholzer rode the 28 km course in 44:15 to win the women’s race with an advantage of 1:07 over fellow South African Frances Janse Van Rensburg. Vera Looser of Namibia rounded out the podium, 1:48 down.</p><p>Gibbons finished the 42 km course in 56:11 to take the men’s win. South Africa’s Kent Main was second, 1:41 down on Gibbons, with Rwanda’s Moise Mugisha in third, 3:16 back.</p><h3>Canyon owners asked to shelve their new Aeroad for now</h3><p>A day after the handlebar of <strong>Mathieu van der Poel’s Canyon Aeroad</strong> broke in the finale of Le Samyn, Canyon has issued a statement <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/canyon-asks-new-aeroad-owners-to-stop-riding-bike-following-broken-handlebar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">addressing the subject</a>. In the statement, the brand said that it is urgently investigating the matter, which affects cockpits CP0018 and CP0015, “only installed on the current Aeroad models CF SLX and CFR.” Canyon is asking affected customers to “stop using their bikes for the time being.”</p><p>The brand also said that its pro team partners “will switch to alternative bikes with immediate effect,” with pros changing over to the previous Aeroad model or the current Ultimate.</p><p>“Mathieu fortunately did not fall,” said Canyon founder Roman Arnold. “We want to ensure with absolute certainty that no one comes to harm before we have fully understood the root cause.”</p><h2>In case you missed it…</h2><ul><li>In his <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/specialized-power-mirror-saddle-long-term-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">latest video</a>, Dave Everett reviews the <strong>Specialized Power Mirror</strong> saddle.</li><li>Dave Rome explains why <strong>older road bikes</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/opinion-why-progress-is-so-slow-for-road-bike-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remain relevant</a> today.</li><li>This week’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/win-it-weekly-3t-exploro-pro-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Win It Weekly</a> prize is a <strong>3T Exploro Team</strong> frame.</li></ul><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e5b4836c983679f55e9c2eaa5a93f8a9f669a0e9afe20be012e34c99b1c47b13","category":"Cycling"}
