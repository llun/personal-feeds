{"title":"Poc Omne Eternal: the world's first helmet with solar-charged integrated light","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9248/poc-omne-eternal-the-worlds-first-helmet-with-solar-charged-integrated-light","date":1613482159000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>The new Poc Omne Eternal helmet is a claimed world-first. The Swedish brand believes this to be the first cycling helmet to introduce an integrated rear light that also manages to self-charge on the fly.</p><p>Integrating lights into helmets has been an innovative idea that manufacturers have been exploring for quite some time. It makes sense as a concept, a further point of reference to assist other road users in making sure you are seen. Brands such as Lumos, as an example, have introduced complex rear light systems into helmets such as the Kickstart and Ultra.</p><p>But none have managed to introduce a light system that can charge itself while you ride, until now.</p><p>Poc has utilised a new material called Powerfoyle, an iridescent nano-material developed by technology experts Exeger, that harvests both natural and artificial light, converting it into energy that continuously charges the small rear light on the rear of the helmet, meaning you will never need to remotely charge again.</p><p>This is sustainable technology that Poc CEO Jones Sjorgen believes is a simple solution to a big problem.</p><p>‘Safety and innovation are at the very centre of Poc’s approach. We can all see the very positive shift towards cycling for transport, health and recreation, but with that change comes the well-documented safety worries and risks that cyclists feel when sharing the road,’ said Sjorgen.</p><p>‘The Omne Eternal may be a world’s first, featuring groundbreaking solar cell technology, but our focus has been to provide riders with enhanced safety and a seamless user experience. Simply placing the helmet on the head will automatically activate the technology, enhancing safety without ever needing to think about it. And it supports all our efforts towards a more sustainable environment.’</p><p>For the best self-charging conditions, Powerfoyle still works best in natural sunlight but can obtain a ‘good charge’ from artificial light such as a light bulb.</p><p>The small light is not reliant on an on/off switch controlled by the rider, either. Instead, the light will continuously run on when it has been exposed to sufficient light, in both night and day conditions.</p><div id=\"file-43337\"><p><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/02/omne_eternal_1002_uraniumblack_0003.png?itok=P_021Uts\" alt=\"\"></p></div><p>Furthermore, no helmet with integrated lights has yet to really crack it style-wise, but this is aesthetically the best attempt at integrating a rear light into a helmet so far. The Poc Omne was already a well-designed, neat looking helmet that straddled the line between performance road and stylish commuting. The light has done nothing to detract from that.</p><p>Also, it is worth noting that Poc has retained its SPIN (Shearing Pad Inside) silicone technology which it claims can reduce the risk of head injury in the result of a collision.</p><p>While no product weights were provided, the pre-existing Poc Omen helmet currently comes in at 305g for a medium so we expect a similar weight, give or take by a further 20g for the new Omne Eternal.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pocsports.com/\">The new Poc Omne Eternal will cost €250</a>, come in small (50-56cm), medium (54-59cm) and large (59cm-61cm) and be available to purchase from June.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"a32c55bd94d7b70012ade64716f3126d8e22605b273e1d95c4438d95f1bd729f","category":"Cycling"}
