At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience. Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don't have any further news to share at this time.\"</p></blockquote><p>Spotify's live lyrics feature won't show up for all Spotify users as the company is using A/B testing to determine demand for live lyrics in the U.S. If you have Spotify, you can check to see if live lyrics are enabled by choosing a song and then checking for the lyrics option in the playback controls.</p><p>Spotify's live lyrics option is <a href=\"https://blog.musixmatch.com/spotify-and-musixmatch-powering-lyrics-together-5b7e02531495?gi=6ef2fceec4ae\">powered by Musixmatch</a> and has previously been launched in 26 markets around the world, including Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, Thailand, and India.</p><p>It's not yet clear if the live lyrics feature will fully launch in the U.S. because as <em>Engadget</em> points out, Spotify has tested it in markets like Canada and has then not followed through with the feature's release.</p><p>Major Spotify competitor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> has a built-in live lyrics option that has been available since iOS 13. The lyrics in ‌Apple Music‌ scroll as a song plays, keeping time with the music, which is similar to how Spotify's live lyrics work.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/macbook-pro-copy-iphone-design/\">New MacBook Pro Expected to Copy Familiar iPhone Design</a></h3><p>Apple's upcoming 2021 MacBook Pro is expected to take design cues from the iPhone 12, according to well-respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
