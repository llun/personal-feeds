When the service launched, Disney said that it hoped to hit 60 to 90 million subscribers by 2024, which it hit before the end of 2020.</p><p>Disney now believes that it will have 230 to 260 million subscribers worldwide by 2024, which will see Disney+ surpassing Netflix. In January, Netflix had more than <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-q4-2020-earnings-200-million-subscribers-1234887784/\">200 million subscribers</a> worldwide.</p><p>While Disney+ launched at the same time as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, Disney's streaming service has grown much more rapidly. By five months after launch, Disney+ already had over 50 million subscribers thanks to Disney's wealth of existing content and original shows like \"The Mandalorian\" and \"WandaVision.\"</p><p>Apple has not provided details on ‌Apple TV+‌ subscribers so there's no direct comparison available, but Apple's subscriber numbers are not likely to be anywhere near Disney's as Apple still has many people who are on free trials, which have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-extends-free-apple-tv-plus-trials/\">extended multiple times</a>. Apple is also reimbursing ‌Apple TV+‌ costs for subscribers at the current time and will do so until July.</p><p>Apple has been ramping up its selection of original movies and TV shows and has invested heavily in new content, but it will be years before ‌Apple TV+‌ has a catalog that can compete with other streaming services.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/apple-watch-series-7-breakthrough-health-feature/\">Apple Watch Series 7 to Gain Breakthrough New Health Feature</a></h3><p>Apple is reportedly planning to bring a new, first-of-its-kind health technology to the Apple Watch Series 7, in what could be a breakthrough for managing conditions such as diabetes more easily.
