This painstaking, function-by-function process creates raw programming code that can generate exactly the same binary file when compiled.</p><p>With that code in hand, coders can examine what makes the game tick and make improvements and changes at a much more granular level than with traditional modding. In the case of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, those improvements include bug fixes, reduced load times, improved rendering, widescreen monitor support, and a free-floating camera system, to name a few examples. The source code can also be used to generate ports of the game to new platforms like <a href=\"https://nightly.link/GTAmodding/re3/workflows/build-cmake-conan/master/ubuntu-latest-gl3.zip\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/AGraber/re3-nx/\">Switch</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/re3\">PlayStation Vita</a> (though these recompiled versions all require the copyrighted art and music files extracted from the original game).</p><p>Github contributor \"aap\" wrote that the project started in early 2018 \"initially as a way to test reversed collision and physics code inside the game\" by reverse-engineering specific DLLs. By 2019, the project grew to incorporate other contributors, who were able to generate a working executable by April of 2020. The team built off that code to generate a source version of <em>Vice City</em> that was ready by December 2020, aap wrote.</p><p>In addition to working on a similar decompilation for <em>Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories</em>, the source code team has also expressed interest in generating PS2 and Xbox ports of the PC version of the game, as well as additional bug fixes.</p></div></div>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"26b07b511b3ffa6b626d6ec0da6201247e4955bfa6aa92d934bbe969b382db79","category":"Tech"}
