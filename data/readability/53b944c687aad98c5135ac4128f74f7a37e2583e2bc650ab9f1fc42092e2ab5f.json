Those previous sales look downright cheap now, though, as bidding on another sealed <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <a href=\"https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-bros-wata-96-a-sealed-hangtab-1-code-mid-production-nes-nintendo-1985-usa/a/7242-93028.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515\">has already reached $372,000 on Heritage Auctions</a>.</p><p>That price comes after 13 early proxy bids, placed ahead of four days of live bidding for a large lot of comics and games memorabilia set to start on April 1. The bid also includes a 20 percent \"buyer's premium\" that will go to Heritage Auctions itself and not the game's current owner.</p><h2>Early provenance, excellent condition</h2><p>Unlike <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/meet-the-man-who-got-100000-for-a-copy-of-super-mario-bros/\">some earlier high-priced <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sales</a>, this copy isn't from the earliest production run of the game, which had a box sealed only with a small sticker and which was only sold in New York City during the NES' late 1985 test-market run. But this copy is one of the earliest <em>shrink-wrapped</em> editions of the game, sold only for a short time in late 1986, according to <a href=\"https://www.watagames.com/learn/blog/post/nes-black-box-variant-guide/\">WATA Games' guide</a>. This copy also received an incredible 9.6 out of 10 on WATA Games' quality scale, with an \"exceptional\" A+ seal in \"near-mint\" condition. It also still has an intact hangtab, meaning it never had its seal pierced for hanging it in a store display.</p><p>To put the current <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> pricing in context, the only known extant prototype of the unproduced Nintendo PlayStation—a unique and important part of video game history—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/the-worlds-only-known-nintendo-playstation-could-be-yours-for-over-13000/\">sold a year ago for $380,000</a> (with the buyer's premium included). And back in 2014, a \"world's largest\" collection of 11,000 video games <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-biggest-video-game-collection-goes-for-750000/\">sold for $750,000</a>.</p><p>While this is the oldest shrink-wrapped copy of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> Heritage has auctioned thus far, others could still exist among the millions and millions of copies of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> ever produced. Then again, Heritage Auctions video game specialist and consignment director Valarie McLeckie <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/why-is-this-copy-of-super-mario-bros-worth-a-record-114000/\">told Ars Technica last July</a>, \"I would suspect sealed cardboard hangtab copies [still available today] number in the single digits.\"</p><div><ul><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4274-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4274.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4274-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4274-1440x1080.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1463085\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1463085\"><span></span><p>Wata Games' chief grader examines a sealed copy of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (from a much later printing than this record sale).</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4284-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4284.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4284-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4284-1440x1080.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1463091\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1463091\"><span></span><p>The grader looks through a jeweler's loupe to identify any signs of resealing, restoration, color touching, or tampering.</p><p><span></span> Wata Games</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4278-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4278.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4278-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4278-1440x1080.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1463087\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1463087\"><span></span><p>Checking for seal and box authenticity.</p><p><span></span> Wata Games</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4280-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4280.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4280-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4280-1440x1080.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1463089\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1463089\"><span></span><p>Yup, the box has a back.

By and large, people are just starting to tune in to the fact that there is a rarity-based system involved.”</p><p>\"If video games are going to go the way of comics and coins, then there will one day be a million dollar video game sale, and I think [<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>] is that game if that's going to happen,\" WATA Games CEO Deniz Kahn told Ars in 2019.</p></div></div></div>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53b944c687aad98c5135ac4128f74f7a37e2583e2bc650ab9f1fc42092e2ab5f","category":"Tech"}
