{"title":"2022 Scott Addict Gravel goes longer and lower with a slick new shape","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/2022-scott-addict-gravel-goes-longer-and-lower-with-a-slick-new-shape/","date":1625756853000,"content":"<div><p></p><h4>Officially, this is the women-specific version of the new Addict Gravel. But as is often the case, I'd argue this is the more appealing paint scheme to have out of all the Addict Gravel models.</h4><p></p><div><p>It seems Scott is no longer hedging its bets when it comes to gravel. </p><p>Long content to use the same frame for gravel and cyclocross, Scott has finally developed a purpose-built Addict Gravel model with its own dedicated geometry and feature set. The longer and lower design, more generous tire clearance, additional carrying capacity, and more plentiful mounts all point toward a more versatile machine than before, but it also now boasts aero, lightweight, and integration features borrowed from the company’s road racing range for an extra dose of speed.</p><p>Combine that all together, and it makes for a pretty enticing-sounding package for gravel riders who want to go faster and farther on rougher terrain.</p><div><h2>Story Highlights</h2><ul><li><strong>What it is:</strong>Scott’s first dedicated carbon fiber gravel bike.</li><li><strong>Frame features:</strong>HMX or HMF carbon fiber modular monocoque construction, road-inspired aero tube shapes and cable integration, progressive gravel-specific geometry.</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong>930 g (claimed, 54 cm painted frame only); 8.12 kg (17.90 lb, medium Addict Gravel Tuned, without pedals)</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> US$3,000 to US$8,500 (pricing for other regions is TBC)</li></ul></div><h2>Dedicated gravel geometry</h2><p>Although the Addict Gravel has a long list of neat features pertaining to things like stiffness and aerodynamics (I’ll get to those in a minute), I’d argue the most significant change is its newly purpose-built geometry, which is no longer shared with the Addict CX.</p><p>Scott is following recent trends in the segment, giving the Addict a longer reach and more bottom bracket drop for more predictable handling on loose terrain. The increase in reach varies by size, with the XS gaining 14 mm, and the XL just 1 mm. Most sizes, however, have lengthened by 8-9 mm, and the bottom bracket drop is now 71 mm across the board as compared to 68 mm on the previous model.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2022-Scott-Addict-Gravel-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The new Addict Gravel’s longer front end should pay some nice dividends in terms of handling.</figcaption></figure><p>Chainstay length also grows from 422 mm to 425 mm, and an increase in fork rake enhances the front-center dimension further still, both of which yield big changes in total wheelbase that range from 6 to 25 mm, depending on size. Stem lengths have shortened correspondingly to keep the effective reach the same as before (sort of — keep reading). Head tube angles and stack heights carry over, meaning the Addict Gravel retains the predecessor’s comfortably stretched-out positioning.</p><p>All of this doesn’t quite put the new Addict Gravel at the pointier end of the field in terms of progressive gravel geometry — the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/devinci-hatchet-carbon-gravel-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Devinci Hatchet</a> and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/03/2020-bmc-urs-three-gravel-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">BMC URS</a> are still longer, for example. But the changes should make Scott’s latest model feel more stable at higher speeds or when the ground is sliding around beneath you, while low-speed agility should still be very good given the shorter stem lengths. Although I haven’t ridden the new model just yet (we’ve got one inbound), I expect the geometry changes to be very positive.</p><p>On the flipside, this also suggests a new cyclocross-specific Addict CX is in the works, along with its own dedicated geometry that likely will focus more on segment-specific attributes like decreased weight, mud clearance, and low-speed agility. We haven’t heard any news on that just yet, but it seems likely we’ll see something sooner than later.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scott-Addict-Gravel-geometry-1340x754.jpg\"></figure><h2>Bigger tires, more stuff</h2><p>Going along with the more gravel-centric geometry is more capability.</p><p>Most importantly, the official maximum tire size has grown from 700×40 mm to 700×45 mm; 650b tires will apparently fit, but aren’t really recommended. There are now three bottle mounts instead of two, there’s a feed bag mount on the top tube, and — hallelujah — there are now fender mounts front and rear with neatly hidden eyelets. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2022-Scott-Addict-Gravel-16-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Fender mounts front and rear, yay!</figcaption></figure><p>Scott is offering house-brand Syncros fenders, but it looks like others will also fit (perhaps with a bit of modification). Whichever way you go, Scott says you’ll still be able to fit 700×40 mm tires underneath.</p><p>There are no mounts on the fork, though, nor rear rack mounts, so this isn’t a diehard bikepacking rig. That said, it’s good to see Scott increase the overall carrying capacity of the Addict Gravel as compared to the previous model.</p><h2>Road-like aerodynamics, weight, and stiffness</h2><p>While the Addict Gravel is more like a dedicated gravel bike in some ways, it has leaned more into the road-racing space in others.</p><p>In terms of traditional performance metrics like weight and stiffness, Scott says the new Addict Gravel is a carbon copy of the Addict RC. A 54 cm Addict Gravel frame in the top-end HMX version is said to tip the scales at 930 g, while the matching fork comes in at 395 g. Both of those figures are greater than what I reported in <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/10/scott-addict-gravel-10-disc-review-sportier-end-spectrum/\" target=\"_blank\">my review of the Addict Gravel in 2017</a>, although it’s important to note that Scott quoted raw weights back then and painted weights now. As a result, the new frameset should be a fair bit lighter than before (probably somewhere around 100-150 g, although that hasn’t been verified yet).</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2022-Scott-Addict-Gravel-3-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The hidden cabling cleans things up around the handlebar area, and the frame clearly takes design cues from the Addict RC road racer.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of rigidity, Scott is claiming identical bottom bracket and head tube stiffness test results for the Addict Gravel vs. the Addict RC. I’m not sure where the previous model stands, but given Scott is unlikely to have taken a step backward there, the Addict Gravel should be plenty stiff in terms of pedaling efficiency and handling precision.</p><p>More interesting is how Scott has infused the Addict Gravel with the Addict RC’s aero tube shaping and front-end integration. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2022-Scott-Addict-Gravel-8-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The aero cues are obvious in the tube shaping, seatpost, and stem area.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the Addict Gravel frame features D-shaped tubing (and a matching D-shaped seatpost) that is presumed to be more aerodynamically efficient than the predecessor’s rounder profiles. To be clear, Scott doesn’t offer any specific claims that the new frameset is faster, but the implication is certainly there. That said, the D-shaped tube shapes — along with the dropped seatstays — are expected to yield more comfort, which would be a welcome change given the predecessor’s rather rough ride.</p><h2>An integrated front end and internal cabling</h2><p>Also aiding in the aerodynamic, weight, and ride quality departments is a new integrated front end on upper-end Addict Gravel models.</p><p>The Syncros Creston iC SL X one-piece carbon fiber handlebar-and-stem combo looks similar to the Creston iC SL Scott uses on the Addict RC, with that distinctive Y-shaped center section, flattened tops, and fully hidden cable routing. However, Syncros has made a number of changes to make this version more applicable to rougher terrain. </p><p>The tops are thinner to allow for more flex, there’s a more dramatically flattened portion just aft of the lever hoods on which to rest your palms, the drops are slightly flared, and there’s a sharper bend at the top of the hoods that increase the effective bar width. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2022-Scott-Addict-Gravel-23-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The integrated cockpit has a pronounced flare to the drops.</figcaption></figure><p>The drop dimensions have shrunk a bit, too. The reach is just 60 mm (a decrease of 15 mm), and the drop is 115 mm (a decrease of 10 mm). The drops also extend rearward by an additional 10 mm, all of which are intended to provide more comfort and control when you’re on the bumpy stuff (and it’s worth pointing out the 15 mm decrease in reach makes the total effective reach shorter than the old Addict Gravel). </p><p>Claimed weight for the Creston iC SL X is 335 g for a 100×420 mm size, and stem lengths vary from 70 to 120 mm so there will (hopefully) be a combination to suit the vast majority of riders.</p><p>As you’d expect, cable routing is fully internal with the one-piece front end, with lines running through the bar tops and the stem body before taking a downward turn to sit alongside the flattened steerer tube. And since the flattened tops obviously won’t accept standard accessory mounts, Syncros is offering its own mounts for various cycling computers, lights, and cameras.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2022-Scott-Addict-Gravel-10-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This schematic shows how everything is routed on the new Addict Gravel. I can’t help but wonder (on this and other frames with similar routing) if there might be any issues long-term with steerer tube wear.</figcaption></figure><p>Lower-end Addict Gravel models won’t get the one-piece treatment, and will instead use a separate bar and stem. Cables will be hidden beneath the bar tape as usual before taking a sharp bend into a cosmetic cover on the underside of the stem and then feeding into the frame alongside the steerer tube just as with other Addict Gravel versions. Although heavier and not quite as clean-looking, the broader sizing range alone will make this the more appealing option for some. Riders will be free to use whatever bar they like, for example, and stem lengths are more plentiful, too, running from 70 to 140 mm.</p><h2>Details, details</h2><p>There are a few more little things worth mentioning on the new Addict Gravel.</p><p>Naturally, the bike features 12 mm thru-axles front and rear, along with flat-mount disc brake interfaces. But whereas the rear brake mount is sized for 160 or 140 mm-diameter rotors as usual, the front one is adjusted for 160 or 180 mm rotors if riders want some extra stopping power. </p><p>Up top, those integrated cables might seem to only be handy in terms of aesthetics and aerodynamics. However, Scott rightfully points out that, without the usual clutter, it’ll be easier to attach handlebar bags should you want to do so (although something that requires a round handlebar like the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/route-werks-handlebar-bag-review-brilliant-design-brilliant-execution/\" target=\"_blank\">Route Werks</a> won’t work).</p><p>Out back, the rear derailleur hanger is replaceable, but Scott has neatly combined that piece with the thru-axle threads to save a few grams. Even better, bikes set up with mechanical drivetrains have the housing stop incorporated into that chunk of aluminum, too.</p><p>Moving to the middle of the bike, the Addict Gravel uses a bolt-on front derailleur mount. Should you prefer a single-chainring drivetrain, you can replace that mount with a flush cover, or even a dedicated mini chain guide if you need or want a little extra security.</p><p>Finally, the modestly sloping top tube still leaves plenty of room inside the main triangle for a frame bag — and to help fit everything in there, the down tube water bottle mount has three holes instead of the usual two so you have a little more flexibility in where you put things.</p><p>None of this stuff is remotely groundbreaking, of course, but it’s good to see regardless.</p><h2>Models and availability</h2><p>Scott will offer five Addict Gravel models in total. The Addict Gravel Tuned is the only one to be built around the top-end HMX frame, and is equipped with a SRAM Red eTap AXS wireless electronic groupset, a SRAM Red power meter crankset, and DT Swiss GRC 1100 carbon wheels. Retail price is US$8,500.</p><p>The second-tier Addict Gravel 10 comes with SRAM Force eTap AXS and DT Swiss GRC 1400 for US$5,700.</p><p>The Addict Gravel 30 moves to Shimano with a GRX 810/600 mechanical groupset and Syncros RP2.0 wheels. Finally, there’s the women-specific Contessa Addict Gravel 15 with the same build kit as the unisex Addict Gravel 30, but with unique paint jobs, component sizing, and touch points. Both of those cost US$3,000.</p><p>There will also be an Addict Gravel 20, though the specifics of that model aren’t being released until August.</p><p>All of the complete bikes will come stock with 700×45 mm tires. And for the DIYers, there will also be a bare Addict Gravel HMX frameset available in certain regions. </p><p>Pricing for all the Addict Gravel models in other regions is to be confirmed.</p><p>Surely at this point you’re wondering about lower-priced aluminum models? Nothing has been officially announced, but Scott is sure to supplement the carbon fiber Addict Gravel with new Speedster aluminum gravel bikes in short order.</p><figure><div><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scott-Addict-Gravel-20-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Fades are clearly in.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scott-Addict-Gravel-30-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>It’s a bit reptilian, but I like it.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scott-Addict-Gravel-Tuned-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The top-end version almost seems reasonably priced when you compare it to road racing bikes with similar spec.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scott-Contessa-Addict-Gravel-15-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Complete Addict Gravel models start at a fairly reasonable US$3,000.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></div></figure><h2>Ride report pending</h2><p>CyclingTips wasn’t able to send anyone to the launch event for this bike so we unfortunately don’t have firsthand reports to share on how the new bike performs.
