This week, we’re addressing a poignant question by one of our readers: “Can Cycling Clothing ever really be Green?”. In order to answer this question in a constructive manner, we’ve broken it down into the following three questions:</p><ol><li>How is your brand working towards improving the sustainability of the cycling clothing line?</li><li>What are the most environmentally friendly materials you use and why?</li><li>What is the least environmentally friendly fabric you use and, what more environmentally friendly can it be replaced with in future?</li></ol><p>This week we are joined by Rapha, Leatt and Troy Lee Designs, to find out how they are working to improve how “green” their cycling clothing is. Contributing are:</p><ul><li><p>Duncan Coulter, the <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rapha</a> Sustainability Manager</p></li><li><p>Kris Kurowski, Marketing Manager at <a href=\"https://www.leatt.com/gb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leatt</a></p></li><li><span>Craig</span> “Stikman” Glaspell, the Global Bicycle Brand Director at <a href=\"https://troyleedesigns.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Troy Lee Designs</a></li></ul><p><strong>How is your brand working towards improving the sustainability of the cycling clothing line?</strong></p><p><strong>Leatt: </strong>There is a short answer to this question, which is that the most sustainable path is to make good quality products that last for years of abuse. This is path Leatt has been on since the beginning and will continue to pursue.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-medrectangle-3\"></span></p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents.jpg\" alt=\"leatt 4 enduro helmet martha gill manual\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/leatt-4.0-enduro-helmet-dbx-18-vents-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>The slightly longer and more complex answer, is that we are working step by step internally and externally to have a smaller environmental foot print. This is a long process which is constantly changing with new technology available.</p><p>All Leatt products from 2022 will come in biodegradable plastic free (and micro-plastic free) packaging. Also, many MTB garments will be made from sustainable fabrics made from recycled tree pulp in Austria as well as recycled coffee grounds.</p><p><strong>Rapha: </strong>It is worth prefacing all of this with the caveat that ‘sustainability’ is a broad topic, covering both social and environmental issues, often in ways that are intimately connected. Given that these questions are explicitly referring to ‘green’ and materials (and for the sake of brevity) I’ll stick to environmental impacts, meaning greenhouse gas emissions, water, pollutants and waste. For those that want to know more, we’ve created an Impact &amp; Sustainability page to share the full range of work we’re doing at Rapha, including updates on our Impact Commitments: 15 ambitious, measurable and public-facing targets that we are striving for in the coming years.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Long Sleeve Pro Team Training Jersey, Hannah Barnes\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Long-Sleeve-Pro-Team-Training-Jersey_Hannah-Barnes-Girona-riding-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a></p><p>With that in mind, when it comes to the environmental impact of our clothing, we can break it down into three phases: product creation, product use and ‘end of life’.</p><p>In the product creation phase, we’re fortunate that the practice of Life Cycle Assessments, along with a body of research on climate change in the apparel sector, has been growing over the years. Because of this, we know that the bulk of our environmental footprint comes from the extraction of raw materials and the manufacturing of our fabrics. In light of this, we’ve been prioritizing our efforts in this area for the last two years.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Pro Team Winter road riding racing training collection, Pro Team Winter Jacket\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Winter-road-riding-racing-training-collection_Pro-Team-Winter-Jacket_open-riding-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Part of the challenge with this finding is that, like most other brands, we do not own our manufacturing facilities, so there are limits to how much we can drive change.

For our brand this was a huge shift from a brand that once did not look at this area much at all; in addition to having a division of the business that isn’t all that ‘green’ (motocross, haha).</p><p>But, we made the switch without delivering that cost increase to our customers and our apparel lines simply got better.

We want to be able to offer our customers products with third party independent ECO certification.</p><p><strong>Rapha: </strong>To go the other way and look at our least environmentally friendly material is a little easier, and I’ll answer the question in a more straightforward way: cotton. Cotton is a highly resource intensive crop. At Rapha, we tend to use more cotton, by weight, per product than we do other fabrics, mainly because they tend to be our lifestyle pieces. And we also produce a lot of them. So, when we ran the numbers on our material portfolio, cotton jumped out as a clear priority for us to improve upon.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha Women's All Day Leggings and Shorts,&nbsp;BCN lounging\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-297x186.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-800x500.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-120x75.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-768x480.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-1536x960.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-696x435.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-1068x668.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-672x420.jpg 672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-297x186.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-800x500.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-120x75.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-768x480.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-1536x960.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-696x435.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-1068x668.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rapha-Womens-All-Day-Leggings-and-Shorts_BCN-672x420.jpg 672w\"></a></p><p>Thankfully, cotton has a much lower-impact sibling in the form of organic cotton, which is becoming increasingly more available. In a single season we’ve transitioned nearly all our lifestyle pieces to organic cotton, making significant savings on carbon and water in the process. An additional benefit is that the traceability of the organic certification means we now have increased visibility into our supply chain, enabling us to give our customers assurance we’re sourcing from regions with low-risk of modern slavery. Keep an eye out for our organic cotton lifestyle collection later in the year.</p><p><strong>Troy Lee Designs: </strong>Packaging materials are probably the thing the entire industry can do a better job at.
