Annemiek Van Vleuten (Movistar) finished third a few seconds behind.</p><p>“It’s mostly about the Mur in the end but the race was hard from the beginning,” Van der Breggen said at the finish “The pace was really high on all the climbs and I think we made some tactical mistakes in the race so we needed to chase but the team did really great to fix that and even in the end Demi closed the gap almost to Ruth, that’s incredible. If you make a decision like that as a young girl it says a lot about your future. Of course, I am really happy that I could do it too and I could take this win for the team. It was a good battle with Kasia I must say, she was strong, but I am really happy I could win this one.”</p><p>“It’s a strange thought that I am sitting here for the last time. Next year I won’t bother the girls anymore, it’s up to somebody else. That’s a good thing, I am really happy to finish it off like this.”</p><h2>How it happened</h2><p>After some small breakaways spent time off the front the first major attack of the day came from Ashleigh Moolman Pasio of SD Worx on the Côte d’Ereffe with 19.4 km to go. The attack by Moolman Pasio set off a counter move from USA national champion Ruth Winder (Trek-Segafredo). Winder’s move put pressure on SD Worx, Canyon-SRAM, and Liv Racing to chase.</p><p>Elise Chabbey, (Canyon-SRAM) who spent a good amount of time in a three-person move earlier in the race, attacked the chase to chase down Winder on her own before the race approached the final 15 km. The chasing peloton brought Chabbey back with 11.2 km to go when Chabbey crashed going into the base of the penultimate climb.</p><p>On the slopes of the Côte du chain des Gueuses Van Vleuten made her signature attack. The European champion was matched by a group of top riders included Elisa Longo Borghini (Trek-Segafredo), Niewiadoma, and Van der Breggen. Marianne Vos (Jumbo-Visma) suffered under Van Vleuten’s pressure and was distanced from the elite group.</p><p>With 9.2 km to go Mavi García of Alé BTC Ljubljana laid down an attack that was countered by the World Champion. Next it was Demi Vollering (SD Worx) and Niewiadoma. With all the stop-and-start action behind Winder had gained a 30-second advantage with 5 km to go. As the only team with multiple riders chasing, SD Worx had to commit to chasing down the lone rider out front.</p><p>Vollering single-handedly brought Winder within seconds of the chasers before the final kilometre of the race. Winder took the right turn into the Mur de Huy with only a few hundred meters on the chase as Van der Breggen moved to the front of the race.</p><p>Van der Breggen set the pace up the final ascent of the Mur de Huy with Longo Borghini and Niewiadoma close behind. Van Vleuten made her way back to Van der Breggen as Longo Borghini was distanced.</p><p>In the final few hundred meters, Niewiadoma surged ahead but Van der Breggen was the strongest on the day and passed the Polish rider with 100 meters to go to take her seventh La Flèche Wallonne victory in a row. Niewiadoma held on for second and Van Vleuten crossed the line in third.</p><h2>Results, Top 10</h2><p>1 VAN DER BREGGEN Anna (SD Worx)<br>2 NIEWIADOMA Kasia (Canyon-SRAM)<br>3 VAN VLEUTEN Annemiek (Movistar)<br>4 LONGO BORGHINI Elisa (Trek-Segafredo)</p><p><em>More to come…</em></p></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"da9087ebfb98a63ab65d1fe745533de73b29cd9953da05f9cb61f93bbb7b656e","category":"Cycling"}
