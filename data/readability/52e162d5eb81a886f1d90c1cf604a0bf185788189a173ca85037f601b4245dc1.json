The group is planning to offer videos, webinars, and other materials to help advertisers understand how to use data in an \"Apple-friendly manner.\"</p><p>\"No IDFA? No Problem,\" reads the website, which also offers articles like \"What does the IDFA change mean? and \"How does SKAdNetwork work?\" SKAdNetwork is a privacy-focused ad platform that Apple is providing to developers as an alternative to current ad tracking measures.</p><p>The partnership includes Liftoff, Fyber, Chartboost, Singular, InMobi and Vungle, all of which are mobile advertising companies that will be impacted by Apple's upcoming changes.</p><p>Starting with the launch of iOS 14.5, Apple will begin enforcing App Tracking Transparency, a feature first announced when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> debuted following the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ad-anti-tracking-ios-14/\">delayed the implementation</a> of the feature to give developers extra time to adjust, but the delays are ending in early spring.</p><p>With App Tracking Transparency, developers are no longer able to access a user's IDFA or advertising identifier on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> without first obtaining express user permission. When access to the IDFA is declined, apps are also expected not to use workaround methods to track users against their wishes as well.</p><p>The IDFA is used by app developers and ad companies to track user behavior across apps and websites for ad targeting purposes, something that will no longer be possible when people begin declining to allow ad tracking functionality.</p><p>Users will be able to disable ad tracking on an app-by-app basis, with apps required to show a pop up that will ask users if they want to be tracked. Ad companies assume that the majority of people are going to decline this request, which will have a broad impact on advertising on iOS devices going forward.</p><p>Facebook has been the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/\">most vocally against</a> Apple's planned ad tracking changes because App Tracking Transparency will impact Facebook's ad revenue. Facebook has claimed that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ios-14-apple-privacy-update-impacts-small-business-ads\">harming small businesses</a>, but Facebook's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/23/facebook-employees-criticize-apple-campaign/\">own employees</a> have criticized the anti-Apple campaign and the EFF <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/19/eff-calls-facebook-criticism-of-apple-laughable/\">has called</a> Facebook's efforts to get Apple to drop the privacy changes \"laughable.\"</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/14/heart-month-activity-challenge/\">Apple's Heart Month Activity Challenge Requires 60 Minutes of Exercise on Valentine's Day</a></h3><p>Saturday February 13, 2021 10:15 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/frank-mcshan/\" rel=\"author\">Frank McShan</a></p><p>Today only, Apple Watch owners can complete a new Apple Watch activity challenge in celebration of Heart Month, which is aimed at promoting cardiovascular health.
