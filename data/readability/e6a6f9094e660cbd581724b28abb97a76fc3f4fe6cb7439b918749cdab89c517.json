{"title":"Best Bike Multitools of 2021 – The Right Mini-Tool is a Bike Shop in Your Pocket","link":"https://bikerumor.com/2021/06/25/best-bike-multitools-minitools/","date":1624633895000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>As a cyclist, a good multitool can be a true ride-saver. From tightening bolts, to adjusting a loose headset, to an emergency seat height change, a mini-tool is a cyclist’s best friend for on-the-fly repairs. Even if you’re not the most mechanically inclined rider, you still should have a multi-tool tucked into your pocket or saddlebag at all times.</p><p>This Bikerumor editor has found herself Googling “how to repair brake lever” in the middle of the forest on one memorable ride and was able to tweak it with a phillips head screwdriver. I once used a T25 Torx key to move a bolt from a disc rotor and to re-attach a cleat that somehow lost a bolt in the middle of the Las Vegas desert. Without a minitool, I would still be stranded.</p><p>So, multitools are important. There’s a lot of variety and a huge range of price points. Some multitools only offer the bare essentials in order to keep the cost (and weight) down. Others have everything but the kitchen sink.</p><p>The best options typically fall somewhere in between the two extremes, and depending on the type of ride you’re doing, one multitool could be better than another. Having more than one is ideal. In a perfect world, you’d have one attached to every bike in a saddlebag (or in your hydration pack) so that you never leave home without it.</p><p>Here, we’re rounding up the best multitools for whatever type of ride you’re on.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-aero-gravel_aerodynamic-carbon-gravel-bike_roadside-repairs.jpg\"><img

Unior makes everything from the smallest multitool to modular tool benches, making them a favorite for bike mechanics. Bikerumor staff has found Unior’s multitools to be long lasting, easy to use, and very well made—especially for the price point ($40).</p><p>The Unior Euro17 has every tool you could possibly need, and possibly a few that you won’t. At 184 grams, it’s not the lightest on the list, but that’s partially because it has so many features, and because the tool spindles are chrome-plated while the tips are coated with a black oxide to increase durability and prevent rust.</p><ul><li>Number of features: 17</li><li>Includes: 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8mm hex wrenches; T10 and T25 torxes; 1.0 and 5.0 flat screwdrivers; a small phillips screwdriver; a chain breaker; Schrader and Presta valve tools; spoke wrenches for 3.3, 3.45 and DT nipples</li><li>Weight: 184 grams</li><li>Price: $40</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Long-lasting, ergonomically friendly<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Not the lightest, wide design can make it tough to reach tight places</p><h3><span>&nbsp;BEST BUDGET : <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087WH74BN/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lezyne Rap II 18-Piece</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128.jpg\" alt=\"Lezyne Rap II Co2 tool\" width=\"1500\" height=\"866\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-297x171.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-800x462.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-120x69.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-768x443.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-696x402.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-1068x617.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/26154238/Lezyne-Rap-II-Co2-tool-e1622058156128-727x420.jpg 727w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>The Lezyne Rap II multitool comes in several size options ranging from a 6-tool to a 24-tool configuration. But we like the 18-piece because it has a chain breaker. (Check out the frequently asked questions below if you’re wondering why you need a chainbreaker.)</p><p>The real standout here is the disc brake wedge, which can be incredibly helpful if you’ve accidentally squeezed the disc brake lever without the wheel in place during a roadside repair. It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but this Bikerumor editor has ended up with scratched pads and damaged discs from trying to pry pads apart with hex keys (and on one memorable occasion, a quarter… which did not work).</p><p>This multitool is a mere 148 grams—light for the amount of tools it contains—and it boasts an anti-corrosion black coating to avoid rust if sitting in a soggy saddlebag. We love that there’s even a custom magnetic spot where you could attach an emergency quick link for fixing a broken chain with your chain breaker.</p><ul><li>Number of features: 18</li><li>Includes: 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8mm hex wrenches; T10 and T25 torxes; a phillips head screwdriver; a chainbreaker; 8 and 10mm wrenches; four different-sized spoke wrenches; disc brake wedge; rotor turning tool</li><li>Weight: 148 grams</li><li>Price: $25</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Disc brake wedge, inexpensive<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Like the Unior, the wider design can make adjustments with limited space a challenge</p><h3><span>&nbsp;<strong>BEST MTB MULTI-TOOL</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F189285%2Fcrankbrothers-m20-multi-tool&amp;ctc=BRBGOutdoorBikingMultitools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crankbrothers M20</a>&nbsp;</span></h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function.jpg\" alt=\"crankbrothers multitool m20 with tubeless repair plugs for mtb\" width=\"1200\" height=\"787\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-297x195.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-800x525.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-768x504.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-696x456.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-1068x700.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-640x420.jpg 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/new-crankbrother-multitool-m20-tubeless-tire-repair-function-741x486.jpg 741w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>One Bikerumor staffer has been swearing by his <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2015/06/17/limited-edition-crankbrothers-m-series-multi-tools-get-colorful/\">Crankbrothers M19</a> for the last 20 years.

The Park Tool I-Beam Multitool (also known as the IB-2) is your minimalist dream come true. We like the IB-2 for two reasons: First, the “IB” stands for I-Beam, the shape of its main carrier, which adds strength and stiffness while minimizing bulk since the tools sit outboard of the carrier.</p><p>This makes it one of the smallest full-featured tools, which is the second reason we love this. It’s tiny, yet has everything we’d need for quick fixes and adjustments, except maybe a Phillips head screwdriver. If you don’t mind leaving extras like a chain breaker at home, this one tucks in anywhere, leaving more room for tubes, CO2, etc. And it’s Park Tool, so it’s no surprise this one’s been on constant duty for years with zero issues.

The compact tool allows users to gain leverage by moving around the sticks into the optimal T-shape configuration depending on which hex key you need.</p><p>The other bonus? Fix It Sticks come with a small bracket that allows them to mount behind any standard water bottle cage, so you can attach a set to every bike you own. The tools themselves work fantastically: The T-shape provides leverage for even the stickiest of bolts and allows you to quickly spin out bolts – just like a shop grade t-handle hex wrench. There’s also something to be said for simplicity, especially when the tools can be stored on your bike and you don’t have to think about packing them for a ride.</p><p>The Fix It Sticks are available in multiple configurations, though the originals are shown here with fixed bits. Fix It Sticks also offers a replaceable version with extra bits, a ratcheting T-Way version, and many other accessories.</p><p>We’d also like to add an honorable mention to the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2017/11/28/spurcycle-ultra-light-ultra-compact-precision-titanium-bicycle-multi-tool/\">Spurcycle Ti Tool titanium T-handle wrench and bits</a> for similar reasons: This tool is tiny, light and can be customized to just what you want to carry.

At 215 grams, this tool roll-up is fully loaded and ready for pretty much anything.</p><p>It’s bulkier than a small multitool, yes, but it’s also easier to use: The ratchet allows better leverage, and having separate spoke keys makes trailside wheel truing much easier. There’s even a 5nm torque limiter which essentially turns the ratchet into a mini torque wrench with a preset value.</p><p>Since the pack holds all of your critical tire repair pieces, all you need to add is a minipump and you’re ready for anything.&nbsp;And yes, it is small enough to fit in a jersey pocket, though it will be bulky.</p><ul><li>Number of features: 18 plus tube patches</li><li>Includes: 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8mm hex wrenches; T15, T25 and T30 torxes; phillips head screwdriver; chain breaker; three spoke keys; 5Nm Torque limiter; two tire levers; six tube patches; a chain link holder; and a ratchet attachment.

When you need it, everything unrolls for easy access.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1198\" height=\"952\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826.jpg 1198w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-297x236.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-800x636.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-120x95.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-768x610.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-696x553.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-1068x849.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-529x420.jpg 529w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826.jpg 1198w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-297x236.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-800x636.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-120x95.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-768x610.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-696x553.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-1068x849.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29104756/Wolf-Tooth-Components-B-Rad-Teklite-roll-top-bags-1l-06-l-small-large-gear-storage-bags-with-only-strap-e1623944677826-529x420.jpg 529w\"></a></p><p>It’s a similar story for the Wolf Tooth Components B-RAD TekLite Roll-Top Bag, but in a product that quickly straps to your frame or mount to one of their B-RAD bases. Available in a small (0.6L, $39.95) or large (1L, $44.95) bag, they’re big enough to include an inner tube and other repair essentials inside, and you can strap them low on your bike to keep the center of gravity as low as possible. The roll-top makes it quick and easy to access while remaining watertight, though it’s not as well organized as the Camelbak Tool Roll.</p><p>Most importantly, either of these products can be pre-loaded and ready to go at a moment’s notice. If you’re like us, that’s always one of the stumbling blocks to getting out on a ride: making sure you have everything you need for your ‘flat kit.’ But when it’s all prepackaged and ready to go, it becomes one less thing you have to worry about on your way out of the door.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red.jpg\" alt=\"m20 crankbrothers multitools available in gold black red colorways\" width=\"1200\" height=\"578\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-297x143.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-800x385.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-120x58.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-768x370.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-696x335.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-1068x514.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-872x420.jpg 872w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-297x143.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-800x385.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-120x58.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-768x370.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-696x335.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-1068x514.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/m20-crankbrothers-multitools-gold-black-red-872x420.jpg 872w\"></a></p><h2>How to choose a bike multitool</h2><p>What’s the <em>best</em> multi-tool? If there is one, we haven’t found it yet. Why is that? Like the riders themselves, each bike has a unique set of requirements from the tools needed to service it. That means that while one multi-tool might be perfect for one bike, it could be nearly useless for the next.</p><p><strong>So how do I find the one that’s best for <em>my</em> bike?</strong></p><p>Before purchasing a tool, take a look at the hardware on your bike: Use an Allen key/hex wrench set and a Torx wrench to figure out what size bolts are on your bike and take notes of which sizes you need, and which parts seem the most likely to need in-ride adjustment.</p><p>Also, take note of any nuts, bolts, or screws that may need an extra long or skinny tool to reach. It’s fairly common to have the right tool on your multitool, only it won’t reach due to the shape of the tool and the position on the bike.</p><p><strong>Find a tool that has the basics:</strong></p><ul><li>Hex Wrenches (at least 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8mm)</li><li>Phillips head screwdriver or flathead screwdriver, preferably both</li><li>Chain tool (unless you have a separate one)</li><li>Torx in T-25 (only if your bike uses Torx rather than Hex keys—some older or inexpensive bikes may not require this)</li><li>Other Torx sizes like T20, T30, etc. (this is not as common, but if you need a T20 for your stem bolts, and you don’t have one with you, you’ll be in trouble)</li></ul><p><strong>Ergonomics<br></strong>You also want a tool that feels good in your hand: When tightening or loosening tricky bolts, having a tool that feels sturdy when pressure is applied is important. Tools like FixIt Sticks are great because they’re designed to provide better leverage so you have to work less for the same result. They’re also effectively skinnier, and fit better into tight places.</p><p>Also, if purchasing a multitool with a built-in chain tool, consider how easy it is to use. Does it come apart in two pieces for easy positioning? Or does is require twisting the whole tool in a way that makes it difficult to accurately guide the chain pin?</p><p><strong>Ease of Use<br></strong>When it comes to quality, look for tools that don’t fall open when you shake them, or accidentally open other tools when you’re using it. But you also want to be able to flip out any part of it easily. (There’s nothing worse than trying to make an adjustment to your handlebars in the middle of winter and struggling to get your 6mm Allen key pulled out.)</p><p><strong>Price Point<br></strong>Price point obviously plays a role, but most of our top picks fall into the $30-50 category. You can get cheap multitools for sub-$10 at Walmart or Amazon, but many of them will fall apart after a few uses, won’t have all the pieces you need, or will quickly rust. It’s better to buy a quality minitool for a bit more now and not worry about replacing it ever again.

It allows you to “break” the chain by pressing out a pin. It used to be that you could push the chain pin out part way, remove the damaged link, and then push the pin back in, reconnecting the two ends of the chain. However, modern drivetrains with more speeds (10, 11, 12, and up) often have chains that don’t really allow this technique.</p><p>For those, you’ll need to have a specific <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PNLV2K7?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quick link</a> or steel pin that you can use to reconnect the chain. Quick links are the best option, as they allow you to ‘cut out’ the broken link from your chain and add the quick link for a permanent repair that usually won’t end up shortening your chain.</p><p>Some multi-tools even provide storage locations for spare chain master links. These are a great addition to your tool kit, provided you get the right one for your chain (they vary based on specific chains).</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride.jpg\" alt=\"Rapha+Outdoor Voices women's cycling collection, casual performance riding kit clothing collaboration, photo by Cait Oppermann\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RaphaOutdoor-Voices-womens-cycling-collection_casual-performance-riding-kit-clothing-collaboration_photos-by-Cait-Oppermann_CA-group-ride-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p><strong>When do I need a multi tool?<br></strong>You should always have a multi-tool on you when you’re riding. Even if you’re just running errand around town, you can end up stopped in your tracks by a seat post that loosens and starts to drop. The same is true for always having a mini-pump, spare tube, and tube patches on hand for every ride. Flat tires happen anytime—and usually when you’re least expecting them.</p><p>Even if you don’t have a firm grasp on how to use them, if you have one, you can usually figure things out. Whether that’s consulting YouTube while trail side, or being saved by a good Samaritan (who might not have the right tool for the job, but knows how to fix the issue), it’s always good to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Does my multitool need maintenance?<br></strong>Thankfully, they’re pretty set-it-and-forget it. Some, like the CrankBrothers one with a tire plug, will need replacement pieces if you use them in a ride. But for the most part, just keeping your multitool relatively dry and clean (especially if you used the chain breaker on a gnarly chain) should be enough to keep it from rusting.</p><p>The same goes for a multi-tool that hasn’t been used in a while. If it’s stashed in a saddle bag that is subject to any kind of moisture, you might find your multi-tool is rusted. We recommend periodically checking it, and wiping it down with a rust/corrosion inhibitor and lubricating the pivots with a light lubricant if needed (you don’t want the multi-tool to become slippery, so wipe away any excess).</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01.jpg\" alt=\"silca t-handle folio tool set review\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/01102759/silca-t-handles-hex-torx-wrench-set-review-01-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p><strong>What’s the difference between hex wrenches and Allen keys? Is it Torque or Torx?<br></strong>Hex wrenches and Allen keys are the same thing, and often used interchangeably (and you may also hear the term hex key or Allen wrench). ‘Allen’ is a registered trademark of the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut from way back in 1910. ‘Hex wrench or key’ is effectively the ’tissue’ to Allen’s ‘Kleenex.’</p><p>These bits have hexagonal cross sections and are generally measured in millimeters (Metric instead of SAE).</p><p>Torx, sometimes mistakenly referred to as ‘torque’ wrenches, have a six point star-shaped cross section—think of them as a cross between a Phillips head screwdriver and a hex key. They’re less likely to strip bolts that are being tightened or loosened, but require the wrench to be perfectly perpendicular to the bolt.</p><p>Note: Torx wrenches are numbered in units of five with a T, and most higher-end bikes will use some combination of T-10, T20, T-25, and T30 for various bolts from chainrings to stems. It’s worth spending time looking at all of the different bolts on all of your bikes, noting which ones use what and creating a master list, especially if you find this confusing!</p><p><strong>What about Torque wrenches?<br></strong>Because it’s pronounced similarly to Torx, there can be confusion between the two. Torque wrenches are any wrench that allows you to tighten a bolt, screw, or nut to a desired torque value. While not completely necessary for multi-tools, you can find compact multi-tools with built in torque wrenches (like the Syncros kit above). These can be particularly useful if you have ultra-light weight carbon components on your bike and don’t trust yourself not to over-tighten things.</p><p><strong>Do I really need an 8mm?<br></strong>That big hex key on your multitool might seem like overkill, but for some pedals and cranks, it could come in handy. Cranks can occasionally come loose (if they’re not initially torqued properly), and being able to tighten them on the fly may save your ride. There are many cranksets that don’t use 8mm crank bolts though, so again, check to see what your bike uses.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1.jpg\" alt=\"tightening a loose crank mid-ride with a multitool\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03112027/bicycle-mini-tool-buyers-guide-necessary-bits-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\"></a></p><p>(Note: If your crank does come loose on a ride, it’s because it wasn’t torqued properly. The 8mm on the multi-tool might be able to save the ride, but then you’ll want to retorque it properly once you get home, or get a mechanic to take a look.)</p><p>The same goes for pedals. Many have an 8mm hex fitting on the back of the spindle, but some use a 6mm hex, and some have no hex fitting at all. While traveling, being able to install and remove pedals can be very important, but often require leverage. One trick to increase the leverage from folding tools is to extend all of the tools on the opposite side of the multi-tool from the 6 or 8mm hex, and place your hand over the end to effectively increase the length of the tool so that you get a slightly longer lever to work with.</p><p><strong>Why would I need a ratchet-style multitool?<br></strong>While fold-out tools are great in a pinch and fit in your bag or pocket much better than a bigger tool wrap like the ones from Blackburn and Syncros, the ratchet can help you gain leverage and avoid stripping bolts when you’re trying to loosen or tighten harder-to-access bolts. And sometimes, having the extra length is critical: While having an 8mm can be a ride-saver, if you can’t get enough leverage or properly reach the bolt, you won’t have much luck tightening it. If you find yourself regularly struggling with stuck bolts or know you don’t have a lot of hand strength, a ratchet-style tool is a smart move.</p></div></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e6a6f9094e660cbd581724b28abb97a76fc3f4fe6cb7439b918749cdab89c517","category":"Cycling"}
