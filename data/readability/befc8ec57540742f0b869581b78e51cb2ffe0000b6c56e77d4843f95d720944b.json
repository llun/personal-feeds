Most notably, we got our first glimpse of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3605528/ios-14-5-features-release-date-beta-how-to-install.html\">iOS 14.5</a> and it's shaping up to be a huge update, with a new feature that lets you&nbsp;unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch, a landscape boot screen for the iPad, and dozens of new emoji. But March could be even bigger, with rumors that new products are on the way.</p><div data-tracking-category=\"In-article TOC\"><legend>Table of Contents <i></i></legend><ul><li data-pagenum=\"1\" data-tocnum=\"1\"><a href=\"#toc-1\">Rumored new products</a></li><li data-pagenum=\"1\" data-tocnum=\"2\"><a href=\"#toc-2\">Apps and software updates</a></li><li data-pagenum=\"1\" data-tocnum=\"3\"><a href=\"#toc-3\">Services</a></li></ul><p>Show More <i></i></p></div><h2 id=\"toc-1\">Rumored new products</h2><p>We don't know anything for sure, but based on rumors and speculation, we're going to get at least a couple of new hardware releases in March. Remember, last year we got a new MacBook Air and iPad Pro, the year before we got second-gen AirPods and a new lineup of services as well as iMac, iPad mini, and iPad Air refreshes, and in 2018, Apple launched a new 9.7-inch iPad with Apple Pencil support. So there's a good chance something is coming. Here's what we think we might get:</p><h3>AirTags</h3><p>We've been hearing about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3536073/apple-airtags-faq.html\">Apple's Tile competitors</a>&nbsp;for nearly two years now, but the latest rumors suggest that they might actually land this month. According to leaks, they're small, circular Bluetooth devices that will attack to things like keys and bags so you can find them when they're lost. They'll most likely tap into the iPhone's ultrawide band chip for super precise location tracking.</p><h3>iPad Pro</h3><p>We last got an update to the iPad Pro last March, but at lot has changed since then. While the upcoming update will likely be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ipad-pro-2021-release-date-price-specs-rumours-3788259/\">minor one</a>, it will reportedly bring the iPad up to speed with he iPhone 12's A14 chip and 5G connectivity. Some rumors also suggest the flagship tablet could get a new mini LED screen, but that probably won't come until later in the year.</p><div><p><img onclick=\"jwplayer('bottomRightPlayer').remove(); this.style.display = 'none';\" id=\"jw-standalone-close-button\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\"></p><div id=\"bottomRightPlayer\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Video Player\" role=\"application\" aria-describedby=\"jw-shortcuts-tooltip-explanation\"><div dir=\"auto\"><p>Apple Watch 6 vs SE vs 3: Which model is right for your wrist?</p></div><p><span aria-live=\"assertive\"></span><span aria-live=\"assertive\">Volume 0%</span></p></div></div><h3>AirPods</h3><p>It's been nearly two years since we got an AirPods update, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3587391/apple-reportedly-plans-to-launch-new-airpods-models-possible-third-homepod-speaker.html\">there are plenty of rumors</a> about new models in the works. Most recently, a leaked photo showed shorter stems for the iconic buds, and other rumors have suggested that nouse canceling could also make its way to the cheaper model.</p><h2 id=\"toc-2\">Apps and software updates</h2><h3>iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5</h3><p>Apple launched the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3605528/ios-14-5-features-release-date-beta-how-to-install.html\">iOS 14.5 beta</a> in February, and it's already in the second beta. Development will continue throughout the month and it's possible that the wide release hits devices before the end of March, especially if new iPad Pros arrive. There are a few cool new features: apps will now need to request permission to use third-party ad trackers, you'll be able to unlock your phone using Face ID while wearing a mask and an Apple Watch (which requires watchOS 7.4), and perhaps most importantly, the Apple logo will be horizontal when restarting an iPad in a keyboard dock.</p><h3>macOS Big Sur 11.3</h3><p>Like iOS 14.5, Apple is well on the way toward releasing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3605988/new-features-in-macos-big-sur-113-safari-customization-options-enhanced-support-for-iphoneipad-apps.html\">macOS Big Sur 11.3</a>, having recently pushed the second beta to developers, so it could land on your Mac in March. There <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3605988/new-features-in-macos-big-sur-113-safari-customization-options-enhanced-support-for-iphoneipad-apps.html\">aren't nearly as many new features</a> as iOS 14.5, but you will get a new customizable Safari Start page as well as the ability to sort and print reminders, among other changes.</p><h2 id=\"toc-3\">Services</h2><h3>Apple TV+</h3><p>Apple usually releases new shows, movies, and episodes to Apple TV+ on Fridays at around midnight Eastern time.
