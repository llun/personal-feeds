But apparently, one new product that won’t be part of that event is the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3150771/airpods-faq-price-features-how-to-tips.html\">next generation of Apple’s AirPods</a>.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\" rel=\"nofollow\">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported</a> that the new AirPods are not scheduled to go into mass production until the third quarter of this year, which likely signals a fall release. Kuo’s statement was backed up on Tuesday by Weibo poster&nbsp;<a href=\"https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4615489663534861\" rel=\"nofollow\">l0vetodream</a>, who has correctly leaked Apple info in the past, including Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, the HomePod mini, and more.</p><p>Last week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1369642089387024386\" rel=\"nofollow\">LeaksApplePro</a> tweeted photos of the purported AirPods 3, which have shorter stems and earbuds that look like those on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3452661/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a>, but without the ear tips. LeaksApplePro&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1369601240930344961\" rel=\"nofollow\">claimed&nbsp;</a>that the new AirPods would be part of Apple’s March release, a rumor that now runs counter to Kuo and lOvetodream. With so many leaks, we expected the new AirPods would be arriving within weeks, but perhaps that's no longer that case.</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_12744fd1a3273f993f0ca4b4d57d698e\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01f0y0h2nhp5n7jpaks3xd2dw1\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/leaksapplepro_airpods_2021-100881009-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'><a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1369642089387024386&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Twitter</a> </div>leaksapplepro airpods 2021\"><img alt=\"leaksapplepro airpods 2021\" width=\"1200\" height=\"788\" data-imageid=\"100881009\" data-license=\"Supplied Art\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/leaksapplepro_airpods_2021-100881009-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/leaksapplepro_airpods_2021-100881009-large.jpg\"></a><small><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1369642089387024386\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></small></figure><p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3385527/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">current AirPods</a> were released in 2019, a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3151535/airpods-review-they-sound-great-but-siri-holds-them-back.html\">original AirPods</a> that shipped in 2016.

The rumors also included AirPods 3, but if Kuo and l0vetodream’s reports hold true, this could be a smaller event than expected—or there are product updates that haven’t leaked.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
