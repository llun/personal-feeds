{"title":"Mathieu van der Poel to skip Omloop in favour of Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9274/mathieu-van-der-poel-to-skip-omloop-in-favour-of-kuurne-brussels-kuurne","date":1614267696000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> is set to skip Omloop Het Nieuwsblad on Saturday but will take the start line of Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne the following day.</p><p>The Dutchman was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9259/van-der-poels-alpecin-fenix-withdraw-from-uae-tour-due-to-covid-positive\">recently forced to leave the UAE Tour</a>, where he was leading after winning the first stage, after a member of his Alpecin-Fenix team's support staff tested positive for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/coronavirus\">coronavirus</a>.</p><p>'Mathieu van der Poel, who won the opening stage at the UAE Tour last week, will ride Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne on Sunday,' Alpecin-Fenix said in a statement today.</p><p>'The team management and coaching staff opted for this race for the Dutch champion – and not for Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, which is considered tougher – mainly because he’s only had one day of racing and Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne fits better in his training build up towards the other <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/cycling-spring-classics\">Spring Classics</a>.'</p><p>Van der Poel, who is widely tipped to come away with a raft of wins across the Classics and the wider season, should be a beneficial addition to the race as his attacking style rarely fails to entertain.</p><p>'I will be at the start of Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne with a good feeling after my stage victory in the UAE Tour,' his team quote him as saying. 'It’s good to have an extra day of racing before I leave for Italy, but I’ll also start with confidence and expect a nice race.</p><p>'Obviously, I would have liked to finish the UAE Tour, especially because we had a nice lead in the GC with our group after the opening stage, and a good final classification could have been in the making. But I’m also happy that we got home fairly quickly and without any problems, and that our spring campaign hasn’t been jeopardised.</p><p>'We can be ambitious for Kuurne. I think I can be of added value to Tim [Merlier], who for me is one of the fastest guys in the peloton, and at the same time we can bet on two horses.'</p></div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"dab01922de1c737f1bf6bea82d7865c4cfdeb555bb701c6dedefdbc92372dad2","category":"Cycling"}
