It’s been stuck there so long that other ships are starting to turn south around the horn of Africa.</p><p>Our friends over at Pinkbike rang up some industry contacts to see if <a href=\"https://www.pinkbike.com/news/canyon--orange-comment-on-delays-caused-by-blocked-suez-canal.html\">any bike shipments currently sit on the deck of the Ever Given</a>.</p><p>The answer? Yep.</p><p>“Yes, one of our shipments is loaded on the “Ever Given” and there are several shipments blocked on vessels which cannot pass the Suez canal,” a representative of Canyon told Pinkbike. “This will cause a delayed ETD in Rotterdam and will lead to a bottleneck in the harbour. Currently they have no ships to unload.”</p><p>The whole situation is making for some great memes, at least.</p><p>For the full story, including a broader discussion of the industry’s current availability crisis, <a href=\"https://www.pinkbike.com/news/canyon--orange-comment-on-delays-caused-by-blocked-suez-canal.html\">head over to Pinkbike</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"bbb3a474612b75d26ff40d4d1d487db6b52e0aa31a31639d35eb63042baf746b","category":"Cycling"}
