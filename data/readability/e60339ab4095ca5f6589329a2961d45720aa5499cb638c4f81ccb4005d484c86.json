{"title":"Pros Playlist: Oss, The punk of peloton","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/pros-playlist-oss-the-punk-of-peloton/","date":1618426707000,"content":"<div><div><p>Welcome to the second episode of what I hope will be an ongoing series, The Pain Cave PlayList. If you didn’t see episode one with Bora-Hansgorth’s Lukas Postlburger, then you won’t be clued up on what all this is about. Quite simply, it’s an excuse to chat music on a cycling website. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t enjoy music, it’s something that reaches everyone in some shape or form, some more than others, and there the people I’m hunting down in the world of cycling. As for the musicians, I’m reversing it, hunting down the people who work within the music industry who have a passion for cycling. I’ve got an absolute storming guest for episode three already filmed and in the bag. I’ll then nudge them in the right direction to build us a playlist, maybe even a playlist that would be ideal for riding. </p><p>In that first episode a few weeks back, I’ll be honest, Lukas Postleburger disappointed; he’s Austrian, has a background in classical music, but surprisingly didn’t include <em>any Schubert. </em> I suppose it’s not the stuff to get you fired up for a race or training. The rest of his playlist was “banging”, something which would get the blood flowing when warming up for a race or making the legs hurt on a Zwift route.</p><p>Luka’s was the first person who recommended this weeks guest. Daniel Oss, Twitter and the youtube comments also requested I hunt down and chat with Mr Oss. It turns out he’s a bit of a punk. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CORVOS_00032491-085-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Oss plays bass in his spare time, and claims he’s the bass of the Bora-Hansgorh team too. Who are we to argue.</figcaption></figure><p>Daniel’s playlist is a world away from Lukas’ “twiddly, tweet tweet” electronica; instead, it’s a bit rawer, a bit agro, more informed by his days as a teenager wanting to escape from his small home town in Italy. </p><p>We delve into a few tracks that he’d happily have on repeat; this week, I pose the question if Spotify didn’t exist, if MP3’s weren’t a thing if we were back before the iPod, what four albums would he have in his bag? for a three-week tour. We also chat about not how he sees himself as the bass guitar of the Bora-hansgorth team. An instrument he’s also mastered. </p><p><strong>Daniel’s Pain Cave Playlist</strong>:</p><figure></figure></div></div>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e60339ab4095ca5f6589329a2961d45720aa5499cb638c4f81ccb4005d484c86","category":"Cycling"}
