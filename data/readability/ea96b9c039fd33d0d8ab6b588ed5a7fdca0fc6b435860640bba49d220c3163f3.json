Of course, the 100 million Neil Cybart claims there is his estimate but it’s an educated estimate. The real number is somewhere in the 100 million ballpark.</p><p>Let’s call the ballpark Flop Field.</p><p>Not everything Apple makes is a breakout hit. The Touch Bar had some promise but, unlike the Watch, Apple’s failed to improve it much in the four years since it launched. The HomePod is okay but not a real measurable hit. The Apple TV seem to be <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/02/apple-tv-if-we-only-had-a-wheelbarrow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the drunk uncle of Apple’s product offering</a>, wandering aimlessly through the electronics area of Costco yelling for his wife.

And, as Cybart notes, it’s only getting more popular.</p><blockquote><p>The 30 million new people that began wearing an Apple Watch in 2020 nearly exceeded the number of new Apple Watch wearers in 2015, 2016, and 2017 combined.</p></blockquote><p>It’s now Apple’s fourth largest installed base after the iPhone, iPad and Mac. It was never going to sell in the same numbers as the iPhone, if only because it relies on <em>having</em> an iPhone in the first place to use it. Cybart estimates that at the end of 2020, about 10 percent of iPhone owners also owned a Apple Watch.</p><p>The Apple Watch is popular because Apple had a vision for what it should be: a high end health, fitness and communication device. We may not have seen the vision when it was first released, but the company did and it executed on it, driving it forward with each release.</p><p>The Macalope’s not naive enough to think that pundits are checking wine blogs to check on what whites go with crow, but it’d be nice if they were.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
