An ad this week, for example, points out the gaming capabilities of Intel chips. Intel mentions Rocket League, a game that is not available on Apple's platform.</p><p>An ad from last week highlighted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/11/intel-mocks-apple-in-new-campaign-highlighting-things-users-cant-do-on-a-m1-mac/\">9to5Mac</a></em> points out the lack of a touchscreen on Apple's Macs. \"Only a PC offers tablet mode, touch screen and stylus capabilities in a single device,\" reads Intel's tweet.</p><div><blockquote><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Only a PC offers tablet mode, touch screen and stylus capabilities in a single device. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPC</a> — Intel (@intel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1356633480776531968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Intel's tweets link to a video from YouTuber Jon Rettinger demoing laptops equipped with Intel chips and comparing them to the ‌M1‌ Macs.</p><p>Apple's ‌M1‌ chips received a lot of attention at launch due to their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-macbook-pro-vs-intel-macbook-pro/\">impressive speed and power efficiency</a>, which is not matched by Intel chips. Earlier this week, Intel launched a series of \"carefully crafted\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/06/intel-11th-gen-vs-apple-m1-chip-benchmarks/\">benchmarks</a> designed to prove that Intel's 11th-generation processors are better than the ‌M1‌ chips, but the benchmarks were designed to favor Intel machines and were described by Apple columnist Jason Snell as \"M1-unfriendly.\"</p><p>Intel's anti-Apple advertising is likely just getting started, as Apple plans to be largely free of Intel chips within a two year period. Apple is transitioning its entire Mac lineup to Apple silicon chips, with the MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> set to be refreshed next.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyer’s Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
