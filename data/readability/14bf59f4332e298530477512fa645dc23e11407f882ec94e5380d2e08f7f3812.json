However, that requires brands and designers working for these brands to decide what those personalizations will be. Typically, it takes the form of personalized recommendations or messaging based on the visitors’ or customers’ histories with the website.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/57116d1b-1461-47cf-8b3e-0e802466492b/shaping-design-your-ui-by-you.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"\"></a><figcaption>The web that’s customized to customer’s needs and preferences.

That goes not only for adjusting the dark/light mode, color themes, size and spacing of the text, reduced motion and accessibility in general.</p><p>Interfaces would change based on available connectivity (should we really load web fonts and parallax on a slow 3G connection?), device memory, but also personal interests and product preferences. And as a result, we are looking at interfaces that are becoming <strong>singular to each customer</strong>, reflecting their taste, style, and identity. As designers, we’ll go beyond designing design systems, and create a vibrant spectrum of experiences, one particular kind for every customer.</p><h3 id=\"design-activism-brands-take-a-stand\">Design Activism: Brands Take a Stand</h3><p>When a brand stays doesn’t speak out in support of a cause, it actually supports the status quo. So it’s not surprising that many customers choose to support brands and products that they connect with way beyond the quality of the product they are serving. The product is always embodied by the people interacting with it, and as these people have <strong>values and principles</strong>, they need to find representation in the brand’s voice as well to feel connected to the product.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2dc6554f-fb43-4186-9dd0-d143ae58b8d0/5-web-design-trends-report-2021.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"Shaping Design’s trends report Trend #4: Design Activism\"></a><figcaption>Companies that don’t speak up support the status quo.

(Image source: <a href=\"http://editorx.com/shaping-design/web-design-trends/2021\">Shaping Design Trends Report</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>And when brands decide to publicly take a stand for something they believe in, they need to speak with <strong>bold, iconic visuals</strong> that also stand up for what they represent. It became very clear last year with protest graphics and campaigns calling for racial, environmental, and political justice. In 2021, social activism won’t quietly sit behind a single page about the company’s do-goodism or values. Instead, we should be expecting more brands, agencies, and designers to boldly declare what they stand for.</p><p>As a result, we might see more <strong>unique and bespoke design</strong> assets, such as custom-made typefaces, illustrations, and icon sets. Designers will have to react quickly to the ongoing events, creating and integrating bold visuals that send an unequivocal message of solidarity and support.</p><p>We should also see more <strong>diverse and inclusive voices</strong> and messages in illustrations, language, and promotional messages, along with more campaigns supported and enabled by brands, and designers presenting them.</p><h3 id=\"sensitivity-and-optimistic-voice\">Sensitivity and Optimistic Voice</h3><p>With the world going together through a difficult and isolated time, for many of us staying optimistic about the future is the only way to deal with the situation. Last year can be seen as a <strong>global reset</strong> of pretty much everything we’ve been used to in our lives; a time that forced us to rethink our values, principles, views and connections with people we care about.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9c96127-4c41-4772-b767-fdc92ed9c67c/6-web-design-trends-report-2021.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"\"></a><figcaption>We all are tired of pessimism and isolation, and seek optimism in our families and our work. That’s what we should be expecting in design, too.</figcaption></figure><p>So it shouldn’t be surprising that we should be expecting a calm, uplifting and playful tone transported in messages all over the web. Colors and typography will feel lighter, brighter, hopeful and even dreamier. We should see more <strong>authentic, honest and personal attributes</strong> in digital design, with people not being afraid to show what matters to them and how they really see themselves. As we all are in the same boat, interfaces and brands should become more sensitive and caring, perhaps with a dose of humor and focus on emotional wellness.</p><p>For designers, that would mean energetic illustrations and color palettes, accessible experiences, a friendly, supportive tone and a positive, uplifting message —&nbsp;all of them together fostering a sense of optimism and wellbeing.</p><p>Also, designers are reclaiming technology and putting humans first. We’ll be looking at more <strong>inclusive and safe web spaces</strong> for truthful conversations. That also means a greater emphasis on tracking, privacy, data protection and the carbon footprint of online platforms, to help make the Web a better, safer environment for both people and the planet.</p><h3 id=\"retro-touch\">Retro Touch</h3><p>To say that we’re fully entrenched in the digital world would be an understatement. But surely it isn’t easy to abandon the digital world when the Web makes our lives and our work so much easier (at times). Yet when we look back today, we often miss the times when things used to be just a little bit different. There, we aren’t just going a few years back, but even beyond that, with designers using everything <strong>from floppy disks to vintage stamps</strong> to bring retro touch to their designs.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8672014d-c8f7-4a71-9820-8b4ed8750ece/2-web-design-trends-report-2021.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"\"></a><figcaption>We are making a full circle again.

But in the world which is remarkably similar, being different brings the spotlight and attention. So brands that want to stand out, need to stand out in their digital experiences as well.
