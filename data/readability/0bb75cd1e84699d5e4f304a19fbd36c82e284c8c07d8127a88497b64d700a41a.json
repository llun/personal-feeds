According to the brand that means air moves across the head 18% faster than with the original Prevail II.</p><p>Don't fret though, there is still something holding the shell together. Those bridges have been replaced by ropes made from aramid, which is a heat-resistant fibre that is also low-stretch and high strength.</p>&nbsp;<p>Alongside that, it retains the Specialized-exclusive Mips SL system, providing 10-15mm of rotation for extra impact protection with a new Mips pad kit with ripstop backing to further improve breathability and comfort.</p><p>It also still comes with the ANGi crash sensor that, after setting up the app, detects a crash and alerts emergency contacts of your location if you don't respond in time. Its GPS also means you can connect it to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/strava\">Strava</a> and track your rides via the lid.</p><p>Importantly, it is still as safe as they come, having been given a five-star rating by Virginia Tech's independent measure that identifies helmets which best reduce the risk of concussion.</p>&nbsp;<h3>Colours and price</h3><p>As expected with a WorldTour standard helmet, the Prevail II Vent will set you back a fair wedge of Â£240, marginally more than its less ventilated counterpart.</p><p>It is available in four colourways: metallic white and silver; matte and gloss black; gloss sand and dopio (cream and brown to colour traditionalists); and matte maroon and gloss black.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/gb/en/s-works-prevail-ii-vent-with-angi/p/187323?color=320645-187323&amp;searchText=60921-1102\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Specialized S-Works Prevail II Vent with ANGi now</strong></em></a></p></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"0bb75cd1e84699d5e4f304a19fbd36c82e284c8c07d8127a88497b64d700a41a","category":"Cycling"}
