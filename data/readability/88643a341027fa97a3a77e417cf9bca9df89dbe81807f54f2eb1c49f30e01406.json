The feature delays charging the battery past 80% when it predicts the user will be connected to power for an extended period of time, and aims to charge the battery before they unplug from power, according to Apple.</p><p>Optimized Battery Charging can be toggled on or off in System Preferences &gt; Battery &gt; Battery on both Intel-based and M1-based Macs, but there are certain other battery health management features that cannot be disabled on M1-based Macs.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
