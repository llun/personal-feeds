From classy La Vie Claire kit to this multi-coloured monstrosity, possibly inspired by motorway chevrons. Note the young Laurent Jalabert on the far left, making his professional debut; Marc Madiot and Jeff Bernard also raced for them.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/worldtour-cycling-team-jerseys-2021\"><em><strong>Related –&nbsp;WorldTour Cycling Team Kits 2021: The Best, The Worst and The Bravest</strong></em></a></p><h4>Castorama (1990-95) </h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Ofs_Castorama_1991_01_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611340466\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In making their professional cyclists’ kit mirror that of the DIY store employees, sartorial shame was undeservedly heaped on the likes of Laurent Fignon (pictured), Jacky Durand and Laurent Brochard.&nbsp;</p><h4>Tonton Tapis (1991)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/1228994615ROCHE-Stephen-10_5a59f078-f77a-4fe8-a1d2-2472a40c4225_600x600.jpg?v=1611340555\" alt=\"\"></p><p>So nearly a classy Juventus-style strip for this team, sponsored by an interior design company. But then an upholstery-laden Belgian, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Graeme Souness, goes and spoils it all. That year, Stephen Roche was off-colour in more ways than one.&nbsp;</p><div><form novalidate=\"\" isembed=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div><div component=\"[object Object]\" alignment=\"center\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><img imageratio=\"0.008333333333333333\" src=\"https://d3k81ch9hvuctc.cloudfront.net/company/JQVLkV/images/92cf782c-a79d-4080-a0a0-9b006716be2d.png\" tabindex=\"-1\"></p></div><div data-gramm=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" component=\"[object Object]\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><span>Did you notice there is no advertising on Rouleur.cc?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While it's free to read our content, it isn't free to produce it.

This was the beginning of a long history of fashion crimes led by directeur sportif Vincent Lavenu (centre). Chazal were the early incarnation of current brown-short and confetti-jersey combiners Ag2r La Mondiale. Some teams never learn.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/desire-journal/the-best-merino-wool-cycling-jerseys\"><em><strong>Related – The Best Merino Wool jerseys</strong></em></a></p><h4>Polti (1994-1997)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/OFS_Gianni_Bugno_1994_03_fa1f7741-730e-4698-a6e6-e0f70d736089_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611340770\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The mid-90s were a halcyon time for god-awful garments, with Aki, Carrera and Chazal helping to turn the peloton into a hallucinogenic eyesore. This yellow-and-green outfit from Polti was prominent, with Djamolidine Abdoujaparov and Gianni Bugno (above, taking the 1994 Tour of Flanders by the narrowest of margins) winning big races, and arguably the worst of a bad bunch.</p><h4>Le Groupement (1995)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/legroupement_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611340799\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The French squad had a get-up that looked like the result of someone throwing paint at a wall and seeing if it stuck – an apt way of describing their financial dealings. Backed by a pyramid selling company (what could possibly go wrong there?), the team crumbled halfway through the season, leaving Rouleur columnist&nbsp;Phillipa York (pictured) and world champion Luc Leblanc among those out of a job.&nbsp;</p><h4>Astana (2006)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Astana2006_7773a698-09fe-443f-ac2e-443d0ae78c11_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611340864\" alt=\"\"></p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><p>Photo: Phil O’Connor</p><p>Their current kit is no great shakes, but they’ve toned it down considerably from this original in-your-face shade of cyan. When Astana riders wore bright blue leg and arm warmers, it brought to mind romper-suited toddlers on pushbikes.</p><h4>Predictor-Lotto (2007)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/OFS_Stage-1_2007_04_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611341093\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Why go pink or red when you can have salmon, the worst of both worlds? “That colour was probably my least favourable,” Cadel Evans said in a recent interview. Predictor flogged pregnancy test kits, making it a thoroughly naff combination.&nbsp;</p><h4>Footon-Servetto (2010)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Footon2010_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611341132\" alt=\"\"></p><p>They’ve left an indelible footprint on the sport. In the next century, when far superior teams and champions have long since been forgotten, Footon-Servetto will still be mentioned in cycling circles: not for their lacklustre, last place WorldTour finish, but as a tan-coloured exemplar for how not to do cycling kit.</p><h4>Neri Sottoli (2014)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Ofs_Neri_Sottoli_2014_01_e3723f60-60cf-468a-b80f-1136a51f26c5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611341169\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Our eyes! After the Rabottini and Santambrogio doping positives, if only the Italian team’s future could be as bright as their jersey.</p><h4>Phonak (2002-2006)</h4><p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/phonak_1024x1024.jpg?v=1611341197\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It was gruelling whittling it down to just ten terrible kits. Dishonourable mentions also go to Transmallorca (1978), Joker (1987), Riso Scotti (1999), Acqua e Sapone (2002), Phonak (above), Team Coast (2003), Rock Racing (2009) and Team LPR (2009).</p></div></div>","author":"Miles Baker-Clarke","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"95eedb23d1e8a121b09d43f483fd5e3ab94967509fd403fa8935d6563cd7cd18","category":"Cycling"}
