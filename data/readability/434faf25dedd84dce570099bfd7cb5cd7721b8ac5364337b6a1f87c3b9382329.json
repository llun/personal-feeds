Up top a new integrated display feeds back essential ride information at a glance.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pureelectric.com/products/orbea-gain-m10-19-hybrid-electric-bike\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>See more on the Orbea Gain M10i e-bike at Pure Electric now</em></strong></a></p><p>Those algorithms have got immensely good at optimising output too. With the battery as sleek and hidden as it is, it’s right to assume it’s on the small side, but thanks to the Enough Energy concept, the Gain will deliver just the right amount of power, never throwing too much behind your effort and thus conserving juice for when it’s really needed. Over long distances that will really be appreciated.</p><div id=\"file-43484\"><p><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/02/orbea_gain_m10i_e-bike_review_2.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"3000\" alt=\"\"></p></div><p>The bike’s new geometry provides a relaxed, intuitive cornering feel with a lower bottom bracket and shorter chainstays. Tucked between those are 700x30 tubeless tyres which will sail over the roads, though should you wish to explore the single chainring Gain specs will allow tyres of 700x40.</p><p>If your goal is to spend all weekend in the saddle you can add a range extender to any bike carrying the Ebikemotion X35 system. In the case of the Gain, this charges the battery, adding an extra 208Wh to the existing 248Wh built in, equating to 450Wh and a 70% boost. To mount this system you’ll simply need to put one of the frame’s bottle cage mounts to use.</p><p>If you’re planning to spend big, Orbea has the customer journey down to a fine art and has added the ability to configure your components, with its MyO led guidance which you can find on its website.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pureelectric.com/products/orbea-gain-m10-19-hybrid-electric-bike\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>See more on the Orbea Gain M10i e-bike at Pure Electric now</em></strong></a></p><p>This custom build platform enables you to switch out wheelsets, gearing and other components ahead of delivery to your local partner store where it will be given a final check before you hit the road or trail.</p><h3>Orbea Gain M10i specs</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Frame material</td><td>Carbon</td></tr><tr><td>Motor</td><td>Ebikemotion X35 Plus</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Ebikemotion 36V/6.9A 248Wh Ant+</td></tr><tr><td>Gearing</td><td>Shimano Dura-Ace 11-speed</td></tr><tr><td>Saddle</td><td>Fizik Antares</td></tr><tr><td>Wheels</td><td>OC2 Carbon Tubeless Ready</td></tr><tr><td>Tyres</td><td>Schwalbe ONE 700x30 Tubeless</td></tr><tr><td>Contact</td><td><a href=\"http://www.orbea.com/\" target=\"_blank\">orbea.com</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"434faf25dedd84dce570099bfd7cb5cd7721b8ac5364337b6a1f87c3b9382329","category":"Cycling"}
