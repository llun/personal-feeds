Fortunately, the 32-year-old Belgian remounted and was able to continue in the race.</p><p>The incident occurred with around 12 km to go on the day as a reduced peloton was making its way up the San Giacomo finishing climb. Serry was at the very back of the group and slowing down as the BikeExchange car approached.</p><p>Someone in the passenger seat of the BikeExchange vehicle appeared to exchange an item with someone in another vehicle, and then, moments later, the BikeExchange car collided with the back of Serry’s bike.</p><p>The impact sent Serry to the ground immediately. The BikeExchange driver quickly stopped the car behind the Deceuninck-QuickStep rider, who stayed on the ground for a few moments before getting up.
