{"title":"Tadej Pogacar will be a UAE Team Emirates rider until 2026","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9291/tadej-pogacar-will-be-a-uae-team-emirates-rider-until-2026","date":1614678960000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>Securing your future as a professional cyclist can sometimes seem nigh-on impossible. Unless you are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tour de France defending champion Tadej Pogacar</a>, in&nbsp;which case you will have just signed a five-year contract extension.</p><p>The talented 22-year-old has been shown a huge vote of confidence by the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE Team Emirates</a> team, who have extended the rider's contract through to 2026, believed to be the longest current deal in the WorldTour.</p><p>While no figures were attached to how much the Slovenian would be earning, due to his Tour victory in 2020 and recent win at the home UAE Tour, we expect Pogacar to be among the sport's top earners. Just look to new teammate Marc Hirschi who signed on a deal reported to be worth €1 million per season.</p><p>Pogacar's five-year contract extension is almost an unprecedented act in the world of cycling. With the future of teams, even those with the most financial might, seemingly always on a cliff edge, even the top riders are usually bound to contracts of three years or less.</p><p>The only recent exceptions to those rules have been <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/egan-bernal\">Egan Bernal</a>'s five-year deal with Ineos Grenadiers and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/chris-froome\">Chris Froome</a>'s five-year contract at Israel Start-Up Nation.</p><p>The almost-unheard of extension to Pogacar's contract is well-deserved and, naturally, the Slovenian is grateful for both the vote of confidence and most likely the healthy nature of his current bank balance.</p><p>'The team shows a lot of trust and confidence in me which I am thankful for, and I work hard to show that when I’m racing alongside my teammates,' said Pogacar.</p><p>'I hope we can have many more successful seasons together in the years ahead.'</p><p>For team principal Mauro Gianetti, it is clear that this long contract deal is worth it as Pogacar is seen as both the present and future of the team's successes.</p><p>'We are happy to announce the further extension of Tadej’s contract with us. He strongly believes in our project as we do in his abilities. It is already the third time we’ve extended his contract which shows his commitment to the project we are building here at UAE.</p><p>'We are creating a real group, united, with an atmosphere that I don’t remember in all my years in cycling. I am particularly proud of this.'</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"defb542ded4509cc6f9c610abaf93f4bd77860f4cc64bd1b35ad8f2fb051561d","category":"Cycling"}
