On Tuesday afternoon, the USPS awarded a 10-year, $485-million contract to Oshkosh Defenseâ€”better known for armored vehiclesâ€”to deliver between 50,000 and 165,000 Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, with the first trucks due on the road in 2023.</p><p>Neither the USPS nor Oshkosh is ready to share in-depth specs for the NGDV; Oshkosh still has to finalize the design, according to the press release. We do know that the new fleet will be made of a mix of powertrains. Some will be battery electric, but others will use \"fuel-efficient internal combustion engines,\" with the ability to be retrofitted \"to keep pace with advances in electric vehicle technology.\"</p><p>The rendered images certainly show a uniquely styled vehicle. The combination of an extremely low hood and very tall windshield gives it more than a little resemblance to a Pixar creation, but the payoff for this anatine look should be excellent forward visibility. Luckily for future postal workers, air conditioning is standard-issue, so they shouldn't get too hot due to that expanse of glass trapping the Sun's heat.</p><p>More attention appears to have been paid to driver and pedestrian safety than with the USPS' current&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trucks.com/2019/10/21/post-office-fiddles-mail-trucks-burn/\">fire-prone Grumman LLV trucks</a>. There are airbags, as well as a camera- and sensor-enabled suite of driver assists like automatic emergency braking.</p><p>Many had hoped that the USPS was going to choose an <a href=\"https://www.trucks.com/2017/10/09/spy-shots-postal-service-workhorse-electric-mail-truck/\">all-electric design for its next truck</a>, particularly since President Joe Biden just <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/biden-vows-to-electrify-the-federal-governments-600000-vehicle-fleet/\">vowed to electrify the federal government's vehicle fleet</a>.</p><p><em>Listing image by USPS</em></p></div></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
