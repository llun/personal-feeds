That same mentality has morphed into my adult life for better or worse, and when I started my journey into the world of cycling I felt real friction. I got into cycling, specifically racing road and cross when I was in college. I remember seeing and learning from my peers all of these ways to be an athlete. Eat this, do this, don’t do this. And for years I subscribed to that; I wore what I was supposed to wear, I limited what I ate, I trained, I raced and I wasn’t really having that much fun.</em></p><p><em>So I quit.”</em></p><p>Head to <a href=\"https://www.gravelle.life/posts/pov-go-your-own-way\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grav.elle</a> to read the full story.</p></div><nav><h4>Related</h4></nav></article></section></div>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"75f841cdc668935b925292b09b77881cdcb50a9a64933e4ec75b031b2e66b3d0","category":"Cycling"}
