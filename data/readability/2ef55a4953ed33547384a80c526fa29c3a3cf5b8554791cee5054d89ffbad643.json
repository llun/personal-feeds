I was riding the local Park City trail system and coming down the CMG trail at about 20 mph when this moose jumped onto the trail in front of me running. About 300 feet later it stopped at a trail intersection, blocking the one option to continue down. After confirming that there wasn’t a second moose behind me, I was able to grab a few photos while I waited 10 minutes for the local trail traffic&nbsp;to move along.”</p><p>**<a href=\"https://www.wildawareutah.org/wildlife/moose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Know what to do</a> if you encounter a moose on the trail.</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
