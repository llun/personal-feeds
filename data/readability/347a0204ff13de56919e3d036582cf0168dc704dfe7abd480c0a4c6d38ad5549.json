Overall, Apple shipped more than 3.2 million ‌‌iPhone‌‌ units in India in 2020, up 60% year-on-year.</p><p>The results follow several recent moves by Apple in the country, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/apple-online-store-india-launch/\">launch</a> of a regional online store in September 2020 and a Diwali promotion in October that offered free <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> with every ‌‌iPhone 11‌‌ purchase.</p><p>Apple has historically struggled to be competitive in what is the world's second largest smartphone market, in part due to the premium price tags of its ‌‌iPhone‌‌ models versus the low cost of rival handsets from the likes of Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo that have swamped the market.</p><p>However, Apple has taken advantage of the Indian government's Made in India initiative to increase its regional manufacturing base, which has allowed it to save import duty costs and pass on the savings to customers by reducing prices on older generation ‌‌iPhone‌‌ models.</p><p>Apple supplier Wistron recently began trial production of the ‌‌‌iPhone 12‌‌‌ at a new facility near Bengaluru, with full production set to begin soon. The ‌‌‌iPhone 12‌‌‌ will be the seventh ‌‌iPhone‌‌ model to be manufactured in India, but the first high-end device to do so.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/apple-watch-series-7-breakthrough-health-feature/\">Apple Watch Series 7 to Gain Breakthrough New Health Feature</a></h3><p>Apple is reportedly planning to bring a new, first-of-its-kind health technology to the Apple Watch Series 7, in what could be a breakthrough for managing conditions such as diabetes more easily.
