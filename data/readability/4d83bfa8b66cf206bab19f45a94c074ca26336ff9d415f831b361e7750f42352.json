{"title":"Sidi’s limited edition Sixty road shoes are a riot of colour","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/sidis-limited-edition-sixty-road-shoes-are-a-riot-of-colour/","date":1616454900000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>Founded in 1960, Sidi has been making high-end, Euro-styled shoes since cycling was still in black and white –&nbsp;a theme that has tended to follow in the Italian company’s oft-monochromatic footwear.</p><p>With the brand’s limited-release Sixty road shoes, however, Sidi has burst into glorious colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from the astounding colour-scheme –&nbsp;a Rorschachian ink-blot motif in overlapping shades of red, blue and yellow – the shoes are otherwise identical to the standard Sixty. That means that they’re made in Italy, and feature Sidi’s proprietary symmetrical Tecno-4 fastening mechanism, along with a super tech-y velcro strap.&nbsp;</p><p>The sole is constructed of carbon fibre, finished in a 3k weave “oriented at opposing angles that maximize stiffness while allowing for a small degree of controlled flex in the toe area,” which is something of a departure from the propensity of rival manufacturers to dial up the stiffness of their shoes like a Spinal Tap amp (only, it now goes up to 15). Weight is around 260 g per piece in a size 42.5.</p><p>All of the pads on the soles are replaceable, which is a promising sign for a long lifespan. And given they’re unlikely to be a screaming bargain, you’d certainly hope to get a few years out of them. While details of availability and pricing are light-on at the moment, the standard Sixtys come in at around €350 (~US$420 / AU$540).&nbsp;</p><p>For more, head over to <a href=\"https://www.sidi.com/en/content/29-limited-edition-sixty-multicolor\">Sidi.com.</a></p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4d83bfa8b66cf206bab19f45a94c074ca26336ff9d415f831b361e7750f42352","category":"Cycling"}
