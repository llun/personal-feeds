Designed with speed in mind, Schwalbe says the G-One R is good for use on light terrain, gravel roads, and asphalt.</p><p>Schwalbe has constructed the new tyre using its Super Race carcass. This casing is said to offer a smooth ride with low rolling resistance with high levels of road and off-road grip. Schwalbe adds its V-Guard puncture protection layer under the tread to maintain a level of air holding and durability required for gravel riding.</p><p>Notably, the tyre features a closely packed tread pattern that offers a “Boomerang profile.” Where Schwalbe previous gravel tyres have traditionally offered a shallow depth tread, these are noticeably more raised.</p><p>The new tyres also come with Schwalbe’s Tubeless Easy stamp and are available in 700 x 40 and 45 mm options. No word of 650B options, but that’s expected given the smaller wheel size isn’t so common in gravel racing.</p><p>James Huang has a pair in for review, keep an eye out for that in the months to come.</p></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"41f2d0575fe84ed301d7c4e517f4bc7808dc7ff4196430b031c6aade0a75e87f","category":"Cycling"}
