He quickly sailed passed the last survivors of the early breakaway and then continued on alone, going up and over the top of the climb solo with a 45-second gap back to the next rider on the road, Damiano Caruso.</p><p>Bernal held on through the descent into the finish in Cortina d’Ampezzo to secure the stage victory. Romain Bardet linked up with Caruso on the descent and the duo arrived 27 seconds after Bernal, with Caruso nabbing runner-up honors on the day and Bardet taking third.</p><p>The GC riders continued to arrive in small groups or alone after that. Giulio Ciccone was the next rider to finish, 1:18 back on Bernal and just ahead of Hugh Carthy and João Almeida, with Aleksandr Vlasov then finishing seventh, 2:11 back. Bernal now leads the general classification with a gap of 2:24 over Caruso.</p><div><div><p>Giro d'Italia (2.UWT) <span>Sacile → Cortina d'Ampezzo</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ca/egan-bernal-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8cb7cf6e56c9f93d184dd87066e8788f7b2b0a4334dcd9475c2f704fe8fdd54f","category":"Cycling"}
