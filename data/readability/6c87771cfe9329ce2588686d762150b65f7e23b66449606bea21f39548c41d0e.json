At half off, this is one of the best prices we've seen on this official Apple accessory, and it's available to ship out today.</p><p>If you own an iPad Pro, there are also a few Smart Folio discounts, but none as steep as the iPad Air model. You can get the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smart-Folio-11-inch-iPad-Pro%2Fdp%2FB0863J6V4N%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1&amp;dtb=1\">11-inch iPad Pro Smart Folio</a> for $64.95 in Black, down from $79.00. The <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smart-Folio-iPad-12-9-inch%2Fdp%2FB0863GGLW6%2Fref%3Dsr_1_5&amp;dtb=1\">12.9-inch model</a> is at $83.88 in Black and Pink Sand, down from $99.00.<br></p><h2>Magic Keyboard</h2><p>The second sale is a popular ongoing discount on the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation%2Fdp%2FB0863BQJMS%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp&amp;dtb=1\">Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro</a> and fourth generation iPad Air. This accessory is priced at <strong>$199.00</strong> on Amazon, down from $299.00, remaining the best price we've ever seen.</p><p>Likewise, the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0863F794B&amp;dtb=1\">12.9-inch Magic Keyboard</a> is also still seeing a discounted price, but it's not as good as the smaller version of the accessory. It's available for <strong>$329.00</strong>, down from $349.00. We've seen this accessory marked down to about $315.00 in the past, but today's deal is far more common and one of the best around if you're in the market for the 12.9-inch option of the Magic Keyboard.<br></p><h2>AirPods</h2><p>In AirPods sales, Amazon has a few solid offers on the regular AirPods and AirPods with Wireless Charging Case. To start, you can get the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1&amp;dtb=1\">AirPods with Wired Charging Case</a> for <strong>$119.99</strong>, down from $159.00. The best price we've seen so far in 2021 is about $110 for this model, so Amazon's sale this week isn't too far off and still a decent deal.</p><p>If you want to invest in the wireless option, Amazon has the <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PYLT6DN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1&amp;dtb=1\">AirPods with Wireless Charging Case</a> at <strong>$149.99</strong>, down from $199.99. These aren't discounted as often as the cheaper pair, and although today's price isn't a lowest-ever deal, it's made for one of the first major discounts in 2021 on this model.</p><p>We track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.
