Yes… But mountain bike tires can vary hugely in their size, materials, durability, and, depending on those knobs, the type of terrain and riding style they’re designed to handle.</p><p>A properly chosen mountain bike tire can make a ride more comfortable, safer, and give you more traction on the trail. It can shave grams off of your total bike weight, or it can make you less prone to flat tires. Tires are quite literally the base of the bike, its connection to the ground — so the tires you use make a big difference to your ride quality.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know to understand how MTB tires work, the differences in construction and type, and how to choose the best mountain bike tire for your bike and riding style…</p><h3>What types of MTB tires are there?</h3><figure id=\"attachment_249271\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-249271\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg\" alt=\"2021 BH Lynx Race EVO XC bike, lightweight cross-country light trail mountain bike,&nbsp;climbing\" width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-297x178.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-800x480.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-120x72.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-768x461.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-696x418.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-1068x641.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-700x420.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-297x178.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-800x480.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-120x72.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-768x461.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-696x418.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-1068x641.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2021-BH-Lynx-Race-EVO-XC-bike_lightweight-cross-country-light-trail-mountain-bike_climbing-700x420.jpg 700w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-249271\">c.

They’re thinner and lighter than the other options, and will roll faster. They generally have smaller, lower, and/or fewer knobs, and distinct front- and rear-specific tires are common.</p><p>While lighter means faster, the weight savings come at the expense of protection. XC tires have fewer layers of puncture and cut protection, so they&nbsp;may not be the best choice for gnarly trails, though burlier tires for cross country bikes are available.

Moving up in travel, you have Trail bikes (120-140mm), Enduro (140-170mm), and All Mountain (160-180mm). The tires get bigger, tougher, and more aggressive as you move up that ladder, too.</p><p>Here, knobs are taller and start to get supporting trusses to hold up to higher speed, more aggressive cornering. Tire size and volume increase to offer more traction and support, and they add more protective layers to the casing. Some tires get dual rubber compounds to put more grip on the sides.</p><figure id=\"attachment_241650\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241650\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Canyon Sender CFR DH bike, lightweight full carbon World Cup downhill race mountain bike, photo by Ryan Finlay\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2021-Canyon-Sender-CFR-DH-bike_lightweight-full-carbon-World-Cup-downhill-race-mountain-bike_photo-by-Ryan-Finlay-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241650\">c.

There are also smaller ones for children’s bikes, ranging from 16 to 24 inches in diameter.</p><p>The second number is the width and can range from 1.9″ for ultralight race bikes (and kids’ bikes) to 5″ for fat bikes.</p><p>While the 26, 27.5 or 29-inch measurement is based on your wheel size, the tire width is determined in part by how much clearance you have between your fork or rear triangle and your tire, and by your personal preference. You’ll have a range of widths to choose from, depending on what you’re looking for in a tire. In general:</p><ul><li><strong>Cross Country:</strong> 1.9″ to 2.25″ width</li><li><strong>Trail / All-Mountain / Enduro:</strong> 2.25″ to 2.6″ width</li><li><strong>Downhill:</strong> 2.5″ – 2.8″ width</li><li><strong>Plus:</strong> 2.8″-3.0″ width</li><li><strong>Fat Bikes:</strong> 3.7″ to 5″ width</li></ul><p>Another major consideration is matching your tire width to the correct rim width.

Pirelli</figcaption></figure><p>The simple answer is “rubber.” But it’s a bit more complicated than that. We have <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/08/07/tire-tech-designing-an-xc-tire-from-the-ground-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a deep dive on tire construction right here</a>, but here’s the quick version:</p><p><strong>RUBBER:</strong> Every brand has their own unique rubber compounds designed to excel in different ways, and many disclose the durometer (aka “firmness”) of the rubber. Lower durometer numbers (40-60) are softer and have better the grip, but they’ll roll slower and wear out faster. Harder rubber (higher durometer, usually 60-72) provides lower rolling resistance so you can go faster, but won’t grip as well.</p><p>Higher end tires usually get dual compounds, putting a softer rubber on the side knobs for better cornering, and firmer rubber in the middle for faster rolling and better braking.</p><p><strong>CASING:</strong> Every tire has a casing that the rubber is applied to. It’s usually a woven nylon fabric. Cheaper tires have lower TPI casings, but most “performance” tires start at 60tpi and this is a great baseline because it’s both flexible and sturdy. More aggressive tires sometimes use two 60tpi casing layers to add more support and cut protection. The tradeoff is they’re less supple and can have a firm-feeling ride, although they’re also better able to handle lower tire pressures without getting squirmy.</p><p>Lighter-weight “race” tires can get 120tpi casings, which use thinner fibers to increase the thread count. They are very flexible and help the tire deform to match the terrain, so they feel amazing, but they’re expensive and not nearly as cut resistant.</p><p><strong>REINFORCEMENTS:</strong> In addition to the casings, some tires add reinforcements to further prevent sidewall cuts, punctures, and pinch flats. Look for a Kevlar or Aramid layer under the tread (puncture protection) or on the sidewall (cut resistance), or both.</p><p>An “Apex” layer is a small foam or rubber wedge layered between the casings by the tire’s bead. It adds a bit of sidewall support, but its main purpose is add a cushion between the sidewall and the rim to prevent snakebite punctures when you hit a sharp edge really hard.</p><p>All of these technologies work great, but they all add weight and cost. Knobbier, more aggressive tires pedal slowly and can really sap your energy on the climbs and flats. So, only buy as much tire as you really need.</p><h3>What about MTB tire beads?</h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pirelli-Scorpion-ebike-mountain-bike-MTB-eMTB-tires-actual-weight-size-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>You may notice that some tires in your local bike shop are sold neatly folded up in a cardboard wrap, while others are open to full size.</p><p>Cheaper tires use rigid wire beads because they’re easier to manufacturer and cost less.

As the name implies, tubeless tires don’t require tubes and instead use tape around the wheel’s inner rim to seal off the spoke holes. Sealant is poured into the tire and the tire is seated, usually using an air compressor or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/05/07/best-bike-pumps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a bike pump with a “booster” chamber</a> in order to add enough air quickly to get the tires to ‘sit’ on the rim of the wheel.</p><p>The sealant does exactly what you’d assume it would: Keeps the air sealed into your tire, even if you get a small puncture or you hit an obstacle hard and pinch your tire. This means you can run lower pressures for better comfort and traction, and you save the weight of the tube, too. However, they are harder to deal with if things do go awry and can be messy, so if you’re not much of a mechanic, you may want to stick to regular tubes while you build your skills.</p><h3>Is there a difference between tubeless and regular MTB tires?</h3><p>You can <em>attempt</em> to turn any mountain bike tire into a tubeless setup, but we wouldn’t recommend it unless both your tire and rim are labeled as ‘Tubeless Compatible’ or ‘Tubeless Ready’.</p><p>Fortunately, almost every modern mountain bike tire (especially ones you’d be upgrading to) are now tubeless-ready. And most modern mountain bike wheels use tubeless-ready rims, all of which are manufactured to meet size and diameter standards to ensure a safe, secure fit. As long as you’re buying a reputable, major brand of wheel/rim and tire, tubeless setup is easy and reliable, and will improve your ride quality.</p><h3>What do the different tire descriptions mean?</h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1107\" height=\"492\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565.jpg 1107w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-120x53.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-297x132.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-768x341.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-800x356.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-696x309.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-1068x475.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-945x420.jpg 945w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb20 src ng ngcb20 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565.jpg 1107w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-120x53.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-297x132.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-768x341.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-800x356.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-696x309.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-1068x475.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07153819/WTB-Vigilante-2-point-8-plus-tire-mtb-wet-weather-4-e1623094698565-945x420.jpg 945w\"></a></p><p>In addition to putting tires into the XC, trail or downhill categories, brands often categorize their tires by the conditions that the lugs are optimized for. As you look for a tire, think about the terrain you typically ride, and whether you prefer comfort or speed.</p><ul><li><strong>MUD:</strong> Pretty self-explanatory, but tires optimized for mud tend to have wider-spaced, spiky-shaped lugs so that mud doesn’t cake up between them and ruin your traction.</li><li><strong>SEMI-SLICK:</strong> If you’re a racer and often on non-technical trails, a semi-slick allows you to maximize speed with tightly placed, low-profile lugs.</li><li><strong>LOOSE:</strong> Lots of sand or small rocks that move around where you ride? Look for tires designed for loose riding.</li><li><strong>HARDPACK:</strong> Fast shredding on hard dirt or slickrock.</li><li><strong>ROCKY:</strong> Some tires are designed to be more puncture resistance and armored on the sides so that if you’re riding in an area with lots of sharp rock, you’ll be less likely to puncture.</li></ul><h3>How much should MTB tires cost?</h3><p>There’s a huge range of pricing when it comes to mountain bike tires. A decent tire can be as inexpensive as $30 per tire, but can easily climb up to over $100 per tire. The sweet spot is right around $50-70/tire when it comes to cost versus value for most riders.</p><h2>MTB Tire Buying Guides</h2><p>So, which type and brand should you buy?
