The day after that effort was quite ok and the day after that was a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/time-trial\">time-trial</a>. We had three easy days to recover so that should be more than enough.'</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2471/milan-san-remo-2021-who-is-going-to-win\">Despite being favourite</a> to take the win at the season's first Monument, Van der Poel admitted he doesn't really like the race. 'The first 150-200km is just riding in a bunch and trying not to fall asleep so it's not really my kind of racing,' he said.</p><p>'It's one of the most difficult to win because there's not a lot of places where you can force the race. Most of the time you have to wait until the Poggio, but it's difficult to really make a gap.'</p><p>In typical favourite fashion, Van der Poel, who beat eternal rival <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a> to the last Monument at the delayed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-of-flanders\">Tour of Flanders</a> last October, was quick to talk up his competitors, 'I think Michael Matthews was really good last year and he has a really fast sprint. He had a really good Paris-Nice as well so I think he will be a guy to watch.'</p><p>He also couldn't rule Van Aert out, 'I think Wout has a little bit of an advantage already in that he has won the race once so I think for him it's a bit easier. But it will be a new race and San Remo is quite an honest race so the strongest normally wins.'</p><p>If Van der Poel does win, he would replicate the feat of his late grandfather, Raymond Poulidor, almost exactly 60 years later.</p></div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"4a6c37fb5b4f2bba4f49201ce3062fadc8d6b579e5adbf8472e9a5cdea40863b","category":"Cycling"}
