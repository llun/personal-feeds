The owner of the land and the half-build villa was a foreigner, who had to cancel the whole project because they couldn’t get a permit for it. So it ended up being an attraction to visitors who often pass the area to go to the north side of&nbsp;the island.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
