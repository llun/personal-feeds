The latest video to capture our attention, from the heavily subscribed The Q channel, is five and a half minutes of a man fitting saw-wheels onto a budget mountain bike, and then riding it on a frozen lake.</p><p>Which sounds absolutely bonkers, I’ll grant you.</p><p>Although the video is brief, it is jam-packed with instructive information for how to fit saw-wheels onto your <em>own</em> budget mountain bike, if you feel so inclined. Lulled by a soothing soundtrack, we get to see how to take the wheel apart, remove the loose ball-bearings, repurpose the hub, and finally, fettle a death-trap.</p><p>Then, we see Old Mate set off onto a frozen lake somewhere depressing enough that making a bike like this seems a productive use of time.</p><p>The video –&nbsp;“Epic Cycling on Ice” –&nbsp;has gained impressive traction over the five days since it was published, with more than 15 million views. Many of those viewers have found themselves imagining things:</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"data:image/image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAYEBAUEBAYFBQUGBgYHCQ4JCQgICRINDQoOFRIWFhUSFBQXGiEcFxgfGRQUHScdHyIjJSUlFhwpLCgkKyEkJST/2wBDAQYGBgkICREJCREkGBQYJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCT/wAARCAAJABADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQI/8QAHRAAAgICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDEQAhBDEzcf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDR6x3xXXWjsXXRxYqeVCEsBdmu8SPyn+tk8HkuB//Z\" data-src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comments.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comments.jpg 1280w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comments-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comments-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comments-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Comments-16x9.jpg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"><figcaption>This video has sparked some real soul-searching in the YouTube commentariat.</figcaption></figure><p>We imagined things too – like the head tube angle and toe-overlap of the Spirit “Number One” mountain bike that, thanks to this video, has become an unlikely internet icon.

He has sensible shoes. He knows his way around an angle-grinder. He seems to be making these modifications in an abandoned office. He is wearing <a href=\"https://www.vinted.fr/hommes/t-shirts-imprimes/285139373-t-shirt-mont-blanc-valley\">this t-shirt</a> that you can buy used from someone in France for €1, if you want to Shop The Look.</p><p>All of which is great, but leaves us some way short of truly knowing the man, the myth, the Epic Cyclist on Ice.</p><p>So, thwarted, I guess we’ll just hit repeat on another viewing and imagine him cutting through the ice with his silly invention, running over a mouse, cycling on a giant pizza, etcetera.</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"673\" src=\"data:image/image/png;base64,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\" data-src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm-1340x673.png\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm-1340x673.png 1340w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm-650x327.png 650w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm-190x95.png 190w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm-1080x543.png 1080w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm-16x8.png 16w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-1.41.56-pm.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\"></figure><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a2fa769d2a19e816937d58b8ee3f973a22a902691b3a548dcb720aa12e49f6ed","category":"Cycling"}
