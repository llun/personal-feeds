The Class 42 identification is <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/classifications/nice/nclpub/en/fr/?basic_numbers=show&amp;class_number=42&amp;explanatory_notes=show&amp;lang=en&amp;menulang=en&amp;mode=flat&amp;notion=&amp;pagination=no&amp;version=20210101\">listed</a> as including software as a service (SaaS), or a platform as a service (PaaS). For context, Microsoft Office 365, which is based on a monthly or yearly subscription, includes the same Class 42 listing for its suite of software.</p><p>Final Cut Pro is currently sold for $300 and is used widely by professional videographers, YouTubers, and content makers. Potentially changing the price and payment model into a monthly, or yearly subscription could entice even more customers to use the software. If Apple is planning the subscription route, it'll likely include more than simply the software itself.</p><p><img alt=\"6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b\" width=\"1106\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QA6vFW4kVJI19oIpa1g_mzAiZqk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QA6vFW4kVJI19oIpa1g_mzAiZqk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QA6vFW4kVJI19oIpa1g_mzAiZqk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/W80QyydoEinZ8Ccht1r4oZONQlU=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Y4I8JBJPb7FKVN8ZCWu_A7NXcgQ=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/4wmFghmizhDckwKeUSmqg_JeGLE=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"748px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QA6vFW4kVJI19oIpa1g_mzAiZqk=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/W80QyydoEinZ8Ccht1r4oZONQlU=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Y4I8JBJPb7FKVN8ZCWu_A7NXcgQ=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/4wmFghmizhDckwKeUSmqg_JeGLE=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg 2500w\"><br>With a subscription, Apple theoretically could offer subscribers access to original content, such as in-depth tutorials, walkthroughs, or exclusive videos/sessions with prominent video makers who use Final Cut Pro as part of their workflow.</p><p>Whether Apple takes the route is unknown, however, the pure nature of the updated trademark is rather telling.
