Pumping it up should remedy the issue. If your post has a sealed air cartridge, such as is found in the Rainier Dropper, or you have it charged properly and it drops while disconnected from the lever, that would be a good candidate to send it in for inspection. Be sure to check with the manufacturer before shipping it back.</p><p><strong>Is there any way of altering the progression of my dropper? I don’t like how it just slams straight to the bottom of its travel when I push the lever. A bit of resistance would help me fine tune my saddle height for technical climbing.</strong></p><p><strong>OneUp Components: </strong>Maxing out the pressure would increase the resistance when lowering and therefore make fine tuning the drop easier. That said, we typically find that riders want lower drop resistance, not higher.</p><figure id=\"attachment_224191\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-224191\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb.jpg\" alt=\"oneup dropper mtb post\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-seat-post-mtb-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-224191\">Photo by Robyn Wilkinson</figcaption></figure><p><strong>YEP Components: </strong>Mechanically actuated droppers are very fast and not controllable.

By pushing the lever halfway, or partially, it will allow the post to actuate and drop but with some resistance. Doing that, along with slightly suspending your weight off the seat when it drops, will allow you to moderate how fast it will drop.</p><p><strong>Why won’t my&nbsp;dropper&nbsp;seat post stay&nbsp;<span>up</span>&nbsp;(or down) when it gets really cold? I imagine something in the mechanism is freezing. Is there anything I can do to prevent this happening?</strong></p><p><strong>OneUp Components: </strong>Our dropper uses a hydraulic cartridge that is approved for -40C/-40F without significant slow down. We use oil and grease rated for this temperature range and do not use a hydraulic system for actuation (which is usually the issue with this complaint). As with all cable-actuated posts, care needs to be taken to lubricate and therefore not allow water into the cable housing when at room temperature.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg\" alt=\"one up seat post install\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-265x198.jpg 265w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-560x420.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-265x198.jpg 265w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-560x420.jpg 560w\"></a></p><p><strong>YEP Components: </strong>This happens only on hydraulic actuated droppers; there is just one on the market.

The dirt must be cleaned off before the next ride otherwise (especially mud) when it is dried can pass the dust scraper barrier and contaminate the gliding bushing resulting in scratches on the stanchion surface.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg\" alt=\"YEP-UPTIMIZER-3\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1803\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-200x300.jpg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-80x120.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-768x1154.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1022x1536.jpg 1022w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-696x1046.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1068x1605.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-280x420.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-200x300.jpg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-80x120.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-768x1154.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1022x1536.jpg 1022w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-696x1046.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1068x1605.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-280x420.jpg 280w\"></a></p><p>Use a wet soft cloth to clean the scraper lip and add a little suspension oil, the same care you would take with your suspension.</p><p><strong>PNW Components: </strong>The best way to prolong the life of your dropper post is to keep it clean, lubed and maintain it like you would your drivetrain and suspension. Regular maintenance goes a long way and is easy to do. After really dusty or muddy riding we recommend wiping down the main seal with a clean rag as you would your fork seals and rear shock seal.</p><p>It is <em>very</em> important to not let cleaning chemicals like degreasers and high pressure water do the work for you; simply wiping it down with some soap and water on a rag is the best. Some products like Fenwick’s, WPL Fork Boost and others help to keep the main seal from drying out in between major services but it is not a substitute for a proper tear down, clean and lube.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PNW-Components-Loam-Dropper-Black-Belt-ITW-2-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>You will also need to make sure the products you want to use are approved for use on your dropper by consulting the manufacturer.
