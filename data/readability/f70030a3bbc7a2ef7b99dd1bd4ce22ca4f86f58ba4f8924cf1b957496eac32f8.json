Grace Brown (Team BikeExchange) took the win and will lead the overall into the second stage of the race. Elise Chabbey (Canyon-SRAM) and Niamh Fisher-Black (SD Worx) came in second and third. The peloton containing many of the race favourites finished five seconds later.</p><p>A break of two slipped away from the much-reduced peloton over the top of the Alto de la Lora climb with 5 km to go. Fisher-Black bridged to join Brown and Chabbey while Trek-Segafredo chased.</p><p>With 1.5 kilometres to go the three out front had gained a 16-second advantage on the chasing peloton, but the uphill drag to the finishing town favoured the peloton’s speed rather than the breakaway’s climbing abilities.</p><p>Brown proved to be the strongest sprinter of the three and came away with stage honours.</p><div><div><p>Vuelta a Burgos Feminas (2.WWT) <span>Villadiego → Sargentes de la Lora</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/ce/grace-brown-2021-n2.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f70030a3bbc7a2ef7b99dd1bd4ce22ca4f86f58ba4f8924cf1b957496eac32f8","category":"Cycling"}
