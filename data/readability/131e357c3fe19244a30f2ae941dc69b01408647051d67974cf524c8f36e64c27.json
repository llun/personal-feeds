Pay once and it's yours, there's no recurring fee.</p><h3>What are the requirements?</h3><p>You'd install Sendy on an online Apache web server with Linux, PHP &amp; MySQL support, just like Wordpress! Almost all hosting companies support them.</p><h3>Is Sendy easy to setup?</h3><p>Yes. Just follow our <a href=\"https://sendy.co/get-started\" title=\"\">Get Started Guide</a> to get up and running.</p><h3>Are updates free?</h3><p><a href=\"https://sendy.co/get-updated\" title=\"\">Updates</a> are free up till the next major version, eg. version 5.x, 6.x etc. Major versions don't come so often, so you'd receive more new features in free minor versions than major ones.</p><h3>What's SES send rate and limit?</h3><p>Once signed up for Amazon SES, submit the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ses/extendedaccessrequest\" target=\"_blank\">SES Sending Limits form</a> to request for your desired daily sending limit. Eg. if you need to send 10k emails daily, request Amazon for a daily sending limit of 10k emails per day.</p></div><div><h3>Can I install Sendy on multiple domains?</h3><p>Sendy can be installed on one domain per license. To install Sendy on more domains, you need additional licenses. Sendy's licensed domain is just 'where you install Sendy on'. You can send emails belonging to any domain you want.</p><h3>Are Sendy's files obfuscated?</h3><p>Sendy's files are not obfuscated except for the installation and functions file. You can edit the source code for your own personal use without needing these two files.</p><h3>What's with Sendy's low pricing?</h3><p>Sendy is a self hosted app, you host it on your own web hosting server instead of ours, so you don’t pay us monthly fees. Emails are sent via Amazon SES at a jaw dropping low rate of only $1 per 10,000 emails. Amazon is known to provide great value at ridiculously low prices. The result? Thousands of happy Sendy users enjoy great results without costing an arm and a leg.</p></div><div><div id=\"get-your-copy\"><p id=\"buy-text\">Sendy is yours for a one time payment. You can then save a 100x for every campaign. But these savings are useless if your emails can't be delivered to the inbox. That is why Sendy uses Amazon SES to send your emails. If you encounter problems, we will help you. If it doesn't work out, we'll refund you.</p><p><span>$</span>69</p><p><span>One time fee</span></p><br></div><div id=\"accolades\"><div><p><a href=\"http://jonathanwthomas.net/quitting-mailchimp-and-moving-my-small-business-email-marketing-to-sendy-for-a-fraction-of-the-cost/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cdn.sendy.co/accolades-jonathan.png\" title=\"Jonathan W.
