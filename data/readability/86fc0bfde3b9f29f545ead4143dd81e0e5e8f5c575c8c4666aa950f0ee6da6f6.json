No matter your gut feeling, handlebars are getting more specific for the ride and rider. One racing realm that has stayed away from the UCI is gravel and adventure racing. Mostly because there isn’t a World Championship (yet), and the sport is so freeform that I believe it would be hard to have one.</span></p><p><span>Gravel’s unsanctioned nature gives handlebar manufacturers the freedom to create, explore and redefine ways to keep our hands comfortable over miles of pebbles. This has lead to wider, sculpted, flared bars all over the world. Profile Designs is looking past the wider trend, and taking aim on reinventing the way handlebars are sized for each rider.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install-.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM Neo Sonic full bike install\" width=\"1280\" height=\"838\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install-.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--297x194.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--800x524.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--120x79.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--768x503.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--696x456.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--1068x699.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--642x420.jpeg 642w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--741x486.jpeg 741w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--297x194.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--800x524.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--120x79.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--768x503.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--696x456.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--1068x699.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--642x420.jpeg 642w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063649/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-bike-install--741x486.jpeg 741w\"></a></p><p><span>When most people hear Profile Designs, they think of aero bars, aero bottles, aero wheels — tarmac terrain, roadie stuff.

So the smallest DRV (105mm) size has the least reach and drop and is available in the smaller widths. The next size (120mm) increases drop and reach to give more room for larger hands and is available in wider sizes.”</em></span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side-.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM Neo Sonic full set up side\" width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side-.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--768x513.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--696x465.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--629x420.jpeg 629w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--768x513.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--696x465.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063715/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-set-up-side--629x420.jpeg 629w\"></a></p><h3>What does that mean in basic bike terms?</h3><p><span>The DRiVe is the location on the bars where you, as a rider, will instinctively place your hands.

Most gravel bars (that I’ve ridden) flare out from the drops directly. This abrupt change takes the brake levers and places them in an awkward position — pointing them inward and compromising comfort and handling for the rider. The DRV/GRM bar takes the top of the bars, similar to a traditional road bar (except for the added 9mm rise), and flares the drops out about halfway down.</span></p><h3>How do you find your drive?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe-.png\" alt=\"Profile Designs How to find you DRiVe\" width=\"691\" height=\"585\" sizes=\"(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe-.png\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe-.png 497w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe--297x252.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe--120x102.png 120w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe-.png 497w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe--297x252.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064038/Profile-Designs-How-to-find-you-DRiVe--120x102.png 120w\"></a></p><p><span>Profile Designs uses its DRiVe measurement system to take the rider’s overall hand width and calculates it into the perfect DRiVe size.

I’ve had the same 42cm short, shallow bar on this particular bike for many seasons, and I was sure I’d notice a difference right away. Unfortunately, I noticed a difference right from the start, as the DRV/GRM does not have an internal routing port, making it a bit difficult to install. Considering this is a $91 alloy gravel bar, and one of the most popular groupsets (GRX Di2 would be fitted on it), the lack of foresight was a bit unnerving. But after a quick drill, hone, and sand, I was all cleared to install the DRV with my Di2 setup. For Di2 builds, you’ll probably want to wait for the potential carbon version (below).&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop-.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM side drop\" width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop-.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--768x513.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--696x465.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--629x420.jpeg 629w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--768x513.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--696x465.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12064000/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-side-drop--629x420.jpeg 629w\"></a></p><p><span>I chose the 42cm bar with 105mm drop and 70mm reach — something similar to the bar I was riding and also fit within the Profile Designs DRiVe system for my liking.

I kept the same 120mm stem and spacer stack I usually ride on my bike and noticed the short reach and 9mm rise from the first pedal stroke. Why 9mm, you ask?

The DRV/GMR bars took much less time to fine-tune and adjust. Maybe this is because of the laid-back nature of the design and exaggerated drops, but I feel the familiar hand position and short-reach helped immensely. The bar placed me in a less aggressive posture, with the ability to more effectively drive the bike off-road and feel comfortable on gravel.</span></p><p><span>The DRV/GMR has decent compliance for an alloy bar, but I wouldn’t consider the bar flexible or compliant for rocky roads. The drops seem to have a bit of flex, but when you’re riding a 48mm tire, that compliance could be from anywhere.</span></p><h3>Neosonic <span>45ra</span> Aero Bar Impressions</h3><p><span>The other piece to the DRV/GRM puzzle is the aero bars attachment — the Neosonic 45A.

Though the idea of aero on a gravel bike is highly contested and debated, one thing is for sure — comfort on gravel and long or multi-day events is paramount. Looking over the Neosonic 45ra, I believe that comfort and efficiency were at the forefront of design. However, if you dial in the position and train in the tuck, you will undoubtedly shave some time off your ride.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture-.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM Neo Sonic pad texture\" width=\"1280\" height=\"855\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture-.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--768x513.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--696x465.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--629x420.jpeg 629w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--768x513.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--696x465.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063759/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-pad-texture--629x420.jpeg 629w\"></a></p><h3>Profile Designs Neosonic/Ergo/45ra Vitals</h3><ul><li>Armrest Offset: -95mm to -42.5mm in 7.5mm steps</li><li>Armrest Width: 124mm to 290mm in 18.5mm steps (With Extensions at 100mm)</li><li>Armrest Stack: 59mm (no riser kit) to 130mm in 5mm increments (With aftermarket Riser Kit)</li><li>Extension Width: 100mm</li><li>Handlebar Clamp: 31.8mm</li><li>Extension Clamp: 22.2mm</li><li>Weight: 563g</li><li>Price: $161.00</li></ul><p><span>Adding extra weight to a bike is not always a good thing, but when it adds comfort and efficiency, that weight is essentially negated.

Riding in the aero position took some getting used to. Admittedly, I’ve done very little time in the tuck, so I was prepping for lower back pain but the position feels natural. The padding on the armrests is plush, soaking up small bumps and knocks in the gravel, and the curved top is easy to grip and steer. The bars only came a few inches from the end of my shifters and didn’t interfere with the bike’s functionality. Although, I did have to take off my handlebar snack bag… all for aero, I guess.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad-.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM Neo Sonic poad\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1004\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad-.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--297x233.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--800x628.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--120x94.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--768x602.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--696x546.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--1068x838.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--535x420.jpeg 535w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--297x233.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--800x628.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--120x94.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--768x602.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--696x546.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--1068x838.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063816/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-poad--535x420.jpeg 535w\"></a></p><p><span>The idea of riding on aero bars in a less than super smooth environment made me weary. But I faced my fear —double-checked my torque setting and hit the chunky country gravel for some hammer time. The feeling is oddly comfortable while cruising through the chipped gravel in an aero position. I let the wide-open sections of gravel road have it, and I hammered away. The width of the Neosonic gives some pleasant steering sensations. I felt sturdy and not out of control when navigating around a slight bend or road obstacle.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view-.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM Neo Sonic riders view\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view-.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--630x420.jpeg 630w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view-.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--297x198.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--800x534.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--120x80.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--768x512.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--696x464.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--1068x713.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063834/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-riders-view--630x420.jpeg 630w\"></a></p><p><span>After pedaling longer in the aero position, I opted to move the pads back toward myself — I found this gave my forearms more support. The padding helps a bunch. Being able to sink into the pads took the pressure off my lower back and let me roll easily. I added some of Profile Designs’ Aero Bar Tape to the bar, which I found helps my sweaty hands from slipping around. The only thing I was left wanting was a computer mount.&nbsp; I ending up strapping my Garmin Forerunner to the bars for most rides. This was due to convenience/laziness on my part — there are many mount systems available, and you should get one with your aero bar purchase first thing as the NeoSonic 45a does not come with one.</span></p><h3>The whole package</h3><p><span>The whole package works very well together, and the overall vision is clear to see. The Neosonics addition doesn’t make this a full-on race aero setup, but more of a comfort-enabling performance system. The bars’ multiple hand locations are fantastic, but when you add the Neosonic, you add so many more options to keep you comfortable on long races, gravel adventures, or when touring.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on.jpeg\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV:GRM Neo Sonic full setup head on\" width=\"1280\" height=\"745\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on.jpeg\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-297x173.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-800x466.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-120x70.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-768x447.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-696x405.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-1068x622.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-722x420.jpeg 722w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on.jpeg 1280w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-297x173.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-800x466.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-120x70.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-768x447.jpeg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-696x405.jpeg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-1068x622.jpeg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063732/Profile-Designs-DRVGRM-Neo-Sonic-full-setup-head-on-722x420.jpeg 722w\"></a></p><p><span>When I had Neosonic aero bars installed, I missed being able to place my hand on the tops of the bars when climbing, especially on hard pitches.

There is a cable entry hole at the end of the channel, which you can see in the image.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye.png\" alt=\"Profile Designs DRV Carbon prototype\" width=\"1159\" height=\"492\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1159px) 100vw, 1159px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb8 src ng ngcb8 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye.png\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye.png 1159w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-297x126.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-800x340.png 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-120x51.png 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-768x326.png 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-696x295.png 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-1068x453.png 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-989x420.png 989w\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye.png 1159w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-297x126.png 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-800x340.png 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-120x51.png 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-768x326.png 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-696x295.png 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-1068x453.png 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12063520/Profile-Designs-DRV-Carbon-prototye-989x420.png 989w\"></a></p><p><span>We’re guessing this channel is to run full internal hoses and wires if needed for the stem/headset. The big channel looks to avoid extreme bends out of the shifter port, which is super annoying when routing a new bar.</span></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p><span>The Profile Designs DRV/GMR bar and Neosonic aero bar are a significant upgrade or addition to your gravel-adventure setup. They both function well independently, but the full package is a mix of comfort and power when you need it. The price is premium for aluminum; $91 for the DRV/GMR bar and $161 for the Neosonic, and the bars are not Di2 plug and play ready. But the unique ergonomics and potential for increased comfort may make them worth the price of admission.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=\"https://profile-design.com/collections/drop-bars/products/drv-gmr\">www.Profile-Design.com</a></p></div></div>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"86fc0bfde3b9f29f545ead4143dd81e0e5e8f5c575c8c4666aa950f0ee6da6f6","category":"Cycling"}
