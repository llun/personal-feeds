After dropping off the second stage in a parking orbit, the first stage reentered Earth's atmosphere for a rendezvous with a drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>Alas, the rocket never made it to the boat. The company's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0dkyV09Zso&amp;feature=youtu.be\">launch webcast</a> included a video from the drone ship, <em>Of Course I Still Love You</em>, and a distant glow could be seen on the horizon when the rocket was due to land.</p><p>\"We did get a little bright glow... no longer see a flame there... it does look like we did not land our booster,\" said launch commentator Jessica Anderson, a manufacturing engineer at SpaceX. \"It is unfortunate that we did not recover this booster, but our second stage is still on a nominal trajectory.\"</p><h2>Payload made it</h2><p>As Anderson noted, the second stage did perform its job, ultimately delivering the latest batch of Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit. As the company continues to grow its number of operational satellites above 1,000, it plans to expand Starlink Internet service to more of North America later this year.</p><p>It is not clear whether there was a problem with one of the rocket's controlled engine burns during reentry or a telemetry issue that caused the first stage to go awry. SpaceX did not provide any additional information about the failure.</p><p>This was the sixth flight of this first stage, B 1059, which made its debut in December 2019 by flying a Cargo Dragon mission to the International Space Station.</p><p>The also was SpaceX's first failed landing since March 2020, breaking a streak of two dozen successful launches and landings both at sea and at a land-based landing zone. The previous failure occurred <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1252985622219960327\">due to cleaning fluid</a> used as part of the engine refurbishment process.</p><p>SpaceX had been due to launch yet another Starlink mission as early as Wednesday morning, at 55 minutes past midnight (05:55 UTC) from Kennedy Space Center. However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Raul74Cz/status/1361614776082829316\">public notices indicated</a> that launch may slip at least 48 hours, until Friday morning.</p></div></div>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b40b1fab82daddb6e9370435cc99f29ee59878dcc585bd238025b7cbe5b5b10","category":"Tech"}
