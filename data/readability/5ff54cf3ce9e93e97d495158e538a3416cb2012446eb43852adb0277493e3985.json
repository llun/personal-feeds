{"title":"Saris H3 smart turbo trainer and MP1 Nfinity platform: first look","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9185/saris-h3-smart-turbo-trainer-and-mp1-nfinity-platform-first-look","date":1612282875000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>The Saris H3 is right up there among the top-end smart trainers, being compatible with the big online platforms like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/zwift\">Zwift</a> and TrainerRoad, boasting +/-2% power accuracy, making very little noise (a claimed 59dB at 32kmh) and replicating up to 20% gradients.</p><p>So the next step, says Saris (formerly known as CycleOps), is to make home training even more like riding outdoors. Which is where the Nfinity comes in.</p><p>It’s a platform that you put your bike and turbo trainer on, allowing the whole setup to move in a way that feels like riding on the road for real.</p><p>Conceptually this is nothing new – Kinetic has long since had the Rock and Roll turbo that moves side-to-side – but what makes the Nfinity unique is its 360° ‘multi-dimensional’ movement.</p><p>Using a series of rollers and bowed tracks, the Nfinity can shift 24cm fore-aft and tilt 12° to either side. This, says Saris, not only makes riding feel more natural, but aids performance by engaging the core and upper body as well as the legs.</p><p>Encouraging shifts in weight also alleviates that dead backside feeling that comes from hours sat in a rigid turbo position.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dennismags.co.uk/cyclist\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/clickable_subs_promo.jpg\" alt=\"click to subscribe\"></a></p><p>The Nfinity is designed with the H3 turbo trainer in mind, but Saris says the platform will work equally well with most other trainers and the company provides a guide for how to secure each model to the solid birchwood base using straps that fit in special grooves in the platform.</p><p>At a pound shy of a grand, the Nfinity is more expensive than most turbos, but if money is no problem then it will add a new dimension to your indoor training.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"5ff54cf3ce9e93e97d495158e538a3416cb2012446eb43852adb0277493e3985","category":"Cycling"}
