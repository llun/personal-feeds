The new logo features a leaf that's angled differently, a small change that Apple apparently feels makes it different enough from the famous Apple logo. Prepear's app icon has also been tweaked.</p><p><img alt=\"prepear app logo changes\" width=\"418\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QRFpwb0Sbi9q3_Tx_WySoc_130Y=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QRFpwb0Sbi9q3_Tx_WySoc_130Y=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QRFpwb0Sbi9q3_Tx_WySoc_130Y=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/uFmrqrbS9YMxwRe42Zl7z34FwAo=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/0E9QTQNayimI3tMAD_l2oDqXcn0=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2GjheHH8NCx9Ad6EqBdbTEUmYkg=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/QRFpwb0Sbi9q3_Tx_WySoc_130Y=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/uFmrqrbS9YMxwRe42Zl7z34FwAo=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/0E9QTQNayimI3tMAD_l2oDqXcn0=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/2GjheHH8NCx9Ad6EqBdbTEUmYkg=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/prepear-app-logo-changes.jpg 2500w\"><br>Following the initial trademark opposition, Super Healthy Kids, Prepear's parent company, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos\">launched a petition</a> in an attempt to persuade Apple to drop its opposition targeting a small business that was trying to protect its logo, and that petition gained over 250,000 signatures.
