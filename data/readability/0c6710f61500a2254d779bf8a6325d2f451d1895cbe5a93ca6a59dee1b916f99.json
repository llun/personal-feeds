That works out to about 128g lighter than a 2021 Transfer.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer SL dropper post opening window\" width=\"1002\" height=\"699\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802.jpg 1002w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-297x207.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-800x558.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-120x84.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-768x536.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-696x486.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-602x420.jpg 602w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-100x70.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802.jpg 1002w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-297x207.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-800x558.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-120x84.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-768x536.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-696x486.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-602x420.jpg 602w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224649/Fox-Factory-Transfer-SL-dropper-post-details-8-e1622518051802-100x70.jpg 100w\"></a></p><p>Other than the decreased weight, the Transfer SL gets another improvement with a revised cable anchor. Now housed inside the post thanks to the two windows that allow access, you can anchor either end of the cable at the post. That allows you to run dropper post levers like Shimano GRX drop bar levers – or any dropper lever for that matter.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5.jpg\" alt=\"Fox Transfer SL dropper post black Performance elite\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/31224659/Fox-PErformance-Elite-black-Transfer-SL-MTB-dropper-post-details-5-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a></p><p><span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-box-4\"></span>Offered in 27.2, 30.9, and 31.6mm post diameters, travel is kept to a minimum of 50 and 70mm for the 27.2mm posts.
