Now, the bug is causing links to appear without the thumbnail preview or related information.</p><p>Thankfully, there is a logical explanation as to why this is occurring. Security research team Mysk did some digging at the behest of <em>Mashable</em> to backward engineer iMessage and Instagram. The team found that when iMessage attempts to fetch the metadata for the link, Instagram directs the request to its login page. Instagram's login page doesn't hold metadata, which includes a thumbnail of the post.</p><p>Mysk is the same security team that, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/facebook-instagram-link-previews-break-privacy-law/\">earlier this month</a>, found that Facebook and Instagram link previews could be violating EU privacy laws. Mysk believes that the preview of the link that is generated when a URL is sent in Facebook Messenger and Instagram may be infringing on multiples articles of the ePrivacy directive, which states that personal data can only be accessed by authorized personnel for legal purposes.</p><p>As a result, Facebook no longer generates link previews for EU users in Messenger and Instagram. There's no indication, however, that the bug with iMessage is related to the reported breach of privacy law, so it certainly seems to be an issue on Instagram's side.</p><p><small>Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/political-news.218/\">Political News</a> forum.
