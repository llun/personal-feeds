You’re forced to settle on one design that should somehow climb like a goat, yet also eat up rough descents with ease. Recent geometry trends have vastly improved rider weight balance and overall handling, but Rocky Mountain’s 2021 Instinct offers solid modern geo <em>and</em> enough adjustability that anyone should be able to tune this bike to their terrain or riding style.</p><figure id=\"attachment_260096\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260096\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x322/rscb13/ng:webp/ngcb13\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, side, on trail\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-297x198.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-120x80.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-768x512.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-696x464.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-630x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x322/rscb13/ng:webp/ngcb13\" ezoid=\"0.19705888488280565\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-297x198.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-120x80.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-768x512.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-696x464.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140712/RMB-Instinct-2021-side-on-trail-630x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb13 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-260096\">*Please note the saddle and rear tire in this photo are not stock parts.

The XL, large and medium frames roll on 29” wheels, but RMB runs 27.5” wheels on XS frames and smalls get the option of 27.5” or 29”.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-medrectangle-3\"></span></p><p>The new Instinct’s Smoothlink linkage was redesigned to improve pedalling efficiency and handle rough descents better. The Instinct’s tune is different from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/10/30/long-term-review-rocky-mountains-2021-altitude-carbon-70-29-is-a-long-travel-quiver-killer/\">RMB’s Altitude</a> enduro bike, prioritizing all day pedalling performance over big hit capabilities. The re-shaped front end tubing and dual bearings at the Instinct’s chainstay/seatstay junction both improve frame stiffness.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, actual weight\" width=\"583\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale.jpg 583w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale-219x300.jpg 219w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale-87x120.jpg 87w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale-306x420.jpg 306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale.jpg 583w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale-219x300.jpg 219w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale-87x120.jpg 87w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140602/RMB-Instinct-2021-on-scale-306x420.jpg 306w\"></a></p><p>Rocky Mountain keeps their weights well within reason: the medium Instinct Carbon 70 weighed in at 31.81 lbs (with pedals).</p><h3>Suspension Setup:</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, rear shock\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140707/RMB-Instinct-2021-shock-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></strong>With its revised linkage the new Instinct runs similar air pressures to Rocky Mountain’s Altitude, requiring more psi than the usual ‘body weight’ setup. You’ll have to look at Rocky’s setup chart to find your starting point, but beyond that the Instinct doesn’t require any special tuning. I weigh 145 lbs and I’m running 180psi in the Fox Float DPX2 rear shock. My compression is two clicks from wide open, and I started with the rebound at 11/15 clicks toward the Fast end.

I’m 5’10” and find the medium Instinct 29er very comfortable. The 456mm reach in fully Slack mode feels great, putting me in a centered body position but not stretching my arms out too much to whip the bike around when needed. I conducted most of my test in the Instinct’s slackest Pos. 1, as that suits my steep, rough local trails.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-leader-1\"></span></p><p>I really like this bike fully slacked out; it offers near-enduro handling (particularly in Long mode). That said, its mid-range travel makes for a very fun bike that will smash through rough trails but won’t let you get lazy about it! I’d say a 65.1° head angle is perfect for this bike – fairly slack but never cumbersome for technical trail riding.</p><p>While it contributes to the bike’s stable ride, the Instinct’s BB sits pretty low with the bike slacked out. I was regularly tagging cranks on low-lying obstacles, so you do have to pedal carefully on rougher climbs.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, Steve Fisher, climbing 1\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140718/RMB-Instinct-2021-Steve-Fisher-climbing-nimby-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Even in Pos. 1, the seat mast on the Instinct is steep and puts you in a good position for pedalling. As today’s bikes get better and better with their front-back balance, I find myself staying in the saddle more on climbs, and the Instinct was no exception. Traction on both wheels is very good, and only the steepest uphill pitches required a stand-up effort rather than a slight forward lean.</p><p>For my last few rides, I put the Instinct’s Ride 9 chip into Pos. 7. The 464mm reach felt longer right away but I quickly got comfortable with the change. It’s lengthy but not too long, so I still found the steering comfortable on descents. The increased reach definitely shifts you into a great position for powerful pedalling: I was happy with the bike slacked out, but it only climbs better as you steepen the angles. Pos. 7 leaned me just a little bit more forward, and it really emphasized the bike’s climbing prowess.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, Steve Fisher, climbing, side\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140637/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-2-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>The slightly steeper 65.8° head tube angle is noticeable, but I found it helped more on the climbs than hurt on the descents.

I certainly didn’t notice a huge loss of stability at high speeds, but lower is definitely better if downhill thrashing is your cup of tea.</p><p>My legs are a bit long for my height, but I have no issues with the Instinct’s standover clearance.

At 436/438mm RMB isn’t offering the stubbiest rear end on the market, but they’ve struck a suitable balance between agility and stability/traction. Climbing traction is already very good, and given its generous reach the Instinct provides that ‘dead between the wheels’ feel across its range of settings. In short mode the Instinct easily handles tight switchbacks, just like you’d expect a trail bike to.</p><p><span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-leader-4\"></span>On descents the rear end feels quite fitting for the bike in short mode. The Instinct pops around tight corners pretty well considering its modern dimensions, and it offers good stability from its fairly lengthy wheelbase and low BB (when slacked out).</p><p>While flipping the dropout chip makes a noticeable difference, the Instinct doesn’t feel like a whole different beast in long mode. It definitely enjoys a little boost in stability, and it does slow down a bit in the corners, but it doesn’t suddenly become an enduro bike.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, Steve Fisher, climbing 2\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140642/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-MG-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>What I find interesting is how much I like the longer rear end for climbing. Again, cornering is a bit slower, yet I haven’t ridden a single switchback that made the bike feel awkwardly long. Where I really appreciate the longer rear end is on steep climbs. With the increased wheelbase, it seems like your body positioning would have to be way off to hamper traction. When a steep climb forces your weight backwards, the rear wheel only seems to gain traction and the front end doesn’t want to lift like it would on older, shorter bikes.</p><p>When descending the longer rear end feels great and provides impressive stability at high speeds. The longer chainstays do slow down your turns a bit, but I found only the tightest technical corners required a little extra swing of the hips. On faster flow trails or any kind of berm, I didn’t feel like long mode was slowing me down at all.</p><p>With the Instinct, terrain will most likely dictate the rider’s preference for short or long mode. If your home trails aren’t particularly steep or rough, I’d say short mode offers the best all-around geometry for trail rambling. However, if you have some gnarly trails at hand, the Instinct in long mode offers the most stable ride I’ve yet experienced from a mid-travel bike.</p><h3>Suspension – Climbing:</h3><p><strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, Steve Fisher, climbing 3\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140631/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-climbing-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></strong>While I’d gladly say the Instinct is the best pedalling Rocky Mountain I’ve ridden yet, I still prefer to climb with the rear shock in firm mode. RMB’s linkage is initially very active and moves freely to smooth out small bumps, which it does well, but I find using the shock’s firm setting greatly reduces pedal bob. Even in firm mode, traction on technical trails is very good and if you hit something hard, the Fox DPX2 shock will still open up to absorb it.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, linkage\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140545/RMB-Instinct-2021-linkage-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>While the initial stroke is soft the Smoothlink linkage doesn’t wallow under pedalling efforts, using about 50-60% travel on a singletrack climb. I also noticed the Instinct’s stand-up pedalling performance was very good, resisting heavy bobbing under hard efforts (with the shock in firm) and maintaining forward momentum well. If you choose to climb technical trails with the shock in medium or open mode the linkage will keep you floating along at half travel, and you’ll get optimum traction for a small sacrifice in pedalling efficiency.</p><p>Most of my test was ridden in the slackest/most progressive Ride 9 chip Pos. 1, but I jumped to Pos. 7 for my last several rides. Moving towards Pos. 9 does make the shock more linear, but while climbing the Instinct’s linkage refused to acknowledge this, keeping me cranking along at roughly half travel.</p><h3>Descending:</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, angle, left\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140425/RMB-Instinct-2021-angle-left-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Given the steep terrain in my area I really wanted to keep the Instinct in its slackest position, but I have had issues with other RMB bikes ramping up too much for me in that setting – I’m a lightweight at 145 lbs. I was pleased to find the Instinct’s linkage felt less progressive than the Altitude, and I had no trouble bottoming out the bike in the slackest Ride 9 chip position. Both bikes come with one spacer in the rear shock, and I regret not pulling it from the Altitude but don’t feel the need with the Instinct.</p><p>Now I don’t want to suggest the Instinct is too soft or squishy: There’s still enough mid-stroke support to give the bike RMB’s characteristically lively ride, and it does take a good thump to squeeze all the travel from the rear end.</p><figure id=\"attachment_260079\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260079\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, Steve Fisher crashing\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-629x420.jpg 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-768x513.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-696x465.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140455/RMB-Instinct-2021-crash-629x420.jpg 629w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-260079\">*Good thing this was the last photo I wanted!

I slowed down the rebound by 5 clicks and it did what I wanted in an obvious manner – the bike felt much more plowy through chattery rough patches, and much less bouncy. The rear tire was rolling through bumps instead of hopping along on top of them, and I felt a noticeable improvement in traction and handling in rough sections. I added two clicks back (faster) after that lap and the ride is nicely balanced now, sucking up repeated hits nicely but still feeling lively and poppy. I start out with every test bike near or within recommended suspension settings, but I liked the Instinct with a bit less rebound, and will keep that in mind for future RMB reviews.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, Steve Fisher, steep rock\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock.jpg 533w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock-200x300.jpg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock-80x120.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock-280x420.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock.jpg 533w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock-200x300.jpg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock-80x120.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140702/RMB-Instinct-2021-SF-steep-rock-280x420.jpg 280w\"></a></p><p>Anticipating a more linear shock rate, I added 5psi to the Instinct’s rear shock when I moved into Pos. 7.

The medium Instinct’s 150mm model was unfortunately no exception. The posts almost always stick on the first lift fresh out of the shed, and frequently top out below maximum height or stick down while I’m out on the trail. On the positive side, I do find the WTB Volt Race saddle agreeable with my behind.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle.jpg\" alt=\"2021 RMB Instinct, with eagle\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26140509/RMB-Instinct-2021-eagle-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>The Instinct Carbon 70 retails for $6899.
