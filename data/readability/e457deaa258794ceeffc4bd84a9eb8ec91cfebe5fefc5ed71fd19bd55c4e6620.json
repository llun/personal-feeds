Alpecin-Fenix led the way into the last kilometer, putting <strong>Jasper Philipsen</strong> in a strong position for the final sprint, and the Belgian jumped out to a healthy lead with around 200 meters to go. Cavendish, however, kicked with an impressive turn of speed, and managed to surge past Philipsen inside the last 50 meters.</p><p>The 35-year-old Manxman nabbed the victory with Philipsen settling for second and <strong>André Greipel</strong> in third. Having finished fourth on stage 1, Cavendish moved into the overall lead with his stage 2 win.</p><p>The victory is Cavendish’s first in more than three years; he last took a pro win on stage 3 of the 2018 Dubai Tour.</p><p>“It’s incredible, it’s really nice to be a winner again,” Cavendish said. “I’ll never get tired of that feeling.”</p><p></p><h3>Gilbert set to return for La Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège</h3><p><strong>Philippe Gilbert</strong>, who opted to “take a period of necessary rest, both physically and mentally” instead of racing the Tour of Flanders, is set to return to racing next week. The 38-year-old Belgian is slated to race <strong>La Flèche Wallonne</strong> and then <strong>Liège-Bastogne-Liège</strong>, both events he has won in the past.</p><p>“Hello everyone, I’m happy to announce that I’ll be back racing at La Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège,” Gilbert said in a video posted to social media. “It will be a chance to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of those two beautiful victories on my palmarès.”</p><h3>Pidcock and Carapaz headline the Ineos Grenadiers for Brabantse Pijl</h3><p>The Ineos Grenadiers have unveiled their roster for Wednesday’s <strong>Brabantse Pijl</strong>, confirming that <strong>Tom Pidcock</strong> and <strong>Richard Carapaz</strong> will make the start.</p><p>Also set to race Brabantse Pijl for the Ineos Grenadiers are <strong>Leonardo Basso</strong>, <strong>Eddie Dunbar</strong>, <strong>Michal Golas</strong>, <strong>Luke Rowe</strong>, and <strong>Cameron Wurf</strong>.</p><h3>Pellaud does not start Tour of Turkey after COVID-19 positive</h3><p><strong>Simon Pellaud</strong> did not start the <strong>Tour of Turkey</strong> after testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The 28-year-old Italian said on social media on Monday that he tested negative twice before arriving in Turkey, but then registered a positive test upon arrival. He said that he is asymptomatic and did not have close contact with any of his Androni-Giocattoli teammates.</p><h3>Former French junior national champ Theo Nonnez retires at age 21</h3><p><strong>Theo Nonnez</strong>, who won a French junior national road title in 2016, has called it a career. The 21-year-old had ridden with the Groupama-FDJ Continental squad since 2019, and the team announced the news on Monday in a post on its website in which Nonnez explained that he had decided to call it a career “after a long period of reflection.”</p><p>“I think we can call it a burnout, even though it’s rather an addition of many things that got me to this point,” he said. “I am not sad to make this decision. On the opposite, it gives me hope again. I had entered a vicious cycle and I didn’t dare talking about how I felt. I realize that I did the right thing with coming out of my silence, because I don’t know what would have happened if I had remained quiet any longer.”</p><h2>In case you missed it …</h2><ul><li><strong>Primoz Roglic</strong> and <strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> look to be the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/roglic-and-pogacar-are-the-best-stage-racers-in-the-world-and-its-not-close/\" target=\"_blank\">world’s best stage racers</a> right now.</li><li>Speaking of Roglic, less than 24 hours after he won the <strong>Itzulia Basque Country</strong>, he was <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/the-work-never-stops-for-a-tour-de-france-contender/\" target=\"_blank\">back on the bike</a>, riding a recon of stage 20 of the <strong>Tour de France</strong>.</li><li><strong>DT Swiss</strong> is now offering a <strong>Ratchet LN</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/dt-swiss-announces-star-ratchet-ln-upgrade-kit-for-lower-end-hubs-and-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">upgrade kit</a>.</li><li>Matt de Neef <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/spotlight-earshots-magnetic-bluetooth-headphones/\" target=\"_blank\">reviews</a> the <strong>Earshots Magnetic Bluetooth Headphones</strong>.</li></ul></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e457deaa258794ceeffc4bd84a9eb8ec91cfebe5fefc5ed71fd19bd55c4e6620","category":"Cycling"}
