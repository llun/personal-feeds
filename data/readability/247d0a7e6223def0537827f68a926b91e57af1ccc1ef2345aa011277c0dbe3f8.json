I have not written off Tom Dumoulin for the Olympic Games yet. As far as I am concerned, he still has a chance to compete in the road race and time trial. I recently had contact with him and discussed this with him. However, Tom is not yet ready to make a decision about his future. The most important thing is that he takes that decision in peace and that I give him plenty of time for that. ”</p><p>Dumoulin was spotted at the side of the road at the Amstel Gold Race recently, rocking a leather jacket. The former time trial world champion appeared to be enjoying the race from the sidelines.</p></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"247d0a7e6223def0537827f68a926b91e57af1ccc1ef2345aa011277c0dbe3f8","category":"Cycling"}
