{"title":"Origin of the Mac OS X Dock Poof Animation","link":"https://techreflect.net/2021/02/22/origin-on-macos-cloud-poof-animation/","date":1615250654000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div id=\"main\" role=\"main\"><article id=\"post-1337\"><div><p>It used to be that when you dragged an item off the Dock and dropped it, the icon would disappear in a puff of smoke and make a satisfying noise. The animation was strangely primitive against the backdrop of the slick user interface of what used to called Mac OS X.</p><p>The animation first appeared in Developer Preview 4 and many thought it was a placeholder for something more polished. However, after awhile, many people seem to take a liking to it. Here’s a series of frames that shows it if you’re not familiar.</p><div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"128\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png 128w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-60x300.png 60w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-54x270.png 54w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\"><figcaption>POOF!</figcaption></figure></div><p>The legendary poof animation came out of a discussion of the Human Interface team that wanted this action to have an animation to go with the very liquid Aqua interface.</p><p>One of the most talented engineers on the team took out a piece of paper. I wish I could say it was a napkin to make the story better.</p><p>On the piece of paper, he drew a series of frames similar to what is pictured above. A quick, five frame animation. The intention of the designer was that these drawings would stoke further discussion. That it would get cleaned up and refined later.</p><p>But that never happened. It shipped as is. And the rest is history.</p><figure><p><iframe title=\"Removing icon from dock sound\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LsiLtEGTzvs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p></figure><div><h3>Related posts:</h3></div></div></article></div></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1b8bfcb248a213caa8246acca57e29bf7ed3d99d0ceaca0b775235b05377868f","category":"Tech"}
