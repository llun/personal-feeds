We’ve seen a growing number of tire pressure monitoring systems recently, and were curious to put some to the test. Unlike many other options, PSIcle simply threads into almost any tube or tubeless-valve, and needs no battery since it’s powered by your phone’s NFC connection…</p><h2>Rover PSIcle lightweight NFC

once you’ve figured out what’s your ideal setup, the trick is keeping it. No matter what tire/tube/tubeless system you use, the air pressure inside your tire seems to always decrease a bit over time. While it’s simple enough to manage with a floor pump before your ride, these small Rover PSIcle sensors simply take the guesswork out of the equation.</p><p>Lean your NFC-equipped smartphone against the sensor on the valve and it displays the exact pressure in your tire, down to the hundredth PSI.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-medrectangle-3\"></span></p><h3>How do they work?</h3><p><a

With a sensor diameter of 21mm and ~7mm thick, the whole setup is just 13mm thick including the valve extension body. Production PSIcle sensors will get a molded EPDM rubber casing that may add an extra millimeter in each direction to secure and protect the sensor, on top of the machined aluminum valve extension. Weight is expected to stay at just 5g apiece, 10g for the pair.</p><p>The patent-pending &amp; IP67 waterproof PSIcle design &amp; electronics are all complete (<em>as we’ve tested it below</em>). Now Rover is waiting for successful crowdfunding before they build out the production circuits, final mold, and begin production in China &amp; Taiwan.</p><figure id=\"attachment_259881\"

Off-road riding lifespan should be the same as repeated shocks aren’t the concern. It seems more that direct impacts from rocks, sticks &amp; other trail debris could break the sensor just like they would damage a wheel.

Rover engineering team</figcaption></figure><p>“<em>Proper pressure makes my rides easier, and the quick check I get with the sensor gets me out the door faster… I find that I can’t really tell the difference between 85 and 110 psi by pinching my tires, so if I wanted a comfortable and efficient ride, I would hook up my pump to check the pressure. Then the pump deflates the tire a bit, so then I have to put a few pumps back in. Using the PSIcle sensor only saves me that handful of seconds every day, but it just gets me into the flow of my ride so much faster.</em>“</p><h3>Exclusive (P)Review: Tracking all-road &amp; MTB tire

0.38psi change without losing that much or more air, and you definitely couldn’t simply feel the difference.</p><p>(<em>Of note: To get the most accuracy, your phone also needs its own onboard barometric pressure sensor. Otherwise, accuracy could come down to at worst +/- 1psi as you change elevation or weather shifts.

There, the change was still not possible to detect by feel, but now gives us a better way to keep an eye on the pressure drop. Seeing that air loss so clearly, I was a little worried it could result from the leaking at the valve itself.</p><p><a

Rover told us that the seal type on the extension allows enough flexibility to unthread the valve up to 1/4 turn if fully tightening doesn’t align it perfectly without losing air. I wasn’t so comfortable with that, but figure I could add teflon tape to the extension threads if needed to dial it in more precisely.</p><p><a

align it perfectly. Problem solved, but it won’t help those who use PSIcle with inner tubes.</p><p>Rover hasn’t really looked at the aerodynamic drag implications of their PSIcle, only noting that it will certainly be less than more bulky solutions like TyreWiz.

For technical mountain biking it’s great to be able to get this level of accuracy, and I imagine it will be equally useful for gravel, cyclocross, or fat biking. On the road it’s just been useful to track regular air loss, either with lightweight tubeless tires or latex tubes.</p><p><a

Earlybird sets are expected to deliver in September, with the remaining sensors arriving in November 2021. After crowdfund backers get their PSIcles, Rover will offer them directly from their own website and possibly also via Amazon. Global shipping could tack on up to $16 more, which is one reason Rover hopes to refine distribution over the summer.</p><p><a
