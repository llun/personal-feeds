I‚Äôm being censored. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing a piece in a major publication that you are consuming easily and for free. Because I am being absolutely and completely muzzled.</p><p>Also, I just went on a massively-watched TV show to let you know that my voice is being down-right suffocated. I basically can‚Äôt talk to anyone. Which is why I‚Äôm talking to all of you.</p><p>And now I‚Äôm here, in this widely-read media outlet, to say that there is a giant piece of tape over my mouth and, more importantly, the mouth of America. I have the eyes and ears of the world on me, and I am just totally and entirely gagged.</p><p>There‚Äôs no avoiding it: I am being silenced. We‚Äôre all being silenced. And it‚Äôs all any of us can talk about.</p><p>The truth is, you can‚Äôt say anything anymore without someone else saying something about what you just said. And that‚Äôs censorship. There‚Äôs no two ways about it.</p><p>I weep for this country, where the media completely cancels anyone with a different point of view, like the one I‚Äôm expressing in this highly popular newspaper.</p><p>So, what can we do about it? How do we make our voices heard when all we can do is write opinion pieces in major magazines, do interviews on popular TV shows and speak on the floor of the US Senate? Well, as you can see, we‚Äôre in a tight, quiet spot.</p><p>But I‚Äôm not ready to give up ‚Äî not yet! The media elite can do their best to silence me by letting me write and speak anywhere I want, but I won‚Äôt stop saying exactly what I believe to everyone, everywhere, through every means of communication that exists.</p><p>And what I believe (the thing nobody will let me tell you) is this: I‚Äôm being censored, and you can read, hear, and see me talk more about it in the news, on the radio, and on TV.</p></div><div><p>As little as $1 a month ($12 a year!) goes a long way towards supporting our editorial staff and contributors while keeping us ad-free.
