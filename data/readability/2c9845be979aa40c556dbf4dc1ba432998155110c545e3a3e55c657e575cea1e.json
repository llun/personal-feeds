Bissegger now leads the race.</p><p>The 14.4 km TT in Gien featured numerous lead changes after Maxime Bouet rolled down the ramp as the first rider on the course. <strong>Rohan Dennis</strong> spent time in the hot seat after setting a strong early time of 17:47. <strong>Soren Kragh Andersen</strong> took the provisional lead for a little while with a time of 17:44. That held up until Roglic set a mark of 17:40, but the Vuelta a España champ would not spend long in the hot seat as Cavagna went six seconds faster for a time of 17:34.</p><p>Bissegger, however, was three seconds faster than Cavagna at the first time check and maintained a pace just strong enough through the second half of the course to secure the victory and the overall lead.</p><p><strong>Top 10, stage 3</strong></p><p>1 BISSEGGER Stefan (EF Education – Nippo) 0:17:34<br>2 CAVAGNA Rémi (Deceuninck – Quick Step)<br>3 ROGLIC Primoz (Team Jumbo-Visma) 0:06<br>4 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:09<br>5 KRAGH ANDERSEN Soren (Team DSM) 0:10<br>6 DENNIS Rohan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:13<br>7 LAPORTE Christophe (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits)<br>8 VAN BAARLE Dylan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:14<br>9 LAMPAERT Yves (Deceuninck – Quick Step) 0:16<br>10 BEVIN Patrick (Israel Start-Up Nation)</p><p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p><p>1 BISSEGGER Stefan (EF Education – Nippo) 8:37:11<br>2 CAVAGNA Rémi (Deceuninck – Quick Step)<br>3 ROGLIC Primoz (Team Jumbo-Visma) 0:06<br>4 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:09<br>5 MATTHEWS Michael (Team BikeExchange)<br>6 KRAGH ANDERSEN Søren (Team DSM) 0:10<br>7 PEDERSEN Mads (Trek – Segafredo) 0:12<br>8 LAPORTE Christophe (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits) 0:13<br>9 VAN BAARLE Dylan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:14<br>10 LAMPAERT Yves (Deceuninck – Quick Step) 0:15</p><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP7niN-kLjs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><h3>Woods and Martin will miss Tirreno-Adriatico</h3><p>Neither <strong>Mike Woods</strong> nor <strong>Dan Martin</strong> will start <strong>Tirreno-Adriatico</strong> on Wednesday as originally planned.</p><p>Israel Start-Up Nation said on Tuesday that Woods and Martin were not in the final Israel Start-Up Nation roster for the Italian stage race “because of some late developing health issues.” According to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/cycling/mike-woods-bronchitis-tirreno-adriatico-1.5942214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CBC</a>, Woods has been sidelined by bronchitis.</p><h3>Pogacar: ‘Maybe next year it’ll finally be time for the Giro’</h3><p><strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> suggested that there is at least some possibility he’ll race the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> next year in a media appearance ahead of <strong>Tirreno-Adriatico</strong>. The reigning <strong>Tour de France</strong> champ, who is gearing up for another season targeting the Tour, has yet to race the Giro in his career, having started only one Tour and one <strong>Vuelta a España</strong> so far.</p><p>“This year I’ll do the Tour de France, Olympics, and probably the Vuelta, so maybe next year it’ll be finally time for the Giro,” Pogacar said.</p><p>Tirreno-Adriatico will mark Pogacar’s first race in Italy as a pro, and he is aiming high in what will be his second race of the season after he won the UAE Tour.</p><p>“I’m coming here in good shape, I just hope for some solid results and will try for the win,” Pogacar said. “We’ve got a great quality team here too.”</p><h3>Zwift names Pichette and Burgoyne to board</h3><p><strong>Patrick Pichette</strong> and <strong>Celeste Burgoyne</strong> have joined the <strong>Zwift</strong> board of directors.</p><p>Pichette was the CFO of Google from 2008 to 2015 and is currently Chair of both the Twitter and Lightspeed boards of directors, as well as being a partner at Inovia Capital, which has invested in Zwift. Burgoyne has been with Lululemon since 2006 and is currently in the role of President, Americas and Global Guest Innovation.</p><p>“We made a commitment to invest in the very best talent to support Zwift’s growth as a brand, so I’m delighted to be in a position to welcome Patrick Pichette and Celeste Burgoyne to our board of directors,” said Zwift CEO Eric Min in a statement. “Both bring an enormous wealth of experience from their respective fields, covering finance, technology, brand &amp; marketing, retail, eCommerce and fitness.

He is set to race the Giro alongside Vincenzo Nibali this May and is expected to lead Trek-Segafredo at the Vuelta a España later in the year.</p><h2>Coming Up …</h2><p>There will be plenty of pro cycling to watch on Wednesday. Paris-Nice continues with a challenging fourth stage that closes out on a first-category climb. Meanwhile, both Tirreno-Adriatico and the Healthy Ageing Tour will be getting underway. Stage 1 of Tirreno-Adriatico starts and finishes in Lido di Camaiore and should be one for the sprinters, while the Healthy Ageing Tour will kick off with a flat first day.</p><h2>In case you missed it …</h2><ul><li>Alan Coté takes a look at <strong>patent filings</strong> to find out whether <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/are-cleat-based-power-meters-on-the-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cleat-based power meters</a> might be coming.</li><li>Iain Treloar <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/rapha-explore-powerweave-gravel-shoe-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reviews</a> <strong>Rapha’s Explore Powerweave</strong> shoes.</li></ul><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2c9845be979aa40c556dbf4dc1ba432998155110c545e3a3e55c657e575cea1e","category":"Cycling"}
