The Controller interprets that data and signals the Actuator to move the piston, thus pushing fluid into the brake line. Or pulling it back to release the brakes.</p><p>It’s all powered by a battery, which could be rechargeable by any normal means, including by an on-bike generator.</p><h3>But why would we want electronic brakes?</h3><p>Good question.</p><p>Patents aren’t required to answer why, just how. And from our reading of the application, Shimano doesn’t say why they would make this.</p><p>But we have some good guesses.</p><figure id=\"attachment_260239\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-260239\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1.jpg\" alt=\"concept drawing for electronic brake levers from Shimano\" width=\"1200\" height=\"803\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-297x199.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-800x535.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-768x514.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-696x466.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-1068x715.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-628x420.jpg 628w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-297x199.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-800x535.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-768x514.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-696x466.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-1068x715.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/27111359/shimano-electric-braking-patent-concept-drawing-1-628x420.jpg 628w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-260239\">Our concept drawing of what an electric brake lever could look like on a road bike.</figcaption></figure><p>First, the form factor of a brake lever could become anything you wanted it to be.<span data-ez-name=\"bikerumor_com-large-leaderboard-2\"></span></p><p>Second, you could put multiple brake levers on the same bike.

Or have small remote triggers that could be mounted on mini-aero extensions…wherever.</p><p>Third, for handcycles and other non-traditional bicycles or cyclists with different abilities, you could create much more ergonomic solutions.</p><p>Reliable execution is the hard part. Where you can accept that a dead Di2 battery might mean you have to ride home in a less-than-ideal gear combination, a brake failure from a dead battery or unplugged cable is not acceptable. That’s probably been the big obstacle until now. Yet plenty of people fly on planes where all the critical controls are only connected to the pilot by electronic links (<em>hence: fly-by-wire</em>), so maybe if robust enough system integrity is solved, bikes can follow suit.</p><p>And, yes, we suppose you could also make it wireless.</p></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e2ee8dbdc5aa490e1433de40568cca23ecefc61982993fc950b81a10caa182b1","category":"Cycling"}
