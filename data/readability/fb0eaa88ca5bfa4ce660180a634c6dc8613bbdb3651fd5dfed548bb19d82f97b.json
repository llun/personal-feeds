Similar to AirPods Max replacement ear cushions, it is possible that the headbands will be offered in a variety of colors as well.</p><p>Apple has internally discussed pricing the headset around $3,000, according to the report. This price would certainly make Apple's headset a high-end, niche product, with the company apparently setting an internal goal of shipping only 250,000 units of the headset in the first year of its release.
