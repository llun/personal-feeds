Every few releases, they move things around, rename items, and change how it works. But you might have overlooked a long-running option to take some control for yourself. You can choose which preferences appear in the System Preferences app, while the ones you hide remain fully available.</p><p>Launch System Preferences, and then choose <em>View &gt; Customize</em>. This flips the display to show a checkbox overlaid on every preference pane. If you uncheck a box, when you click <em>Done_</em>, that pane no longer appears in the app. However, you can still select it from the View menu, and you can type in its name or any of its included options in the Search field to match against it.</p><p>In Catalina and later, the Apple ID and Family Sharing items are immutable: they must remain.</p><div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-customize-system-preferences.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1007\" alt=\"macOS Big Sur customize System Preferences\"><figcaption><p>Launch System Preferences, and then choose <em>View &gt; Customize</em>.

However, you can break out of Apple’s default categories by choosing <em>View &gt; Organize Alphabetically</em>, which simply lists the panes from A to Z.</p><h2 id=\"ask-mac-911\">Ask Mac 911</h2><p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
