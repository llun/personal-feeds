The app allows users to create their own Bluetooth tags based on the ‌Find My‌ network by installing an \"AirTag\" firmware image on a Bluetooth dongle.</p><p>The app displays the most recent location of a created Bluetooth tag reported by any <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> using Apple's ‌Find My‌ network that was implemented in iOS 13, plus it shows the location of the tag on a map.</p><p>According to the security researchers, the created tags send out Bluetooth beacons, which are picked up by nearby iPhones that interpret the sending device as lost. The current geolocation is end-to-end encrypted and then uploaded to Apple, with the OpenHaystack app then downloading the encrypted report from Apple and decrypting it locally on the Mac.</p><p>In the process of developing this tool, the Secure Mobile Networking Lab researchers also identified a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/\">macOS Catalina</a> ‌Find My‌ vulnerability that was reported to Apple and addressed in a 10.15.7 update <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849\">released back in November</a>. The vulnerability allowed a malicious app to access <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> decryption keys to download and decrypt location reports submitted by the ‌Find My‌ network.</p><p>Apple's iOS 14.5 update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/ios-14-5-beta-3-items-tab-find-my-app/\">includes support</a> for tracking third-party Bluetooth devices in the ‌Find My‌ app using a new \"Items\" tab, which takes advantage of the same ‌Find My‌ protocol used for the Mac app.</p><p>At the current time, in-app tracking is limited to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/powerbeats-pro-find-my-ios-14-support/\">Beats headphones</a> and upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/belkin-magsafe-charger-find-my-earbuds/\">Belkin wireless earbuds</a>, but in the future, many third-party Bluetooth devices may include ‌Find My‌ integration, making it easier to keep track of them. This system will also be used by Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">own rumored AirTags</a>, which have yet to be released.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-lawsuit-programmed-obsolescence-portugal/\">Apple Faces Another iPhone Lawsuit Over 'Programmed Obsolescence'</a></h3><p>Monday March 1, 2021 6:44 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/sami-fathi/\" rel=\"author\">Sami Fathi</a></p><p>Apple faces a new class-action lawsuit that accuses it of deliberately releasing iOS updates that slowly reduce the performance of an iPhone, forcing customers to upgrade their devices.
