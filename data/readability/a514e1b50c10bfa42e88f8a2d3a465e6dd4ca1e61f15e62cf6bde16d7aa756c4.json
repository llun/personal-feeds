Apple develops its own A-series chips that are manufactured by TSMC, but it does use Qualcomm's modem chips.</p><p>Samsung and other Android manufacturers rely on Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips to power their smartphones, and demand has soared over the course of the past few months. Qualcomm is facing shortages of some of the subcomponents used in its chips, and the component issues could impact production of mid and low-end Samsung models.</p><p>A source told <em>Reuters</em> that Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 888 chip is impacted, but it's not clear if this is impacting the manufacturing of Samsung's high-end smartphones. Samsung next week will <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/samsungs-first-unpacked-galaxy-a-series-strike-fear-rivals/\">hold an Unpacked event</a> to unveil its latest mid-range Galaxy A series device, which is expected to compete with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>.</p><p>An executive at a contract manufacturer for several major smartphone brands said that it was facing a shortage of a range of components from Qualcomm and would cut handset shipments, but it's not likely that this is referring to Apple.</p><p>For the most part, the shortages are impacting Qualcomm's older processor technology because Qualcomm is directing key components toward its newer processor options that are more profitable. On Wednesday, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told investors that Qualcomm's demand is \"basically higher than supply.\"</p><p>With a lack of supply, chip component prices are going up. A microcontroller unit chip from STMmicroelectronics, for example, originally sold for $2 but is now priced at $14.</p><p>It's not clear if these chip issues will eventually have some kind of impact on Apple's business, but so far the Cupertino company appears to be able to manufacture devices as normal with no supply shortages.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mini-led-ipad-pro-release-date-rumor/\">12.9-Inch iPad Pro With Mini-LED Display Said to Launch as Soon as Late March</a></h3><p>Taiwanese touch panel maker GIS plans to expand its backend module capacity for new products at its factory in Chengdu, China, according to industry sources cited in a report today from supply chain publication DigiTimes.
