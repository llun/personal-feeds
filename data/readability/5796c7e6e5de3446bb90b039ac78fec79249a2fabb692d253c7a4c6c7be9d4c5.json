For that, you will get the Classified 11-34T x2 system laced into a set of Rose-branded alloy Newmen rims, and a complete bike build with Shimano GRX Di2 rear derailleur &amp; shifters, Rotor Aldhu 46T alloy cranks, Rose’s D-shaped carbon seatpost, and alloy Ritchey WCS Butano bar. Rose claims a weight of 8.6kg for the complete bike (57cm).</p><p><a

Rose offers the Backroad X Classified in six sizes (50-62cm) and either Evil Pepper green or Deepest purple. But all of the complete Classified builds seem to be available to pre-order now, but not expected to ship until the last week of July 2021.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.rosebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>RoseBikes.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5796c7e6e5de3446bb90b039ac78fec79249a2fabb692d253c7a4c6c7be9d4c5","category":"Cycling"}
