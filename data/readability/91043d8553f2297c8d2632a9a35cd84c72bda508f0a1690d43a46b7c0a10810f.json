We use oil and grease rated for this temperature range and do not use a hydraulic system for actuation (which is usually the issue with this complaint). As with all cable-actuated posts, care needs to be taken to lubricate and therefore not allow water into the cable housing when at room temperature.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg\" alt=\"one up seat post install\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-265x198.jpg 265w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-560x420.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-265x198.jpg 265w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oneup-dropper-post-installation-560x420.jpg 560w\"></a></p><p><strong>YEP Components: </strong>This happens only on hydraulic actuated droppers; there is just one on the market.

The stanchion is exposed to the dirt launched by the rear wheel while riding. This is true especially in bad weather. The dirt must be cleaned off before the next ride otherwise (especially mud) when it is dried can pass the dust scraper barrier and contaminate the gliding bushing resulting in scratches on the stanchion surface.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg\" alt=\"YEP-UPTIMIZER-3\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1803\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-200x300.jpg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-80x120.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-768x1154.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1022x1536.jpg 1022w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-696x1046.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1068x1605.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-280x420.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-200x300.jpg 200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-80x120.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-768x1154.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1022x1536.jpg 1022w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-696x1046.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-1068x1605.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/YEP-UPTIMIZER-3-280x420.jpg 280w\"></a></p><p>Use a wet soft cloth to clean the scraper lip and add a little suspension oil , the same care you do to your suspensions</p><p><em><strong>Editor’s Note:&nbsp;</strong></em>We sent these questions to other dropper post manufacturers, including those who manufacture hydraulic-actuated examples.
