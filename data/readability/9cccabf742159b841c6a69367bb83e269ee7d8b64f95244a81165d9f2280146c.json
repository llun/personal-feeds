These are gaming-oriented processors optimized for high clock rates and performance, coming in 19 SKUs ranging from i5-11400T through 19-11900K.</p><p>The new chips, based on Intel's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/a-quick-intel-ces-roundup-new-gaming-laptop-cpus-and-a-glimpse-at-alder-lake/\">Cypress Cove</a> architecture, claim up to 19% increase in Instructions per Clock cycle—a very familiar figure, since it's the same number AMD claimed for gen-on-gen IPC uplift between its Zen 2 and Zen 3 architectures. We'll do some hands-on benchmarking in the near future to determine how important the \"up to\" hedge on that claim matters.</p><p>In the meantime, we're cautiously optimistic about the up to 19% IPC and up to 50% iGPU performance Intel is claiming. As usual, the really big numbers Intel shows for the new generation of processors don't have much to do with general purpose CPU performance—they're tied pretty directly to finding AVX-512 optimized workloads. But the 19% isn't tied to AVX-512, and it has not come at the price of reduced clock speeds or higher rated TDP either.</p><p>Intel is also releasing a new Z590 motherboard chipset. Boards built on Z590 will offer 20 PCI Express 4.0 lanes, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 20Gbps ports, Thunderbolt 4, and improved Direct Memory Interface. The new boards will also support 10th gen processors—but those older CPUs don't have PCIe 4.0 support, so don't expect a new Z590 board to unlock it.</p><p>Rocket Lake-S CPUs are incompatible with H410 or B460 boards, and compatibility with Z490 is <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/why-rocket-lake-cpus-wont-work-on-most-400-series-motherboards\">uncertain</a>&nbsp;at best. If you want a Rocket Lake-S CPU, we strongly recommend a new Z590 board to go with it.</p><div><ul><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i9-and-i7-SKUs-rocket-lake-150x150.png\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i9-and-i7-SKUs-rocket-lake.png\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i9-and-i7-SKUs-rocket-lake-980x553.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/i9-and-i7-SKUs-rocket-lake.png 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1750441\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1750441\"><span></span><p>This table shows all ten Core i9 and Core i7 Rocket Lake-S CPUs.

The i9-10900K was a 10 core, 125W TDP part with maximum single-core boost of 5.3GHz; the i9-11900K matches the TDP and frequency but drops to eight cores. Core i7 and Core i5 CPUs remain 8c/16t and 6c/12t, respectively.</p><p>Ars has product samples of the i9-11900K and i5-11600K processors on hand, along with a new Z590 chipset based motherboard. We'll naturally be offering hands-on benchmark results later this month.</p><p><em>Listing image by Intel</em></p></div></div>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9cccabf742159b841c6a69367bb83e269ee7d8b64f95244a81165d9f2280146c","category":"Tech"}
