I got the first bike that I could travel distances on when I was 14. Granted it was a beach cruiser but hey, we lived at the beach. I’d carry my skateboard and even a surfboard to spots after school and on the weekends. It was a vessel of adolescent liberation.</p><p>For Jonah, a local of Santa Fe, and an employee at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mellowvelobikes/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mellow Velo</a>, the bicycle has helped develop his independence as well as a vehicle to meander around his homeland. His family is one of the deeply embedded heritage households and have been in the area for hundreds of years. Just north of Santa Fe is the town of Chimayo where his family has been weaving for generations under the brand <a href=\"http://www.ortegasweaving.com/acc.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ortega</a>.<span id=\"more-204529\"></span></p><p><em>Santa Fe is full of this kind of heritage. Even the building we shot this bike in front of, the Palace of the Governors, was built around 1618, back when it was a Spanish colony called <em>Nuevo Mexico</em>.</em></p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>His home is surrounded by the Nambé Badlands, an endless desert of eroded drainage lines made up of interwoven trails, all managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Within this network is a short but scenic trail, perfect for riding a plus bike. In the summer, it gets hot, as it’s exposed. In the shoulder seasons, it can be very muddy, with the thickest caliche you could imagine – some of which is still on his bike – but somewhere in between results in the perfect dirt.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-35-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>So how did a youngster like Jonah get his hands on this sweet bike? Well, working at Mellow Velo, he was presented the opportunity to buy the frame second hand and since he lives at home still, he was able to spend his paycheck on parts and bags. Not a bad gig for a twenty-something. He’s been whetting his ax with bikepacking in recent months and this is the perfect bike for the Santa Fe area, with its endless access to trails all around town.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p><em>This is a <a href=\"https://www.kokopellibikes.com/warthog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kokopelli Warthog</a>, their 29+ hardtail model, complete with a chainstay yoke, plenty of clearance, and slider dropouts.
