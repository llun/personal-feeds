A biopsy in January “found the absence of risky arrhythmias for the athlete during the electrophysiological study,” and Ulissi will therefore be able to get back to training.</p><p>The team said that “a periodic monitoring period will follow” for the eight-time Giro d’Italia stage winner before he gets back to racing.</p><h3>Flanders Classics CEO says not having fans at the race won’t be ‘financially feasible’ next year</h3><p>Due to COVID-19 restrictions in Flanders, fans will not be allowed at races until at least April 5, meaning that the Tour of Flanders will run without crowds of spectators at the start and finish this year. Flanders Classics CEO Thomas Van Den Spiegel has said that this is the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/not-having-fans-at-flanders-will-not-be-financially-feasible-next-year-organizer-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">last time</a> that it will be “financially feasible” for organizers to run the race without fans.</p><p>“We are going to perform the trick of organizing without an audience for one more spring, but we can’t keep doing that,” Van Den Spiegel said, according to Standaard.be. “That is no longer financially feasible.”</p><h3>Yates and Martínez will make their first Ineos starts at the UAE Tour</h3><p>The Ineos Grenadiers confirmed that Adam Yates and Daniel Martínez, both of whom joined the team at the start of the year, will make their first racing appearances for the squad at the upcoming UAE Tour, where Yates will start as the defending champion.</p><p>The Ineos Grenadiers released their lineup for the race on Wednesday, with Yates and Martínez set to be joined by Andrey Amador, Filippo Ganna, Brandon Rivera, Luke Rowe, and Iván Sosa.</p><h3>Carapaz trains at 4,800 meters</h3><p>Richard Carapaz has been hard at work training at home in Ecuador recently, and the Ineos Grenadiers provided some details on social media on just how high up he has been riding.</p><p>The 2019 Giro d’Italia winner put in a ride over the weekend on the slopes of the Cotopaxi Volcano, which, as his team points out, is more than 2,000 meters higher than the heights riders reach going over the Stelvio Pass, and nearly 3,000 meters higher than the Alpe d’Huez.</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLUrQIlght1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\"></blockquote><h3>Porte named 2020 AusCycling Cyclist of the Year</h3><p>Richie Porte has been named the 2020 AusCycling Cyclist of the Year after a season that saw him ride onto the overall podium at the Tour de France.</p><p>“For me, this is a massive privilege and an honour to get this award finally,” Porte said via a press release from AusCycling.</p><p>“It has been something I have always wanted to do, so to take it out finally, it is of great satisfaction.”</p><p>Porte was also named Male Road Cyclist of the Year. Grace Brown was named Female Road Cyclist of the Year, after a season that included a victory at Brabantse Pijl and a runner-up ride at Liège-Bastogne-Liège.</p><h2>In case you missed it…</h2><h3>Was cycling better back in the day?</h3><p>In his latest video, Dave Everett ponders wh<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/was-cycling-better-back-in-the-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ether cycling used to be better</a>.</p><h3>POCS’s new Omne Eternal helmet has a solar-powered light that runs itself</h3><p>POC has announced a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/poc-omne-eternal-helmet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new helmet</a> that features a self-powered rear-light.</p><h3>Here’s what the disappearance of PowerTap might mean</h3><p>Ronan Mc Laughlin wonders <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/heres-what-the-disappearance-of-powertap-might-mean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">what the future holds for PowerTap tech</a>.</p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"15ad55737f8cc2a0e91f56ff19eb62c76901814ca87351029987a67fdb3ea289","category":"Cycling"}
