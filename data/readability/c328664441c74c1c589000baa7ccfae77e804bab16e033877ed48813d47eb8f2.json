Both displays feature a wide color gamut and an ultra-low reflection feature that bests the reflectance level of Apple's Pro Display XDR, claims Huawei.</p><p><img alt=\"huawei mate x2\" width=\"968\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/zzxoUycISM-inD6CrjpAntozg6A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/zzxoUycISM-inD6CrjpAntozg6A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/zzxoUycISM-inD6CrjpAntozg6A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_6BMmfy95AChpGOw145aI9SocnI=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/oJ0dFiatKldV7HGCBLt3cGWDJ_U=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/LLtjtMgwqd4cNu3V6TJCgz6pRzA=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"748px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/zzxoUycISM-inD6CrjpAntozg6A=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_6BMmfy95AChpGOw145aI9SocnI=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/oJ0dFiatKldV7HGCBLt3cGWDJ_U=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/LLtjtMgwqd4cNu3V6TJCgz6pRzA=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2.jpg 2500w\"><br>In a neat-looking innovation, a new multi-dimensional hinge design allows for a \"seamless\" fold without a gap, using a water drop-shaped cavity that houses the fold inside. Its dual-spiral structure is made from high-intensity steel that \"eliminates the problem of display creasing,\" and also enables a 40% flatter panel design, claims Huawei.</p><p><img alt=\"mate x2 huawei fold\" width=\"1550\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/lLpGK6QXB1ebZn73HLxPXWwZXIE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/lLpGK6QXB1ebZn73HLxPXWwZXIE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/lLpGK6QXB1ebZn73HLxPXWwZXIE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/FRowjelS6i9V-UBh06saCcRqQoE=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Hy-hXohiDMij660y_lsGQiclt8Q=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/FNaFMXsq23s9Yi6_L1Ah9hedq5M=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/lLpGK6QXB1ebZn73HLxPXWwZXIE=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/FRowjelS6i9V-UBh06saCcRqQoE=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Hy-hXohiDMij660y_lsGQiclt8Q=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/FNaFMXsq23s9Yi6_L1Ah9hedq5M=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/mate-x2-huawei-fold.jpg 2500w\"><br>Camera wise, the Mate X2 features an Ultra Vision Leica Quad setup that offers a \"DSLR-level experience,\" with a 50-megapixel sensor, a 50-megapixel wide-angle lens, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with a 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel \"SuperZoom\" camera with a 10x optical zoom.</p><p>The camera module is housed in the thickest part of the phone, which tapers off. However, despite the tapering design, the device folds in a uniform left and right fashion, so that the taper is not apparent when closed. The majority of the handset's mass is also on the right side of the phone to make it easier to hold when unfolded in either portrait or landscape.</p><p><img alt=\"huawei mate x2 colors\" width=\"2058\" height=\"972\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/209T0lZat75HhPjRliS3NJcWzOg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/209T0lZat75HhPjRliS3NJcWzOg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/209T0lZat75HhPjRliS3NJcWzOg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/-A5uS2qb5XcPyp7vjHLvRzus9fU=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Eo2ApMNEyFSW34GSq1g7bGYVpDA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_dJoKhP1B3mIBiY1ZQCVHP-38mk=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/209T0lZat75HhPjRliS3NJcWzOg=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/-A5uS2qb5XcPyp7vjHLvRzus9fU=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Eo2ApMNEyFSW34GSq1g7bGYVpDA=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/_dJoKhP1B3mIBiY1ZQCVHP-38mk=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/02/huawei-mate-x2-colors.jpg 2500w\"><br>The Mate X2 is powered by the Kirin 9000 5G chip, which debuted in Huawei's Mate 40 Pro last year. It's supported by 8GB of RAM, and a 4,400mAh battery that can be fast-charged at up to 55W. The device also supports dual-SIM 4G/5G use, and comes supplied with a leather case featuring a kickstand.</p><p>The Mate X2 launches in China on February 25, available with either 256GB or 512GB storage, for ¥17,999 (around $2,785) and ¥18,999 (around $2,940), respectively.</p><p>It's unlikely that the Mate X2 will be available in the United States, given Huawei's conflicts with the U.S. government. At any rate, the Mate X2 will launch without support for Google's apps or services, which is likely to limit its appeal outside of China.</p><p>There have been several rumors suggesting that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/lg-apple-foldable-displays/\">exploring</a> folding screen technology. Apple's rumored foldable ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>‌ has been said to feature an OLED display from Samsung, according to reports of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/\">internal durability testing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/\">display sample orders</a>.</p><p>In January, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/\">testing foldable iPhones</a> with a range of display sizes. A recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/\">report</a> from Taiwanese website <em>Economic Daily News</em> claimed that two prototype foldable iPhones had passed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/16/report-apple-sent-folding-iphones-foxconn/\">internal tests</a>, and said that the device could launch in late 2022 or 2023.</p><p>Given the influx of multiple folding smartphones coming to market and the uptick in rumors, Apple is surely looking into the feasibility of its own similar device.
