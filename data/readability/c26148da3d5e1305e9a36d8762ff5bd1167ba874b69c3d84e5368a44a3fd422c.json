As a young child, my goal was always to wear the yellow jersey and ride down the Champs Elysees in front of a crowd of people as the first placed rider.</p><p>The reality is that my cycling journey has been anything but normal and I didn’t follow the typical ‘racing pathway.’ My life spiraled out of control as an early 20 something, partying hard and developing a substance abuse problem. I battled through depression, spent time in rehab, and was lucky enough to come out the other side.</p><p>I still have a dream and like the young boy that once watched the Tour with big open eyes late into the night, I want to ride down the Champs Elysees as the leader of the biggest bike race on earth and in doing so, highlight what is possible with the right mindset and determination.”</p><p>Check back to follow Jack’s progress and if you’re in France join on the road to give Jack a cheer as he passes by.</p><p></p></div></div>","author":"Wahoo Fitness","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c26148da3d5e1305e9a36d8762ff5bd1167ba874b69c3d84e5368a44a3fd422c","category":"Cycling"}
