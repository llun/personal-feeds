A Byronic charisma. A smouldering intensity. Very bad luck as a bicyclist.</p><p>But of all the things about Pinot, one of the most surprising –&nbsp;and charming –&nbsp;is his collection of goats.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s back up to March 2020, when the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kim.goat/\">Kim.Goat</a> Instagram page burst into life.</p><p>There, Thibaut and his girlfriend, Andrea Vannier, catalogue a series of snapshots of their goats and their bucolic existence on the couple’s farm in Mélisey. “At the start of confinement, I went with my girlfriend to buy goat cheese,” Pinot <a href=\"https://www.archyde.com/cycling-i-want-to-go-to-the-end-of-my-story-says-thibaut-pinot/\">told</a> a curious interviewer last June. “I came back with two kids that we had to bottle feed. I had time.” <em>[I trust you can imagine the Gallic shrug, the insouciant pout, as he said that last line, because there’s no way it didn’t happen.]</em></p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9_dP2iFJCR/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\"></blockquote><p>The two young goats, Kim and Quentine, are the stars of the show, but there are occasional cameos from no fewer than four (4) donkeys, some chickens – one of which is a Sussex hen called Chanel – and some cows.</p><p>Intriguingly, CyclingTips has in its possession multiple photographs of Pinot cosying up to yet <em>more</em> goats, as far back as 2017&nbsp;–&nbsp;three full years before Kim and Quentine arrived on the scene –&nbsp;although it is not known whether the goats pictured above remain on the Pinot farm. Pinot’s love of the happy-hooved creatures was made even more public in 2018, in the lead-up to the Road World Championships, when he created a 208 km-long piece of Strava artwork in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/5352/thibaut-pinot-draws-a-208km-goat-with-a-strava-ride\">the shape of a goat</a>.</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-kZH6PnRGD/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" id=\"instagram-media-payload-1\"></blockquote><p>Anyway. Everyone on the farm appears to be having the best time, all the time, and every wholesome post on the page sends a small but detectable spark of joy out into this troubled world.</p><p>As word got out about Thibaut’s menagerie, the page quickly took on a life of its own. There are now 16,000 followers of the Instagram account, and Thibaut has roped in his Groupama-FDJ teammates for farm visits, which, obviously, j’adore.&nbsp;</p><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CFW77-XH6d0/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" id=\"instagram-media-payload-2\"></blockquote><p>Pinot tumbled out of contention in his major 2020 season goal, the Tour de France, getting caught up in a massive crash on stage 1 and losing 25 minutes on the first mountain stage.</p><p>The known goat-fancier battled through to finish the race in 29th overall&nbsp;–&nbsp;some way off his career-best third place, but better than the devastating 2019 result that plunged France into national mourning and inspired the dirge-y folk song <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/66hOk17PsacZ7Ou1TF228f?si=CHDo9JrWRCW56f6af4zj4A&amp;utm_source=copy-link\">‘Tibopino’ by Jaune Mayo</a> (two followers, 15 monthly listeners, but let’s blow it up for the boys).&nbsp;</p><p>Pinot’s off-season was gainfully spent securing a casualwear merchandising deal with French apparel manufacturer, <a href=\"https://ref-store.fr/shop/?filtering=1&amp;filter_collection=pinot\">ref.</a> Happily, Thibaut’s goats make an appearance on a selection of fashionable sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and even baby onesies.&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"742\" src=\"data:image/image/png;base64,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\" data-src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-2.15.43-pm-1340x742.png\" alt=\"\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-2.15.43-pm-1340x742.png 1340w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-2.15.43-pm-650x360.png 650w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-2.15.43-pm-190x105.png 190w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-2.15.43-pm-1080x598.png 1080w, https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-25-at-2.15.43-pm-16x9.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\"><figcaption>Fig. 1: Shut up and take my money.</figcaption></figure><p>I am certainly not immune to Thibaut’s charms, so the fact that I can now buy a range of goat-featuring Team Thibaut gear –&nbsp;if I want to, which I absolutely do – makes me disproportionately pleased.&nbsp;</p><p>And if a €29 ethically-sourced and ecologically-sound T-shirt with a Thibaut Pinot goat on it isn’t your jam?
