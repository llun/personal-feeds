When the unlock happens, the user receives a haptic buzz and a notification on the Apple Watch informing them that the unlocking procedure has been successful. However, bear in mind that you can only use your Apple Watch to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ while wearing a mask – it can't be used for authenticating <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases.</p><p>Before you can take advantage of the new feature, you'll need to make sure that you're running either a developer beta or the public betas of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4. You'll need the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch profiles from <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/\">Apple's beta testing website</a>, and after you have them installed, you can update on ‌iPhone‌ by going to <strong>Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Software Update</strong>.
