For Apple smartphone owners, that would include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 6s and 6s Plus and newer devices. The watchdog has filed its legal claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will ultimately decide if it can go ahead.<br></p><blockquote><p>\"We believe Qualcomm's practices are anti-competitive and have so far taken around £480m from consumers' pockets,\" said Anabel Hoult, CEO of Which? \"This needs to stop. We are sending a clear warning that if companies like Qualcomm indulge in manipulative practices which harm consumers, Which? is prepared to take action.\"</p></blockquote><p>Responding to the case, Qualcomm said it had \"no basis.\"<br></p><blockquote><p>\"As the plaintiffs are well aware, their claims were effectively put to rest last summer by a unanimous panel of judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States,\" a spokesman told the BBC.</p></blockquote><p>This is by no means the first time that Qualcomm has been accused of anticompetitive behavior. In 2018, Qualcomm was hit with a 997 million euro ($1.2 billion) fine by EU antitrust regulators for paying Apple to use its LTE chips in iOS devices.</p><p>According to the European Commission's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/24/eu-fines-qualcomm-for-paying-apple-chip-deals/\">investigation</a>, the payments to Apple occurred from 2011 to 2016, and were made with the sole aim of blocking Qualcomm's LTE chipset market rivals, such as Intel.</p><p>In 2019, an antitrust lawsuit, brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/22/ftc-wins-antitrust-lawsuit-against-qualcomm/\">concluded</a> that Qualcomm's \"no license, no chips\" model that allowed it to refuse to provide chips to companies without a patent license, violated federal antitrust laws, and required Qualcomm to renegotiate all of its licensing terms with customers in good faith.</p><p>However, in August 2020, Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/11/qualcomm-wins-appeal-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/\">won an appeal</a> that prevented the San Diego company from having to renegotiate its licensing agreements with smartphone makers.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">Kuo: New MacBook Pro Models With HDMI Port and SD Card Reader to Launch Later This Year</a></h3><p>Monday February 22, 2021 8:52 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple plans to release two new MacBook Pro models equipped with an HDMI port and SD card reader in the second half of 2021, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who outlined his expectations in a research note obtained by MacRumors.
