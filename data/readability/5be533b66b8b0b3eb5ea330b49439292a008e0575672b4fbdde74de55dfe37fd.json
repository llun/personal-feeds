For winter shoes, they do a good job of not looking bulky.<p>Lake has done a lot to keep the cold, wind and wet away. The toe box is lined with 200g 3M Thinsulate lining and surrounded by a waterproof membrane, while the Clarino Microfibre outer is treated with a DWR (durable water-resistant) coating. These tighten with a combination of an IP1 Boa dial and a single reflective Velcro strap.</p><p>The outsole is made from a fibreglass injected nylon material rather than the more expensive carbon fibre sole Lake uses on some of its shoes. Theyâ€™re compatible with three-hole road cleats and feature rubber bumpers that unfortunately are not replaceable.</p><p>According to Lake, the shoes are comfortable down to -3Â°C, though weâ€™ll soon see about that for ourselves. Keep your eyes peeled for a full review on these very soon.</p><ul><li>Â£155 / $199</li></ul><div data-position=\"adhoc\"><h5>Latest deals</h5></div><h2>JRC Components Zen Ride wallet</h2><ul><li data-type=\"in-text\" data-config=\"{&quot;nameKeywords&quot;: &quot;JRC Components Zen Ride wallet&quot;, &quot;priceMin&quot;: 22, &quot;sid&quot;: &quot;post-bikeradar-614427-its-txt-pos&quot;}\" data-text=\"<b>Buy now</b> from {merchant} ({price}), {merchant} ({price}) and {merchant} ({price}).\" data-checked=\"true\"></li></ul>Sized to slot perfectly into a standard rear jersey pocket, the 125g Zen Ride wallet from JRC Components is a great way to make the most of your clothingâ€™s storage space.<p>There are neat compartments to take your phone (usually with a protective case in place too), debit/credit cards, coins and keys and even room for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-tyre-levers/\">tyre levers</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/6-of-the-best-co2-inflators/\">Co2 canister</a>.</p><p>Itâ€™s made from 600D polyester and uses an oversized zip for easy access even with thick winter gloves on.</p><ul><li>â‚¬26.95</li><li><a href=\"https://www.jrc-components.com/products/zen-ride-wallet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy the Zen Ride wallet direct from JRC Components</a></li></ul><h2>SKS Airspy SV tyre pressure monitoring system</h2>SKS has got in on the tyre pressure monitoring game with its Airspy range.<p>The SKS Airspy piggybacks onto a tyreâ€™s valve stem and transmits real-time information on your tyre pressures via Bluetooth or ANT+ to either a free smartphone app or a compatible Garmin device.</p><p>Inside the app, a traffic light system dictates whether or not your tyres require inflation with an audible alarm being prompted at the app should the system detect a slow puncture.</p><p>When the time comes to add more pressure, the system doubles up as a digital pressure gauge and can also generate pressure recommendations based on values you give it.</p><p>Different versions are available for Presta and Schrader valves, with the aforementioned being tubeless compatible.</p><p>Each sensor secures against a spoke using one of four provided â€˜U-locksâ€™ and is powered by a single coin style CR2032 battery.

Unlike the TyreWiz, the Airspy doesnâ€™t offer the ability to run the system without a smartphone or compatible Garmin device.</p><p>Â£109.99 / â‚¬99.99 / $144.99</p></section></div>","author":"Oli Woodman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5be533b66b8b0b3eb5ea330b49439292a008e0575672b4fbdde74de55dfe37fd","category":"Cycling"}
