{"title":"How much do riders and teams make at the Tour de France?","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/how-much-prize-money-is-on-offer-at-the-tour-de-france/","date":1625546908000,"content":"<div><p></p><h4>At the 2020 Tour de France, Tadej Pogačar scooped the yellow jersey, the polka dot jersey, the best young rider jersey, and a sweet payday for his team.</h4><p></p><div><p>The <a href=\"http://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> is the glittering jewel in the cycling crown, the sport’s most polished and prestigious production. Each year it is broadcast around the world to an audience of countless millions. It is cycling’s World Cup, Eurovision Song Contest, and Grand Final rolled into one.</p><p>But does that vast global audience equate to vast prize money? </p><p>It depends how you look at it.</p><p>The 2021 Tour de France has a total prize pool of €2,228,450 (US$2,642,340 / AU$3,516,770) – around €60,000 less than it has been in the last two editions. </p><p>For mere mortals like you and me, that is a considerable sum. But compared to other major sports, it’s pretty modest prize money. Take as an example the Wimbledon tennis tournament, with a prize pool of £35,000,000<strong> </strong>(€40,799,650), from which the men’s and women’s singles winners will each pocket a novelty-sized cheque for £1,700,000 (€1,981,697).</p><p>As for the Tour? For three weeks of exertion, the general classification winner will take home €500,000, a snazzy bowl-shaped trophy, and a soft toy in the shape of a lion. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kramon_TourDeFrance2020_st6_03144-1340x893.jpg\"><figcaption>Awarded to the holder of the yellow jersey each day, the stuffed lion is the <em>real</em> prize of the Tour de France.</figcaption></figure><p>The prize money drops off sharply from there, divided between the rest of the riders in the race. The second-place finisher gets €200,000, but by the time you get down to 19th on the general classification, the winnings are just €1,100  – enough for a pair of titanium eeWings cranks and a round of Domino’s pizza (but only from the extra-value range – nothing fancy) for the whole team. Riders from 20th to 160th are rewarded with €1,000 each; €47 for each day of the race.  </p><p>But it’s not just that final big (or small) payday in Paris that the riders are jostling for.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kramon_TourDeFrance2020_st21_15969-1340x876.jpg\"><figcaption>Sam Bennett on his way to a stage win and a maillot vert in Paris, 2020.</figcaption></figure><p>The total prize pool is sliced and diced across the entire race, in intermediate sprints and stage wins, mountain summits and combativity prizes. Euros are an abstract thing, but tangible real life items are not, so CyclingTips has helpfully decided to provide real-life comparisons of what riders could buy with their prize money for each of these.</p><p>A stage win at the Tour de France is good for €11,000 – not quite enough for an S-Works Aethos. Tenth on a stage will net a rider a more modest €600 – enough for a pair of titanium CeramicSpeed jockey wheels – while 15th to 20th place is, in financial terms, no different: €300, or not quite enough for the shoes on the riders’ feet. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cavendish-tour-de-france-win-1-of-2-1340x803.jpg\"><figcaption>Mark Cavendish at the moment of earning €11,000.</figcaption></figure><p>The points on a sprint stage, meanwhile, contribute toward the green jersey, the wearer of which pockets €300 per day, with the eventual winner of that classification taking home €25,000. Likewise, if a rider places at an intermediate sprint, there’s a financial incentive in addition to the points. The winner scores €1,500, and the third-place finisher earns more than just the fleeting admiration of their peers: they pick up €500, which is enough for a <a href=\"https://www.ooyyo.com/france/c=CDA31D7114D2854F111BFB6FBAFB355B13A11D6617CB864111/-4431642467060602231.html/\" target=\"_blank\">very well-soiled 2002 Renault Twingo</a> (with €10 spare for service station snacks on the way back from collecting it in Marseilles).</p><p>Like the green jersey winner, the final holder of the King of the Mountains Classification is also rewarded with €25,000, with monetary prizes for every single categorised climb in the race. These vary from €5,000 for the Souvenir Henri Desgrange – the highest point of the race, at the Port d’Envalira on stage 15 – all the way down to €200 for a fourth category climb. If a rider strings together a couple of those, they might be able to put it toward <a href=\"https://hypoxico.eu/altitude-training-simulation-equipment/p/head-altitude-tent\">a discreet altitude tent for the head</a> (a steal at €360).</p><p>All of this prize money is tallied up over three weeks, pooling in the team’s piggy bank. As cycling is a team sport, it’s customary for the total to be split among riders and staff, meaning Tadej Pogačar (to choose one entirely hypothetical winner of this year’s race off the top of my head) won’t take the full half-mil home to Slovenia. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Kramon_TourDeFrance2020_st21_15395-1340x924.jpg\"><figcaption>Teamwork makes the dream work.</figcaption></figure><p>As of the first rest day, it’s team classification leader Bahrain Victorious that is heading the running prize money tally, courtesy of a couple of stage wins and some busy bees in various breakaways. Way down the other end of the spectrum is poor Qhubeka-NextHash, which has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/whats-the-story-behind-nexthash-team-qhubekas-mysterious-new-sponsor/\">brought on a cryptocurrency sponsor</a> for the event but pocketed little real-world cash. At present, they’re sitting on enough for a team-bonding RyanAir trip to Zagreb for the Tour squad and 10 staff.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><span>Team</span></th><th><span>Prize money (</span><span>€)</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>1</span></td><td><span>Bahrain Victorious</span></td><td><span>56,800</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>2</span></td><td><span>Deceuninck-QuickStep</span></td><td><span>51,880</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>3</span></td><td><span>Alpecin-Fenix</span></td><td><span>46,360</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>4</span></td><td><span>Jumbo-Visma</span></td><td><span>29,310</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>5</span></td><td><span>UAE Team Emirates</span></td><td><span>27,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>6</span></td><td><span>AG2R Citroën Team</span></td><td><span>21,780</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>7</span></td><td><span>Team Arkea-Samsic</span></td><td><span>14,790</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>8</span></td><td><span>Trek-Segafredo</span></td><td><span>13,630</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>9</span></td><td><span>Bora-Hansgrohe</span></td><td><span>12,060</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>10</span></td><td><span>Team BikeExchange</span></td><td><span>11,910</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>11</span></td><td><span>Groupama-FDJ</span></td><td><span>9,180</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>12</span></td><td><span>Astana-Premier Tech</span></td><td><span>8,390</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>13</span></td><td><span>EF Education-Nippo</span></td><td><span>8,060</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>14</span></td><td><span>Lotto Soudal</span></td><td><span>7,970</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>15</span></td><td><span>Israel Start-Up Nation</span></td><td><span>5,030</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>16</span></td><td><span>B&amp;B Hotels p/b KTM</span></td><td><span>5,010</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>17</span></td><td><span>Cofidis</span></td><td><span>4,750</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>18</span></td><td><span>Ineos Grenadiers</span></td><td><span>3,930</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>19</span></td><td><span>Team DSM</span></td><td><span>3,910</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>20</span></td><td><span>Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux</span></td><td><span>3,750</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>21</span></td><td><span>Movistar Team</span></td><td><span>3,660</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>22</span></td><td><span>TotalEnergies</span></td><td><span>2,900</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>23</span></td><td><span>Qhubeka-NextHash</span></td><td><span>1,840</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As for the riders contributing to those team pools?
