For third-party advertising purposes, Google collects data that includes location, search history, and browsing history. Google's own marketing data includes all of the above information along with contact info and device identifiers, plus there's even more data collected for analytics, app functionality, and product personalization.</p><p>DuckDuckGo claims that Google \"wanted to hide\" the information that it collects, which is why Google took so long to roll out support for App Privacy labels. Most people are likely not surprised at the extent of the data that Google collects, but having it in one spot in the ‌App Store‌ is a stark reminder.</p><p>Many of Google's major apps did not start getting privacy labels <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/\">until late in February</a>, even though Apple's rule went into effect in December. Google delayed adding the labels for so long that its apps went more than two months without being updated. Even now, it's been three months since the Google Maps app has been updated, though most other apps have now received App Privacy labels and updates.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search and browser option that's available on iOS devices and that can be set as the default search engine option. As DuckDuckGo points out in its tweet, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361\">the DuckDuckGo app</a> does not collect data that's linked to you.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">iPhone 13 Models Will 'Likely' Have Touch ID Under the Display</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models slated for release later this year will \"likely\" feature a fingerprint scanner embedded under the display for authentication, in addition to Face ID, according to Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner and three of his colleagues.
