href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/189084529/litelok-core-tough-portable-lock-for-bikes-and-motorcycles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kickstarter now</a> for about 30% off the ultimate retail pricing. <em>And it’s already been met its funding goal in the first hours since it went live.</em></p><p>That means you can get a shot at a limited number of Litelok Core locks from £80 (~$110 / 100€) starting today, with delivery slated for about two months from now in May 2021. You get to pick from four bike-specific lengths and three colors, or even a twin pack that shares the same keys and can be daisy-chained together.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.litelok.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Litelok.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"73f4393b14291786d2b254a6df05895cbbeacd8c0bc8c890ebb022d1bd4ec111","category":"Cycling"}
