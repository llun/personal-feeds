Still, it's notable that the app itself has seen its first update since December 7, as Google has typically pushed updates for the YouTube app every week or two.</p><p>Many other major Google apps like Google, Google Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Meet have still not been updated and do not have privacy information displayed on their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> listings. Google-owned Waze did finally update its iOS app a few days ago, adding privacy information as part of the update as required by Apple.</p><p>Google has denied that it is holding back iOS app updates in order to delay revealing its privacy practices, but many users have found that hard to believe considering the sudden slowing of app updates coinciding with Apple's disclosure deadline and continued updates for Google's various Android apps.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Gmail iOS app even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/\">began displaying \"out of date\" warnings</a> when trying to add a new account, even though there is no new version of the app available and there have been no updates to the Gmail iOS app since December 1.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/buyers-guide-dont-buy-macbook-pro-now/\">Buyerâ€™s Guide: Don't Buy a MacBook Pro Now</a></h3><p>New MacBook Pro models are expected to arrive later this year with some of the biggest improvements to the product line to date, including some surprising changes, so now is not the best time to buy a new MacBook Pro.
