So this week, instead of ordering with Atoms, we would encourage you to <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/aoc-social-20210219?refcode=atomsdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support relief efforts in Texas</a>.</p><p>And while you are at it, do read the story at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidraqasim/status/1354922768219992065\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Humans of New York</a>, it is a bit long, but right in the sweet spot you all like. Thanks</p></span></p></div>","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4716dd72b6c1c77d1e8db1da8c1d118988aad9662bd594ed852c226b4d4bcfdc","category":"Tech"}
