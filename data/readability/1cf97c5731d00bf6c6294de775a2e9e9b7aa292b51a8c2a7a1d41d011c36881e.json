Notably, Apple says it will only collect anonymized and encrypted data from users when the \"Routing and Traffic\" setting is turned on within Location Services -&gt; System Services.</p><p>Currently, ‌Apple Maps‌ offers no front-facing interface for displaying this data to users. The lack of the feature on the visual front and Apple's wording implies that Apple is testing and collecting data to potentially launch a related feature in the official public release of iOS 14.5, or perhaps in a release subsequent to it.</p><p><img alt=\"IMG 0743\" width=\"1283\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/GA9H_8wpMxg0jQVMPis2iagMgsc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/GA9H_8wpMxg0jQVMPis2iagMgsc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/GA9H_8wpMxg0jQVMPis2iagMgsc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Wuk-7Olz_VpUHpaOsU0nxVB-R44=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/oeOD6bYSPy2LurK8govvTFFQfKo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/cLWHNDFyqjT_Rue8-AOeTLeBXVc=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/GA9H_8wpMxg0jQVMPis2iagMgsc=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/Wuk-7Olz_VpUHpaOsU0nxVB-R44=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/oeOD6bYSPy2LurK8govvTFFQfKo=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/cLWHNDFyqjT_Rue8-AOeTLeBXVc=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/IMG_0743.jpg 2500w\"></p><p><em>Google Maps Live Crowd Data</em></p><p>Google Maps already offers a similar real-time feature called <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/6263531?hl=en-GB\">Live Visit Data</a> that informs users of how busy a specific store or business is at a particular time.
