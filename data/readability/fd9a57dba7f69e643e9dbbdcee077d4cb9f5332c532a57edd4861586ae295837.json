That company is now known as Velocraft. Pictured is Gardner’s own commuter/gravel steed, a Curve GXR Kevin with paint inspired by 1950s Chevrolet Bel Airs.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VeloCraft-Curve-GXR-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Velocraft arguably had its team’s skills on display more than any other marker at the show. Bastion, Prova, TOR, Curve and The Lost Workshop all displayed bikes painted by Velocraft.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VeloCraft-Curve-GXR-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-3-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Velocraft shares a building with Bastion and Prova Cycles. The mechanic responsible for this build, Dan at Superbe Velo Service, also works from the same building.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VeloCraft-Curve-GXR-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-4-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>There are some impressive details in this frame. For example, there are a few engraved markings in the raw titanium.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/VeloCraft-Curve-GXR-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-5-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Curve GXR features a machined yoke for chainring and tyre clearance.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-1-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>TOR Bikes is a custom steel frame brand based in Beechworth within Victoria’s High Country. The area is known for its mountain biking, and that’s exactly TOR’s main focus. Here’s a customer’s fresh trail bike built with 130 mm of travel and 29er wheels. This bike will get its own write-up on Pinkbike shortly.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-7-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This customer bike was given the full Velocraft paint treatment. That includes a painted-to-match fork, stem, and even rim decals.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-9-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Shane Flint runs TOR Bikes and has recently turned his torch to creating gravel bikes, too. Pictured is a local customer’s bike with a theme that pays homage to Mt Pilot near Beechworth.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-11-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The saddle is covered by Busyman and has “Wooragee” (the name of a locality near Mt Pilot) embossed in the leather.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-10-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Bar tape is from Busyman, too.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-12-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The paint is yet another Velocraft creation and is based on the local terrain.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TOR-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-13-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>A closer look reveals a subtle gold spec in the “sandstone” sections of the paint. Back in the 1850s, the region was booming following the discovery of gold.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Auren-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-1-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Auren Bikes is a young custom brand based in Melbourne. Standing at two metres tall (6′ 6″), William Young founded the company after struggling to find affordable custom bikes to fit himself.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Auren-Bikes-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Auren Bikes are fitted and designed locally but manufacturing is outsourced to a titanium specialist in Asia. This is reflected in the low price (complete framesets, including custom geometry, fork and headset, start from AU$3,830). This particular customer bike was built with an FSA ACR headset for internal cable routing, but the parts supply of suitable forks is tight at the moment.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/G-Duke-Bicycles-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-1-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Looking for a steel frame repair in Melbourne? Geoff Duke, of G.Duke Bicycles, is your person. G.Duke specialises in custom steel bikes.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/G-Duke-Bicycles-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This is Duke’s personal disc road bike. It features a lug construction which is quite impressive when you consider nobody currently makes lugs for tapered head tubes. The lug you see here was beaten into shape with a hammer over a mandrel that Duke made himself. A frameset like this one will cost AU$4,500 with a Columbus carbon fork and custom geometry.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/G-Duke-Bicycles-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-3-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>In addition to lugged steel frames, Duke also produces lugged steel stems. Reach out to him if you’re looking for an old quill stem to match a well-loved ride.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Penny-Farthing-Dan-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-6-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Here’s something you don’t see every day. Dan Bolwell of Penny Farthing Dan is a specialist maker in the high-wheeler space and his creations are built to be ridden and raced. According to Bolwell, there’s one customer who racks up over 20,000 km a year on their Penny Farthing Dan.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Penny-Farthing-Dan-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-1-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption><p>“From my perspective, I feel like I’ve taken what the engineers did in 1890 where they left off … and taken further,” Bolwell said.</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Penny-Farthing-Dan-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-3-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption><p>“There is no common manufacturer of any parts, the rims are my creation, the frame tubing is mine. Even the saddles and handlebars are made in-house,” said Bolwell of making a penny farthing in Australia. “So the work you need to get to be at this level is extensive. It’s a life dedication and a big investment. “</p></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Penny-Farthing-Dan-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>There is a staggering amount of detail in Bowell’s bikes. He even extrudes his own tyres!</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Penny-Farthing-Dan-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-4-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Bolwell clearly has a deep passion for all things bicycle but has dedicated his life to creating penny farthings. According to Bolwell, he makes approximately 50 of them a year and exports to over 20 countries.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Penny-Farthing-Dan-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-5-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Penny Farthing Dan had two 52″- and one 54″-wheeled bikes on display. “Because I manufacturer the rims there is no limitation on me. I’ll do kids bikes that are only 28″, and recently I did one that is 85”. That was a display in a restaurant. It is rideable; you could ride it across Australia if you wanted to, you’d just have to be 11 ft tall,” said Bolwell with a contagious smile.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Cortado-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-1-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Few makers in the world offer Baum Cycles’ attention to detail. Pictured is the Cortado that has long sat on the company’s Secret Menu: “If you know about it, you can buy it,” said Darren Baum. The Cortado will likely be re-released in the future and aims to replicate the golden era of steel frames when ride quality was the absolute focus. This one is built with a polished stainless steel rear end and an assorted mix of thin steel tubes on the front. This bike is built with a handful of new-old-stock Campagnolo parts collected by the customer who sought to build what’s effectively their dream bike from when they raced in the ’90s.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Cortado-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This bike is something quite special. It’ll be covered in more detail with a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/bikes-of-the-bunch/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes of the Bunch</a> feature in the near future.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-1-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>This Orbis + belongs to Darren Baum himself. As pictured, it’s set up in commuter mode, but Baum suggests it spends more time with 40 mm gravel tyres and a power meter.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-2-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>The Orbis + is Baum’s do-it-all titanium road model designed for mixing it up on gravel and road. Some would call it an all-road bike, while others would say it’s a gravel race bike. Baum just says it’s a modern road bike.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-3-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Baum does its own painting in-house. The quality is flawless.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-4-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Baum’s own Orbis + is fitted with some rather special fenders. Enve makes a carbon fender to match its fork, but oddly doesn’t offer a matching one for the rear. And so Baum collaborated with nearby <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/05/partington-39r-44r-1150g-disc-brake-wheels-first-look/\" target=\"_blank\">Partington</a> to produce something that matched the front.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-6-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Bastion is contracted to 3D-print the titanium ends.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-5-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Partington makes the carbon blades, Enve makes the struts, and Baum handles the paint. Want a pair? Well, you’ll have to buy an Orbis +. “It might be a bit of an over-the-top mudguard,” Baum said with a grin.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-7-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Baum machines its own head tubes in house.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Baum-Orbis-Handmade-Bicycle-Show-Australia-2021-CyclingTips-8-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>2021 spells 25 years for Baum Cycles. You can expect some interesting collaborations in celebration of this anniversary.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><p><em>Note: Some images in this series close crowds of people who aren’t wearing masks.
