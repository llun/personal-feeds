Looking at the weight of the Santini Adapt jacket before my first ride I opted for my warmest base layer. Weighing just 354g, compact feeling and billed as 'mid-weight', I was expecting to be on the chilly side with the outdoor temperature around 8C.</p><p>Bad choice. By the time I’d hit the first hill I was uncomfortably overheated and reaching for the zip pull to let more air in. The Adapt jacket is impressively warm for its bulk.</p><p>That’s down to its fabric mix, with front-facing panels that include a windproof membrane sandwiched between a water-resistant outer layer and an inside face that’s a mix of merino wool and synthetics.</p>&nbsp;<p>That explains the good warmth-to-weight, although there’s a bit more airflow through the fabric than with some winter jackets, so that the Adapt jacket doesn’t feel damp if you do work up a sweat.</p><p>The three layer laminate fabric extends over the shoulders and half way down the back. There's a more breathable, fleecier synthetic pile fabric used for the middle section, which ups airflow, again making for comfort while working hard.</p><p>The rear side also includes a wide reflective strip mid-back which slightly overlaps the fleece and is sewn into it at the centreline. It’s a slightly odd-looking construction but might help with airflow and positions the reflectives well, where they’re in the line of sight.</p>&nbsp;<p>There’s a reflective Santini logo on the front breast too.</p><p>Pocket-wise, the centre one is a bit wider than those at the sides, useful for those extra odds and ends that a cold weather ride necessitates. In addition, there’s a zipped breast pocket that’s handy for keys or a phone.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.probikekit.co.uk/sports-clothing/santini-adapt-mid-weight-jacket/12698809.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Santini Adapt jacket from ProBikeKit now</strong></em></a></p>&nbsp;<p>I liked that Santini has put a really large, ring-shaped puller on the Adapt jacket, which makes adjusting airflow really easy when wearing heavier gloves. There’s a fleecy backer for the zip which helps keep chilly breezes out too.</p><p>The cuffs are stretchy and ribbed and do a really good job of keeping breezes out of the sleeves. The neckline of the Santini Adapt jacket is made of the same fabric.</p><p>It’s quite low cut though, so a bit of a breeze found its way down the front. It’s not a major problem and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/4255/buyer-s-guide-best-cycling-neckwarmers\">a neckwarmer</a> added plenty of extra warmth on days which were a bit chillier.</p>&nbsp;<p>Fit-wise the Santini Adapt jacket is close but comfortable, with enough room and stretch that you can layer up underneath if you do decide you need that thicker base layer, but without rucking or excess fabric to flap around in the wind.</p><p>There’s plenty of length too – a nice-to-have for decent overlap with tights to prevent chills. The stretchy bottom seam with a silicone gripper makes sure that the jacket stays in place well.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.probikekit.co.uk/sports-clothing/santini-adapt-mid-weight-jacket/12698809.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Santini Adapt jacket from ProBikeKit now</strong></em></a></p><p>At £185, the Santini Adapt jacket isn’t cheap, although it’s currently discounted on Santini’s UK site. But I reckon it’s a piece that you could expect to get good usage of in the typical UK cusp-season weather and on milder winter rides.</p><p>Who knows, you might even find that you wear it with that thick base layer in the depths of winter.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"f7ab7cd387ef1de4e27d76d285ee4a4295ba959143fc242efe6d62a57a393fed","category":"Cycling"}
