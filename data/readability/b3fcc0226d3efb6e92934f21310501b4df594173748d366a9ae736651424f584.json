In the eight-episode second season of \"Trying,\" Apple says couple Nikki (played by Smith) and Jason (played by Spall) continue to navigate the child adoption process.</p><p>Apple:</p><blockquote><p>Having been approved by the adoption panel, they now find that matching with a child is not as straightforward as they had hoped. It seems like children are being snapped up by other couples while somehow they're being left behind. Helped by their eccentric social worker Penny (Imelda Staunton), they are determined to do everything they can. When Nikki meets a little girl called Princess at an adoption event, she knows instantly that this is the child for them. But there are obstacles to Nikki's plan that may prove insurmountable.</p></blockquote><p>\"Trying\" is created, written, and executive produced by Andy Wolton. The series is produced by BBC Studios.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\">Apple Adds FaceTime Framework to Apple TV/HomePod Amid Speaker With Screen Rumors</a></h3><p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today revealed that Apple has been developing new speakers that are equipped with \"screens and cameras,\" suggesting we could see a future HomePod-like device that has a built-in display and camera feature for FaceTiming and other functions.
