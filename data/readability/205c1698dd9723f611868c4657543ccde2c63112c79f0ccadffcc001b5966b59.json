The online store also stated that the iMac Pro as offered would be available \"while supplies last.\" This led to suspicions that the product was not long for this world.</p><p>Shortly afterward, various outlets including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/the-imac-pro-is-being-discontinued/\">TechCrunch received confirmation</a> from Apple that these changes do indeed indicate that the product has been discontinued.</p><p>The 27-inch iMac Pro had not been updated in a significant way since it was first introduced back in 2017. And since then, the priciest configurations of the normal 27-inch iMac have given the iMac Pro a run for its money in terms of performance and features.</p><p>To that point, Apple says that the non-Pro 27-inch iMac is the most popular iMac, and the expensive but powerful Mac Pro is available for those who need more powerful hardware for certain use cases.</p><p>Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/2020-27-inch-imac-review-a-classic-mac-for-the-end-of-an-era/\">updated the 27-inch iMac</a> last summer, shortly after announcing that the entire Mac product line would transition from Intel CPUs to Apple's own custom-designed silicon.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=9hGJlFio\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/report-magsafe-will-return-in-new-apple-silicon-macbook-pro-models/\">others</a> have cited people familiar with Apple's plans to report that the company expects to update the iMac with a new design and Apple Silicon processors later this year, along with similar updates to the MacBook Pro and a newly redesigned MacBook Air.</p><p>The Mac Pro is not expected to get an Apple Silicon version until sometime next year, and some reports have indicated that a smaller Apple Silicon Mac Pro may for at least a while coexist with the larger Intel-based tower PC.</p><p><em>Listing image by Samuel Axon</em></p></div></div>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"205c1698dd9723f611868c4657543ccde2c63112c79f0ccadffcc001b5966b59","category":"Tech"}
