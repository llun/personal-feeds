But this year with Surface Laptop 4, WinFuture says that Ryzen 5 4680U and Ryzen 7 4980U \"Surface Edition\" CPUs—lightly modified for Microsoft's tight vertical integration—will be available in the smaller 13.5-inch Surface laptops as well.</p><p>Both Ryzen processors include Vega integrated graphics, and the Surface models are expected to include RAM up to 16GiB and SSD up to 512GB—though no word yet on whether the latter two will be socketed or soldered. These Ryzen models will be competing with Intel i5-1145G7 and i7-1185G7 Tiger Lake CPUs with Iris Plus 950 graphics; the Tiger Lake models are expected to offer up to 32GiB RAM and 1TB SSD.</p><p>We should stress that, so far, this is still rumor—this information is based solely on a spec sheet WinFuture says it received from an unnamed dealer. Assuming the rumors pan out, this is good news for anyone who wants a heavier multicore punch in a new Surface Laptop.</p></div></div>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"63676944e864e5361862003d9ec383da84bba139493d8258a1dfb6bea1ab717e","category":"Tech"}
