The app combines Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and a number of mobile device-specific features, including PDF management tools and a file browser.</p><p>A year ago almost to the day, Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/microsoft-releases-new-all-in-one-office-app-for-ios-and-android/\">released</a> this update to iPhones and Android phones, and the update has appeared on some Android tablets as well. As an iPhone app, it previously ran on iPads but only in a windowed mode of sorts. This new version has a full-screen tablet interface and supports various iPad multitasking features.</p><p>Users can still download individual Word, Excel, or PowerPoint apps in the iPad's App Store; the standalone apps and this all-in-one option seem likely to coexist at least for a while, as the standalone alternatives haven't gone away on the iPhone.</p><p>Apart from making working between the three productivity apps a little more seamless, the app's main value proposition is the \"Actions\" panel. In it, users can access quick-action icons to transfer files between devices, convert images to text or tables, sign or scan PDFs, convert PDFs to word, scan QR codes, and do a few other things. The full list is pictured in the gallery above.</p><p>Users can access files stored locally on the device, in the cloud via OneDrive, or in iCloud.</p><p>The app is available for download today in the App Store for free, but it requires a Microsoft 365 subscription to access all features.</p><p>iPad manufacturer Apple has been making significant software and hardware changes to make the iPad a fully viable desktop or laptop replacement, including branching iOS off into a new, iPad specific version named iPadOS. In our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/ipados-review-the-ipad-is-dead-long-live-the-ipad/\">reviews of iPadOS</a>, we have found the operating system functional and sometimes even exceptional, but many frustrations still remain.</p><p>Apple is expected to debut a new iPad Pro in the next few months, and it may add more productivity features with that hardware update.</p><p><em>Listing image by Samuel Axon</em></p></div></div>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a1c4482f432a84aa45952fe131e6b41e7d3df008c1954e4fa3ba8c45c8229cd","category":"Tech"}
