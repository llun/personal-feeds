Hutchinson says they’ve been developing the new reinforcement technology for their made-in-France tires for the past two years with the goal of improving all-around sustainability, with overall performance improvements providing welcome added benefits.</p><h2>Hutchinson Gridskin sustainable road &amp; gravel tire reinforcement</h2><p><a

But from the production photos we’ve seen, it appears the mesh is simply wrapped around the core 127tpi casing, just before the rubber layer is laid over the mold to be vulcanized. The previous Hardskin system appears to have been adhered to the casing in a more complex multi-part process before the rubber was vulcanized on the tire.&nbsp;Hutchinson says it’s a reduction of four steps down to just one to reinforce the tires, reducing material waste, time, and extra energy to produce – “<em>less plastic, less rubber, and less electricity</em>“.</p><p>The Gridskin result is improved puncture &amp; cut protection, (<em>sometimes</em>) lighter weight, more supple construction, and a more sustainable process overall.</p><h3>Limited edition Hutchinson Fusion 5 road &amp; Touareg gravel Gridskin tires</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view.jpg\" alt=\"Hutchinson Gridskin lightweight reinforced sustainable gravel road bike tire\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/22120942/Hutchinson-Gridskin-lightweight-reinforced-sustainable-gravel-road-bike-tire_view-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>In the end, the Gridskin tires get something of a snakeskin-like texture to the sidewalls.
