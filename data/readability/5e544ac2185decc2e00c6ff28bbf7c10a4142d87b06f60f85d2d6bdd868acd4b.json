We spotted unmarked, low-profile wheels while watching a wet Stage 9, as the riders got their biggest-yet mountain stage and the first beyond classification climb of the Grand Tour near the Swiss &amp; Italian border. And after news just last week of a development partnership between Scope &amp; DSM, we’re pretty sure these will be some unreleased lightweight Scope prototype wheels that should be coming

With no visible tubular base tape and visible nuts on the valves, this is almost certainly a road tubeless setup.</p><p>That’s a big step away from cotton tubulars, but could likely explain the comment about marginal performance gains, combined with improved safety due to the purported lower rolling resistance and decreased occurrence of flat tires with tubeless?</p><figure
