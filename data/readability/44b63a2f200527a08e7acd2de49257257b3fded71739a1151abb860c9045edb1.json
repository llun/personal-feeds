Could this be the end of the tyranny of having to push buttons to open the garage door? I was excited to put the iQ3 to the test to find out.</p><p>The hardware itself is unobtrusive and familiar: a small black box that sits near your garage door opener and connects via a pair of wires to the motor. The Tailwind app is reasonably helpful at guiding you through this process, as well as alerting you as to whether your door is compatible with the smart controller out of the box. (Like almost all smart garage door controllers, newer-model openers require an adapter that will work with encrypted open/close signals; you’ll need to email the company to obtain a free one.)</p><blockquote><p><em>This review is part of TechHive’s coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3518534/the-best-smart-garage-door-controller.html\">the best smart garage door controllers</a>, where you’ll find reviews of the competition’s offerings, plus a buyer’s guide to the features you should consider when shopping for this type of product.</em></p></blockquote><p>Like the <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3600588/meross-smart-wi-fi-garage-door-opener-review.html\">Meross</a> series of controllers, the Tailwind iQ3 relies on a wired door sensor instead of the more common wireless sensor. While this offers arguably better reliability, it does complicate installation quite a bit, requiring you to run a wire along the top of the opener track to the door and mounting a magnetic sensor somewhere along the door frame.</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_8d33810871b278975458c32355f253f4\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01ezsbaaastgxy0k321nhayda2\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-garage-door-controller-100879198-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Tailwind</div>\n<p>As with similar smart garage door controllers, the Tailwind iQ3 mounts on or near your garage door opener and gets wired to it.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"tailwind garage door controller\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-imageid=\"100879198\" data-license=\"Supplied Art\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-garage-door-controller-100879198-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-garage-door-controller-100879198-large.jpg\"></a><small>Tailwind</small><figcaption><p>As with similar smart garage door controllers, the Tailwind iQ3 mounts on or near your garage door opener and gets wired to it.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Also like the Meross line, the iQ3 supports up to three doors with a single controller, which will necessitate running multiple sets of wires around your garage.

This depends on your car being outfitted with a Bluetooth radio (not a steep requirement for cars built in the last 10 years or so), and you having Tailwind’s app installed on an Android smartphone. If your car doesn’t have Bluetooth, or if you’re an iPhone user, you’ll need to keep one of Tailwind’s iQ3 vehicle sensors in your car. You can purchase a kit that includes this sensor, and you can purchase extras if you have more than one car. I’ll discuss my own experience in a bit, but it wasn’t what was promised.</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-app-3-100879197-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Christopher Null / IDG</div>\n<p>Tailwind’s robust logging tells you whenever someone comes or goes.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"tailwind app 3\" width=\"300\" height=\"650\" data-imageid=\"100879197\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-app-3-100879197-medium.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-app-3-100879197-medium.jpg\"></a><small>Christopher Null / IDG</small><figcaption><p>Tailwind’s robust logging tells you whenever someone comes or goes.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Tailwind’s app setup is fairly simple, involving the scanning of a QR code on the device (or the small manual) and following a few intuitive steps to connect your opener to your Wi-Fi network (2.4GHz only). If all you want to do is open and close your door on command, the Tailwind interface couldn’t be simpler. Your doors are aligned vertically in the app (though I only tested the unit with one), and tapping on the appropriate icon causes an animation to play as the door opens or closes.</p><p>Tailwind’s settings menus, however, are decidedly lacking, in part because different functions are found in different places. If you want to change the icon for your garage or fine-tune the options around how the controller communicates with the opener, you visit one settings menu. But if you want to change Wi-Fi settings or restart the device, you’ll need to visit a different settings menu that can only be found on a different screen that’s reached by tapping the back icon from the primary interface. Options to set schedules and manage notifications (including whether the door has been left open) are in a third location, and even after a week of testing the unit I was still often confused about where to find various functions I needed.</p><p>The bigger problem—by far—is that in my testing, the Tailwind lost its connection to my Netgear Orbi CBR750 Wi-Fi 6 router with significant regularity. The router is set up in a room directly above the garage, so range should not be an issue. Be that as it may, the Tailwind would almost always show itself as unavailable whenever I initially launched the app. After a refresh, my door would eventually return to the interface and be available for interaction, but this soon became a regular annoyance, particularly if I was sitting in my car outside the garage, trying to get in.</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by TechHive's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-iq3-add-on-door-switch-100879195-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Tailwind</div>\n<p>If you need to control second and third garage doors, you’ll need one of these wired sensors on each door.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"tailwind iq3 add on door switch\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-imageid=\"100879195\" data-license=\"Supplied Art\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-iq3-add-on-door-switch-100879195-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-iq3-add-on-door-switch-100879195-large.jpg\"></a><small>Tailwind</small><figcaption><p>If you need to control second and third garage doors, you’ll need one of these wired sensors on each door.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Making matters worse is Tailwind’s “lockout” system, whereby if it fails to respond to commands twice in a row, it will stop responding altogether by locking down app-based control. To fix this, you must restart or power-cycle the Tailwind unit, or open and close the door by another means. Tailwind says this functionality is required “<a href=\"https://gotailwind.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020903011-The-door-says-LOCKED-OUT-Tailwind-doesn-t-open-or-close-the-door-How-do-I-fix-it-\" rel=\"nofollow\">by law</a>,” referencing the <a href=\"https://www.ul.com/news/convenience-and-safety-working-together-unattended-operation-residential-garage-door-operators\" rel=\"nofollow\">UL 325 safety standard</a>, which is designed to prevent children from getting maimed by unattended doors.</p><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-app-2-100879196-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Christopher Null / IDG</div>\n<p>This Tailwind “lockout” error became a daily nuisance in our experience.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"tailwind app 2\" width=\"300\" height=\"650\" data-imageid=\"100879196\" data-license=\"IDG\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-app-2-100879196-medium.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/tailwind-app-2-100879196-medium.jpg\"></a><small>Christopher Null / IDG</small><figcaption><p>This Tailwind “lockout” error became a daily nuisance in our experience.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I won’t debate Tailwind’s interpretation of UL 325 here—but I will say that I haven’t encountered this feature on any other smart garage controller I’ve tested to date, and during my testing, my iQ3 was in lockout in mode all the time. Even when I hadn’t used it at all for hours, I would sometimes find it in lockout mode, waiting to be restarted so I could use it again.</p><p>Also of note: The system beeps when the garage door closes, and this feature can’t be disabled (that’s also part of UL 325: “Before the door can close, an audible alert in the garage must sound for at least 5 seconds”).</p><p>My car is equipped with Bluetooth, but being an iPhone user, Tailwind sent me the kit with its <a href=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14157&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07FX678R3%3Ftag%3Dtechhivecom-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3DUS-003-3609899-000-1445186-web-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-productid=\"1445186\" data-product-name=\"Tailwind iQ3 Bluetooth Vehicle Sensor\" data-vars-product-name=\"Tailwind iQ3 Bluetooth Vehicle Sensor\" data-vars-link-position-id=\"000\" data-vars-link-position=\"Body Text\" data-po=\"amazon-ajax\" data-product-id=\"1445186\" data-vars-product-id=\"1445186\" data-bkc=\"SmartHome\" data-bkmfr=\"Tailwind\" data-vars-bkmfr=\"Tailwind\" data-bkvndr=\"Amazon\" data-vars-bkvndr=\"Amazon\" data-amazon-ajax-link=\"true\" data-amazon-ajax-link-loaded=\"true\" data-amazon-ajax-link-asin=\"B07FX678R3\" data-amazon-ajax-link-subtag=\"US-003-3609899-000-1445186-web-20\" data-vars-outbound-link=\"http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=14157&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07FX678R3%3Ftag%3Dtechhivecom-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26ascsubtag%3DUS-003-3609899-000-1445186-web-20\">Bluetooth sensor disc</a> included.
