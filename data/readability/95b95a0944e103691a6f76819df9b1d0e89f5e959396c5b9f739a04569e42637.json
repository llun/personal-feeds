{"title":"Bloody from earlier crash, Julian Alaphilippe wins stage 1 of the Tour de France","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/julian-alaphilippe-wins-stage-1-of-the-tour-de-france/","date":1624721140000,"content":"<div><div><p>Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-Quickstep) attacked early on the finishing climb to take a fantastic win on the crash-marred first stage of the 2021 Tour de France.</p><p>The fight for the first breakaway of the 2021 Tour de France was more punch-up than battle, lasting barely 20 km before six riders escaped the peloton. After falling short on the earlier third-category Côte de Locronan, Ide Schelling (Bora-Hansgrohe) caught his breakaway companions off-guard with an attack around 80 km from the finish. He not only took the next KOM points uncontested, but cracked on and quickly found himself a sizeable gap of up to around 2:45.</p><p>The last hour of the stage was characterised by two horrific crashes that affected most of the peloton. The first was caused by an <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/fan-causes-a-huge-crash-on-stage-1-of-the-tour-de-france/\">oblivious fan</a> more interested in getting on TV than watching the race, and the second came deep into the last 10 km, bringing the stage to a premature end for much of the peloton.</p><p>On the final climb, aptly named the Côte de la Fosse aux Loups (‘wolf pit’), Julian Alaphilippe made the first move more than 2 km from the finish line and held on to take the stage win and the first yellow jersey. Michael Matthews (BikeExchange) won the sprint for second and Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) grabbed some precious bonus seconds with third.</p><div><div><p>Tour de France (2.UWT) <span>Brest → Landerneau</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/bf/julian-alaphilippe-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"95b95a0944e103691a6f76819df9b1d0e89f5e959396c5b9f739a04569e42637","category":"Cycling"}
