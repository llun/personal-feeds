Hallie reached out with some details of her effort, including some organizations she’s currently fundraising for:</p><p><em>“I’m a teacher in Santa Barbara riding the Tour de Los Padres this year as to bring awareness to, and fundraise for the San Marcos Foothills Preserve. This public space is the ancestral home of the Chumash and one of the last remaining access points for front-country wilderness in Santa Barbara, and right across the street from the junior high I teach at. This access point is being currently threatened by corporate luxury home development.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I’m currently collecting <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hallierides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/hallierides&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615390446380000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtZ6BhvEYCGzI3EI5cSOL-uKu_sQ\">donations</a> that will go directly to two local organizations:</em></p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/seedstoforestdefense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Seeds to Forest Defense</a>, an autonomous group of Chumash, BIPOC and white allies protecting the land who center Indigenous ecological knowledge. They also work to provide resources such as lawyer fees for the indigenous folks who were arrested in ceremony while protecting our public lands.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The second organization is Save the San Marcos Foothills Preserve, led by Channel Islands Restoration, whose mission is to purchase the undeveloped property next to the San Marcos Foothills Preserve at fair market value, to protect it forever as public open space, and to restore the native habitat. You can learn more at their website, <a href=\"https://www.savesanmarcosfoothills.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.savesanmarcosfoothills.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615390446380000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGx7ax0ptu17-keDFjqvch0SfFf7g\">https://www.<wbr>savesanmarcosfoothills.org</a>&nbsp; “</em></p><p>If you can and would like to help out Hallie’s efforts, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hallierides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can donate to her cause</a>. Right now, she’s $1,000 into her $3,000 goal. Expect more to come from Hallie in the near future.</p></div><nav><h4>Related</h4></nav></article></section></div>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a61e32bec0b6f98419b250f6b740abf3ef339364253c75936b793f3dcb4c749a","category":"Cycling"}
