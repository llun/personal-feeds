By the time they figured out just how hard autocorrect algorithms were, I was already rolling out the swipe version of my keyboard, quickly approaching iPhone typing speeds. So how did they beat me?</p><p>First, they made an app that appeared to fulfill the promise of a watch keyboard â€“ but was practically unusable. Then, they started heavily advertising on FB &amp; Instagram, using my own promo video, of my own app, with my actual name on it.</p></blockquote><p>According to Eleftheriou, there are several clones of his FlickType app, but one of the most clear non-functional rip-offs was \"KeyWatch,\" which launched with a blank interface and an \"Unlock now\" button. Tapping the button prompted users to confirm an $8/week subscription for an app that doesn't do anything.</p><p>According to Eleftheriou, the scam achieved prominence in the App Store by gaming Apple's algorithmic ranking system through the purchase of fake ratings and glowing five-star reviews, which bumped it up to the top of its app category. It even advertised its software using his own promotional video, which includes his actual name.</p><div><blockquote><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Up to now, I've been in the \"Apple *wants* to do the right thing\" camp. My viewpoint is starting to change. How to spot a $5M/year scam on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppStore</a>, in 5 minutes flat:ðŸ‘‡ â€” Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1357938977748078594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Apple has since removed the fake app from the App Store, although the developer account responsible for multiple scam apps <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356725679102943232\">remains active</a>. Eleftheriou says that before KeyWatch was taken down, the developers had long benefited from what had become a $2 million-per-year scam that went largely unnoticed by Apple moderators until he personally exposed it.</p><p>Since that time, Eleftheriou has been on a Twitter crusade to expose more scam apps in the App Store, such as the so-called star gazing app that goes by the name \"Star Gazer+\" and basically uses the same time-proven strategy of masquerading as a genuine app that's barely functional and hoodwinks users into an exorbitant in-app weekly subscription fee.</p><p>As of writing, the scam app \"Star Gazer+\" is still listed on the App Store with 4.5 star average rating and over 80,000 reviews.</p><p>Eleftheriou's exposure of the rampant App Store scheme has led many more developers and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?s=20\">critics</a> to share their own experiences and hopefully put pressure on Apple to tighten up its app moderation and consider overhauling its billing interface and options, including the suggestion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1358089727962980356\">removing</a> the weekly subscription option altogether.</p><p>Apple has yet to comment on Eleftheriou's findings, but we'll be sure to update this article if we hear anything.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/macbook-pro-copy-iphone-design/\">New MacBook Pro Expected to Copy Familiar iPhone Design</a></h3><p>Apple's upcoming 2021 MacBook Pro is expected to take design cues from the iPhone 12, according to well-respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
