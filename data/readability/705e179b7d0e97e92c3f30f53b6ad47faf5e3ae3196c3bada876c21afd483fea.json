For many if not most Office users, the subscription-based service is the most convenient way to get Office, even when they want to use it as locally installed software rather than doing their work in-browser and on the cloud.</p><p>For the rest of us—and for those environments which Microsoft 365 fat clients inexplicably refuse to support, such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/welcome-to-rds\">Remote Desktop Servers</a>—there's Office 2019 now, and there will be Office 2021 later this year. There will also be a new Office LTSC (Long Term Service Channel), which trades a 10 percent price hike for a guarantee of longer support periods... longer than the consumer version of Office 2021, that is.</p><p>In reality, the \"Long Term Service Channel\" version of Office 2021 will still have a shorter support life cycle than that enjoyed by previous versions of Office. Office 2019 had a seven-year support window—Office 2021 LTSC will only offer five. There's no official word yet on the support life cycle of the presumably shorter-lived consumer version of Office 2021.</p><p>So far, Office 2021 looks like it will mostly focus on visual updates—its apps include a new Dark Mode for those who prefer light text on a dark background, and unspecified accessibility improvements are on the way as well. Excel is scheduled to get a few meatier improvements ported in from Office 365, including <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dynamic-array-formulas-in-non-dynamic-aware-excel-696e164e-306b-4282-ae9d-aa88f5502fa2\">dynamic arrays</a> and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xlookup-function-b7fd680e-6d10-43e6-84f9-88eae8bf5929\">xlookup</a>. The few Office 2021 screenshots we've seen don't otherwise appear dramatically different from earlier versions.</p><p>Both Office 2021 and Office 2021 LTSC will include OneNote and will be available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Office 2021 is expected to be available on both Windows and Mac in the second half of 2021, with a Windows preview of the LTSC version expected in April.</p></div></div>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"705e179b7d0e97e92c3f30f53b6ad47faf5e3ae3196c3bada876c21afd483fea","category":"Tech"}
