In this article, we’ll discuss the complexity and challenges of mobile, and how mobile testing tools can help us with just that.</section></p><p>Things have changed quite a bit over the last decade when we just started exploring what we could do on a tiny, shiny mobile screen. These days, with mobile traffic accounting for <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\">over 50% of web traffic</a>, it’s fair to assume that the very first encounter of your prospect customers with your brand will happen on a mobile device.</p><p>Depending on the nature of your product, the share of your mobile traffic will vary significantly, but you will certainly have <em>some</em> mobile traffic —&nbsp;and being prepared for it can make or break the deal. This requires your website or application to be <strong>heavily optimized for mobile</strong>. This optimization is quite complex in nature though.&nbsp;Obviously, our experiences will be responsive — and we’ve learned how to do so well over the years —&nbsp;but it also has to be accessible and fast.</p><p>This goes way beyond basic optimizations such as color contrast and server response times. In the fragmented mobile landscape, our experiences have to be adjusted for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colinbendell/status/1265675813204172810\">low data mode</a>, <a href=\"https://umaar.com/dev-tips/242-considerate-javascript/\">low memory, battery and CPU</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/\">reduced motion</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/\">dark and light mode</a> and so many other conditions.</p><p>Leaving these conditions out of the equation means <strong>abandoning prospect customers</strong> for good, and so we seek compromises to deliver a great experience within tight deadlines. And to ensure the quality of a product, we always need to test —&nbsp;on a number of devices, and in a number of conditions.</p><h3 id=\"state-of-mobile-2021\">State Of Mobile 2021</h3><p>While many of us, designers and developers, are likely to have a relatively new mobile phone in our pockets, a vast majority of our customers isn’t quite like us. That might come a little bit unexpected. After all, when we look at our analytics, we will hardly find any customers browsing our sites or apps with a <strong>mid-range device on a flaky 3G connection</strong>.</p><p>The gotcha here is that, if your mobile experience isn’t optimized for various devices and network conditions, these customers will never appear in your analytics —&nbsp;just because your website or app will be barely usable on their devices, and so they are unlikely to return.</p><p>In the US and the UK, <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2020/Global-State-of-Mobile\">Comscore’s Global State of Mobile 2020 report</a> discovered in August 2020, that mobile usage accounted to 79% and 81% of total digital minutes respectively. Also, there was a 65% increase in video consumption on mobile devices in 2020. While a vast majority of the time is spent in just a few mobile apps, social media platforms provide a gateway to the web and your services — especially in education.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3077327c-a09e-4245-89f7-a263f1c5f45b/comscore-insights.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"Globally, time spent on mobile continues to rise around the world.\"></a><figcaption>Globally, time spent on mobile continues to rise around the world, according to <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2020/Global-State-of-Mobile\">ComScore Global State of Mobile 2020 report</a>.

The impact of the signal is expected to be small, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/methode/status/1255224116648476675\">similar to HTTPS ranking boost</a>.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" importance=\"low\" width=\"800\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png 2000w\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" alt=\"Lighthouse CI is quite remarkable: a suite of tools to continuously run, save, retrieve, and assert against Lighthouse results\"></a><figcaption>A performance benchmark Lighthouse is well-known.

(<a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9c380575-7a95-48cc-bd49-08bbd2c006bd/lighthouse-ci-opt.png\">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>One thing is certain though: your websites will rank better if they are better optimized for mobile, both in terms of speed and mobile-friendliness — it goes for accessibility as well.</p><h4 id=\"improving-accessibility\">Improving Accessibility</h4><p>Building accessible pages and applications isn’t easy. The challenges start with tiny hit targets, poor contrast and small font size, but it quickly gets much more complicated when we deal with complex single-page-applications. To ensure that we cater well for our customers in various situations — with &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/\">permanent, temporary and situational disabilities</a> —&nbsp;we need to test for accessibility.</p><p>That means considering <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-289/\">keyboard navigation</a>, how navigation landmarks are properly assigned, how updates are announced by a screen reader, and whether we avoid any inaccessible libraries or third-party scripts. And then, for every component we are building, we need to ensure that we keep them accessible over time.</p><p>It shouldn’t be surprising that if a website isn’t accessible to a customer, they are unlikely to access your product either. The earlier you invest in accessibility testing, the more you’ll save down the road on expensive consultancy, expensive third-party services, or expensive lawyers.</p><h3 id=\"mobile-web-testing\">Mobile Web Testing</h3><p>So, with all the challenges in the mobile space, how, then, do we test on mobile? Fortunately, there is no shortage of <strong>mobile testing tools</strong> out there. However, most times, when performing mobile testing, the focus is mostly on consistency and functionality but for a more thorough mobile test, we need to go a layer deeper into some not-so-obvious specifics of testing.</p><h4 id=\"screen-sizes\">Screen sizes</h4><p>Screen sizes are one of the many things that are always changing in the realm of mobile devices. Year after year new screen sizes and pixel densities appear with new device releases. This poses a problem in testing websites and apps on these devices, making debugging more difficult and time-consuming.</p><h4 id=\"os-version-fragmentation\">OS Version fragmentation</h4><p>With iOS having a high adoption rate on its latest OS releases (a rate of 57% on its latest iOS 14), and the plethora of versions still being used by <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/271774/share-of-android-platforms-on-mobile-devices-with-android-os/\">Android devices</a> going as far back as Ice Cream Sandwich, one must make sure to account to this fragmentation when doing mobile testing.</p><h4 id=\"browser-fragmentation\">Browser fragmentation</h4><p>With Chrome and Safari having a global usage of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/263517/market-share-held-by-mobile-internet-browsers-worldwide/\">62.63% and 24.55% on mobile</a> respectively, one might be tempted to focus on just these browsers when performing mobile tests. However, depending on the region of the world, you are more likely to test in other, less-known browsers, or <a href=\"https://timkadlec.com/2015/07/understanding-proxy-browsers-architecture/\">proxy browsers</a>, such as Opera Mini. Even though their percentage usage might be small, it might run into hundreds of thousands of usage globally.</p><h3 id=\"performing-mobile-web-testing\">Performing Mobile Web Testing</h3><p>To perform mobile web testing, one option is to <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/establishing-an-open-device-lab/\">set up a device lab</a>, and run tests locally. In times of remote work, it’s quite challenging as you usually need a number of devices at your disposal. Acquiring these devices doesn’t have to be expensive, and experiencing the loading on your own is extremely valuable. However, if we want to check how consistent the experience is, or conduct automated tests, it’s probably not going to be enough.</p><p>In such cases, a good starting point is <a href=\"https://responsively.app/\">Responsively</a>, a free open-source tool with mirrored interactions, customizable layout, 30+ built-in device profiles, hot reloading and screenshot tools.</p><p>Also, you might want to look into dedicated developer-focused browsers for mobile testing as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://sizzy.co/\">Sizzy</a> supports sync scrolling, clicking and navigation across devices, as well as takes screenshots of all devices at once, with and without a device frame. Plus, it includes a Universal Inspect Element to inspect all devices at once.</p><p><a href=\"https://blisk.io/\">Blisk</a> supports over 50 devices out of the box, along with sync scrolling. You can test touch support and preview devices side-by-side, working with the same piece of code across all opened devices. Hot-reloading is supported as well, as well as video recording and screenshots.</p><p>Another little helpful tool is <a href=\"https://www.lambdatest.com/lt-browser\">LT Browser</a>, a web application allowing you to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH95O9mOGoc\">perform mobile view debugging on 45+ devices</a> — on mobile, tablet and desktop.
