Twelve South assures that SurfaceSnap's adhesive can stick to almost any smooth surface and leaves no residue when removed, allowing it to be repositioned elsewhere.</p><p>SurfaceSnap is primarily designed to offer a slim, aesthetically-pleasing alternative to bulky cable managers that use weight to hold cables in place.
