They’re comfortable, ultralight, and with the included charging case, we could basically get a full day of use from them.</p><p>For cycling, they work independently, letting us run just one ear to maintain situational awareness while still enjoying high quality sound and an excellent lack of wind noise. Our only complaint was that they’re sonically opaque…meaning, they block out nearly all outside noise.</p><p><a

Here’s the bullet point list of new features:</p><ul><li>Ambient sound amplifier</li><li>Active noise cancellation</li><li>In-ear sensor</li><li>Even more waterproof and durable</li><li>24 hour battery life</li><li>Improved “Find My Earbuds/Case” features</li><li>Improved Sport Eargels for custom fit</li></ul><p>Let’s start with the sound. The new Vista 2.0 gets 6mm drivers for big sound, but also adds four external microphones – two per side. These&nbsp;exterior microphones serve two purposes. The easy one is better, clearer phone calls thanks to beamforming that focuses pickup on your voice while ignoring other noises.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10.jpg\" alt=\"jaybird vista 2 wireless earbuds closeup details in its charging case\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07175148/jaybird-vista-2-wireless-earbuds-for-cyclists-and-athletes-10-420x420.jpg 420w\"></a></p><p>They’ve also added a new WindDefense fabric cover for the exterior, which reduces wind noise when using them to talk while moving fast.

Or throw them at. They’re IP68 rated, so you can submerge them for 30 minutes and they’ll be fine.</p><p>The case is&nbsp;IP54 rated, so more splashproof and sweatproof…but it’s now wireless charging compatible and has more LEDs on the outside to give you a better sense of the charge level.</p><h3>They’re so small… won’t I lose them?</h3><p>Probably, but only for a few minutes. The original had a “find my bud” feature. Now, that feature works even better, and there’s a “find my case”, too.</p><p>In the app, you can choose which bud (left or right) you want to find, and it’ll show on a map the last place it was used while connected to your phone…and it’s connected pretty much anytime you’re listening to something. You can do the same for the case, too.</p><p>You can also ping the buds if they’re within Bluetooth range and make them start beeping so you can listen for them…great for when you swear you set them down on the desk but now they’ve disappeared.</p><h3>Jaybird Vista 2 specs &amp; pricing</h3><p>Here’s the rest of the tech specs on these new sport earbuds:</p><ul><li>24 hour total battery life (with 3x full charges from the case)</li><li>8 hour ear bud life standard</li><li>6 hour ear bud life with Active Noise Cancelling turned on</li><li>5 minute quick charge = 1 hour listening time</li><li>2×2 Mic beamforming</li><li>6mm milled driver</li><li>4 mics</li><li>In-ear detection</li><li>IPX8 + MIL 810G (earbuds)</li><li>IPX4 (case)</li><li>Colors: Black, Nimbus Gray, Midnight Blue</li></ul><p>Available now for <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=9722ea01-9ca6-40e1-89ee-1c2b552b45e5&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaybirdsport.com%2Fen-us%2Fvista2.html&amp;ctc=BRGCNewsBiking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$199.99</a>, you can get them direct and on <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=66cdaaa7-8814-4e40-89d5-6897c9314cab&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuckberry.com%2Fstore%2Fjaybird%2Fcategory%2Fp%2F67468-vista-2-earthproof-wireless-headphones&amp;ctc=BRGCNewsBiking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huckberry</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=el&amp;merchant_id=9722ea01-9ca6-40e1-89ee-1c2b552b45e5&amp;website_id=3407ca35-0b50-44fe-aeb1-9ab6a93bba54&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jaybirdsport.com%2Fen-us&amp;ctc=BRGCNewsBiking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>JaybirdSport.com</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"874f84e46425efcd671f0aa14dbd1cd32dc6fcfbf012937359b92f1bc4f9407b","category":"Cycling"}
