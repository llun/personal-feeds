Lockdown got you feeling like you want to know what happens if you put your finger in a plug socket? If, like me, your default position is boundless curiosity mixed with a flagrant disrespect for authority, you too could be seeing red dots every time you blink for five minutes.</p><p>This, despite a warning being written in capital letters on the instructions, is what happened to me when I looked directly into the Lezyne Zecto Drive 250 rear light when I turned it on. And, in case you were wondering, that’s a positive point, not a criticism.</p>&nbsp;<h3>It’s a setup</h3><p>Temporary blindness forgotten, the setup of the Lezyne Zecto Drive 250 rear light is satisfyingly simple. Attaching the provided mini-USB cable to the easily accessed charging port sees the LED light fully charged in four hours.</p><p>Of course, this does mean you need to plug it in some time before you need it, if you’ve allowed the battery to discharge totally. How you mount it is down to what you intend to use it for. I’ve clipped it on to a backpack for extra visibility when just nipping into town, but more commonly have attached it to the rear of a seatpost for longer rides in the countryside, where it’s a welcome source of (as Lezyne terms it) ‘highly disruptive’ light.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.probikekit.co.uk/cycling-accessories/lezyne-zecto-max-drive-250-rear-light/11509392.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Lezyne Zecto Max Drive 250 rear light from ProBikeKit now</strong></em></a></p><p>The only fiddle is getting the rubber strap over the tight clip in order to mount the light (I could almost feel the callouses forming on my fingertips).</p>&nbsp;<p>Its rounded profile means it fits traditional cylindrical seatposts best, although a shallow box-profile aero seatmast on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/focus/9028/focus-izalco-max-disc-86-2021-review\">Focus Izalco Max</a> carried it sufficiently. Sadly, that strap won’t stretch far enough to wrap around true aero seatposts, such as that of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/9046/cannondale-systemsix-ultegra-review\">Cannondale SystemSix</a>.</p><h3>Blinded by the light</h3><p>...and the choice of modes, for that matter. The Lezyne Zecto Drive 250 rear light offers a comprehensive range of modes – eight in total – for pretty much any riding situation.</p><p>The brightest output of 250 lumens is achieved in ‘day flash 1’ mode, but you’ll also eat the battery in nine hours of use. ‘Economy’ mode might put out only five lumens, but it’s still better than no light, enough to attract attention in low light conditions, and is claimed to eke out that battery life to a whopping 24 hours.</p>&nbsp;<p>Mostly, I’ve opted for ‘day flash 2’, which gives you 125 lumens of pulsing illumination, and in real-life riding conditions (ie, getting out at least every other day), narrows the battery charging necessity to just twice a month.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.probikekit.co.uk/cycling-accessories/lezyne-zecto-max-drive-250-rear-light/11509392.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Lezyne Zecto Max Drive 250 rear light from ProBikeKit now</strong></em></a></p><h3>Practical touches</h3><p>If you’re of a certain age, you’ll recall the boxy, white plastic lights we bracket-mounted on our Raleigh Pacers’ seatstays. Besides looking awful, they were also hard to operate without coming to a halt.</p><p>The Lezyne Zecto Drive 250 rear light is a delight in this respect, with a quick reach around to the seatpost being all that’s required to toggle through modes, thanks to a tactile rubberised button on the top of the unit.</p><p>It’s also particularly compact, meaning the weight penalty to fitting it is negligible, and it’s easily stashed – even in a jersey pocket. Add to this the fact that the USB port is well protected by a waterproof cover, and you’ve fuss-free lighting at the push of a button.</p><p>I can’t help wondering where the logic is in locating that port in the one place it’s guaranteed to be peppered with road spray and dirt, but it’s nonetheless survived.</p><h3>Bright idea</h3><p>In all, £50 for a light that’s not a supplementary LED but pretty much the only rear light you need in your arsenal, is a very keen price.</p><p>In deep winter use it has proved particularly durable, it barely needs charging, and it provides essential peace of mind.</p><p>The lower-output modes mean I rarely detach it from the bike; even on economy mode, you can be seen by following traffic from a greater distance, and I think I can stomach the extra 74g it adds to my bike…</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"3cc320d05f000c40be0af70eafcbfef1319d305577deac1fdbabd54bd133ab1e","category":"Cycling"}
