Welcome to Women’s Cycling Weekly issue 20 🚴‍♀️</p><p>My mathematically-challenged brain struggles with the concept of measuring things in weeks, usually children: “they’re 40 weeks old” — that simply does not make sense to me. But this particular ‘baby’ has been in the world for 20 weeks (or is perhaps still — in some ways— gestating). It feels like a nice, round number and some kind of milestone. I’ll pretend that is the reason I am giving away a copy of a book and that it was all entirely planned that way.</p><h2>Competition Winner</h2><p>Without further ado, then, the winner of a copy of the Most Excellent&nbsp;<em><strong>Revolutions</strong></em>&nbsp;by Hannah Ross is…<strong>Rhian Denton</strong>! 🥳 Congrats! Hit ‘reply’ on this email and we’ll sort out your free copy of the book.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>As the preamble to this newsletter is getting quite long, consider this a taster because in the coming weeks and months there may be some bonus long-form issues incoming.

They do not, however, have the ability to enforce this until the UCI Disciplinary Commission decide on a sanction.</li><li>In the next episode of The UCI Doing Things Backwards,&nbsp;<strong>Aromitalia-Basso Bikes-Vaiano</strong>&nbsp;rider<strong>&nbsp;Letizia Borghesi&nbsp;</strong>was disqualified and fined 500CHF at&nbsp;<strong>Tour of Flanders</strong>&nbsp;(more than Annemiek van Vleuten took for winning) for throwing a bottle (it was later reduced to 200CHF). Borghesi said that she ‘felt like a criminal.’</li><li><strong>Loughborough University</strong>&nbsp;in the UK&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/news/2021/april/new-lightning-cycling-franchise-launched/\">have launched an elite women’s cycling team</a>&nbsp;who will compete at national level, called ‘<strong>Lightning Cycling</strong>’ great name.&nbsp;</li><li>Walmart heir, T<strong>om Walton</strong>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/walmart-heir-and-cycling-proponent-tom-walton-denounces-arkansas-anti-trans-legislation/\">has added his voice&nbsp;</a>to the dissent over the anti-trans bill in Arkansas. The state is due to host the 2022 Cyclocross World Championships and many have called for a boycott of the event over the discriminatory law which prevents trans women and girls from competing in school sports team consistent with their identity. Elsewhere, the head of USA cycling<a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/usa-cycling-ceo-against-arkansas-boycott-says-it-would-be-ceremonial/\">&nbsp;has said</a>&nbsp;that a boycott would be ‘ceremonial’.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Kasia Niewiadoma</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wmncycling.com/kasia-extends-her-contract-through-to-end-of-2024/\">has extended her contract with&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.wmncycling.com/kasia-extends-her-contract-through-to-end-of-2024/\">Canyon//SRAM</a>&nbsp;</strong>to the end of 2024.

After a group split over the Koppenburg full of all of the favourites (apart from&nbsp;<strong>Marianne Vos&nbsp;</strong>of<strong>&nbsp;Jumbo-Visma</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Kasia Niewiadoma</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Canyon//SRAM</strong>) Van Vleuten attacked over the Paterburg and stayed away to the line.&nbsp;<strong>Lisa Brennauer&nbsp;</strong>of<strong>Ceratizit-WNT</strong>&nbsp;took the sprint for second, with&nbsp;<strong>Grace Brown&nbsp;</strong>of<strong>&nbsp;BikeExchange</strong>in third.

Barring a few crashes and splits the race stayed mostly together until 18-year-old&nbsp;<strong>Daniek Hengeveld&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>GT Krush Tunap</strong>&nbsp;— who made a similar move on the first stage of the&nbsp;<strong>Healthy Ageing Tour</strong>— chipped off the front with 44km to go. Hengeveld was caught and in another piece of symmetry with HAT,&nbsp;<strong>Lorena Wiebes&nbsp;</strong>of<strong>&nbsp;Team DSM</strong>&nbsp;(who crashed at the finish of the same stage while looking strong for the sprint) took the win.&nbsp;<strong>Emma Norsgaard</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Movistar</strong>&nbsp;took second and&nbsp;<strong>Elisa Balsamo</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Valcar Travel and Service</strong>&nbsp;second.
