Though it may still be possible for fully vaccinated people to contract the pandemic coronavirus, have an asymptomatic or mild infection, and possibly spread the virus, the risk is considered low.</p><p>As such, once people are fully vaccinated, they can meet in private indoor settings—such as a home—with other fully vaccinated people without masks and without physical distancing.</p><p>Fully vaccinated people can also meet in private indoor settings with <em>unvaccinated</em> people without masks and without physical distancing—if those unvaccinated people are from a single household and they do NOT have an increased risk of severe COVID-19. That means unvaccinated people who are under age 65 and do not have any underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes.</p><div><ul><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.10.43-AM-150x150.jpeg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.10.43-AM.jpeg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.10.43-AM-980x471.jpeg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.10.43-AM-1440x692.jpeg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1747880\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1747880\"><span></span><p>Scenario where unvaccinated are low risk</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.09.54-AM-150x150.jpeg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.09.54-AM.jpeg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.09.54-AM-980x470.jpeg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.09.54-AM-1440x691.jpeg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1747879\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1747879\"><span></span><p>Scenario where everyone is vaccinated</p><p><span></span> CDC</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.01-AM-150x150.jpg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.01-AM.jpg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.01-AM-980x470.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.01-AM-1440x690.jpg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1747895\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1747895\"><span></span><p>Scenario where one unvaccinated persons is high risk</p><p><span></span> CDC</p></figcaption></figure></li><li data-thumb=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.32-AM-150x150.jpeg\" data-src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.32-AM.jpeg\" data-responsive=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.32-AM-980x472.jpeg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-11.12.32-AM-1440x693.jpeg 2560\" data-sub-html=\"#caption-1747881\"><figure><figcaption id=\"caption-1747881\"><span></span><p>Scenario where there's multiple households</p><p><span></span> CDC</p></figcaption></figure></li></ul></div><p>“Here’s an example,” CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky said in a White House press briefing Monday. \"If grandparents have been vaccinated, they can visit their daughter and her family even if they have not been vaccinated, so long as the daughter and her family are not at risk for severe disease.”</p><p>If an unvaccinated person with high risk of severe disease enters the mix at any point (if they are present for the visit or absent during the visit, but living in an involved household) then everyone—including the fully vaccinated people—needs to keep wearing masks, stay physically distanced, and meet in a well-ventilated outdoor space.</p><p>Similarly, when fully vaccinated people are meeting with unvaccinated people from multiple households—regardless of risk status—everyone should be masked, distanced, and meet outdoors in a well-ventilated space to prevent spread among the unvaccinated.</p><p>Lastly, fully vaccinated people do not need to quarantine or be tested for COVID-19 if they have a known exposure to an infected person but do not have any symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>While the new guidance loosens the restrictions in these specific private settings, the CDC held onto restrictions on travel and in public settings. That means fully vaccinated people should still avoid gatherings, non-essential travel, and still wear masks and stay physically distanced in public places.</p><p>“COVID-19 continues to exact a tremendous toll on our nation,” Walensky said. “Like you, I want to be able to return to everyday activities and engage with our friends, families, and communities.”</p><p>Though many families will rejoice in today’s guidance, “it is not our final destination,” she added. “As more people get vaccinated, levels of COVID-19 infection decline in communities, and as our understanding of COVID immunity improves, we look forward to updating these recommendations to the public.”</p></div></div>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30f8714fabce1fea467e965c1fb16891dfbc66ae6fb29cc30f597655a2c525d7","category":"Tech"}
