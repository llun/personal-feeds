But I also need relaxation and good food. Then I dare to order a pizza from Pizza Hut.'</p><p>If we had to hazard a guess, we'd have Remco down as a stuffed crust pepperoni kind of guy. Although with the 21-year-old set to make his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a> debut in May, our fingers are crossed he will have the opportunity to sample some better pizza then.</p><div id=\"file-43905\"><p><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/03/quick-step-latexco.jpg?itok=tBXskx5y\" alt=\"\"></p></div><p>Awkwardly posing with products from sponsors also feels like a right of stardom passage for QuickStep riders too. I mean who can forget the yearly Latexco pillow fights? Or Tom Boonen in a bathtub of baked beans? It's standard practice for Patrick Lefevere's men.</p><p>Oh, and just to make you feel old, by the time Remco's five-year Pizza Hut deal expires, he will have only just turned 26 years old.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"343185027a75a91bbd9b35005a7a9850976ad9c85099ea95bcebc4f10fe0cf68","category":"Cycling"}
