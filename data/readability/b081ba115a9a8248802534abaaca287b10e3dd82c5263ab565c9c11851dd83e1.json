With firmware update 4.75, Favero has enabled automatic zero-offset as default on the brand’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/12/ten-products-i-loved-in-2020-ronan-mc-laughlin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">popular power pedals</a>.</p><p>The pedals still require a manual zero offset after changing bikes. Where previously Assioma recommended a manual zero-offset before every use for “maximum precision”, the new automatic feature should remove this requirement.</p><p>Fluctuations of temperature and altitude can also mean a power meter may require a zero-offset mid-ride to ensure continued accuracy. This firmware update will automate this mid-ride zero-offset.</p><p>Favero has not announced details on how the offset operates, but other power meters with an automatic function typically zero-offset after two seconds of freewheeling.</p><p>For more information on how to perform the update visit <a href=\"https://cycling.favero.com/blog/tech-tests/how-to-update-the-assioma-firmware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Favero.com</a></p><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b081ba115a9a8248802534abaaca287b10e3dd82c5263ab565c9c11851dd83e1","category":"Cycling"}
