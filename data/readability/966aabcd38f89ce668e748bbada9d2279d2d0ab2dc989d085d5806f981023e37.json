On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/hyundai-kia-say-they-aren-t-in-ev-discussions-with-apple\">Bloomberg reported that</a> \"people familiar with the matter\" told the publication that \"Apple paused discussions with Hyundai and Kia weeks ago\".</p><p>Apple's highly secretive vehicle plans—codenamed Project Titan—have driven a lot of speculation over the years. The latest bout of rumormongering began in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/apple-is-allegedly-working-on-a-passenger-car-breakthrough-battery-tech/\">December 2020</a>, when Reuters, citing anonymous sources, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSKBN28V2PY\">claimed that Apple was going to start building and selling a car by 2024</a>.</p><p>The rumors shifted to a higher gear in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/apple-allegedly-working-with-hyundai-on-electric-car-for-2027/\">early January</a>, when the Korea Economic Daily reported that <a href=\"https://www.hankyung.com/news/article/2021010802115\">Apple had been in talks with the Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Group</a>. This was confirmed by Hyundai to other outlets, albeit vaguely; <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html\">the company told CNBC</a> that Apple had been in talks with other automakers as well and that no deals had been signed.</p><p>Last week, speculation had reached the point where <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html\">we were told that \"fully autonomous\" Apple Cars</a> would go into production at Kia's factory in West Point, Georgia, within the next few years. However, the report also suggested—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/apples-car-project-could-put-it-on-a-collision-course-with-tesla/\">improbably, in our view</a>—that these Apple Cars could be destined for life as robotaxis or even delivering packages.</p><p>Hyundai and Kia stocks both fell following the denial. As for a possible Apple Car, I'll remain skeptical until Apple shows it off on stage.</p></div></div>","author":"Jonathan M.
