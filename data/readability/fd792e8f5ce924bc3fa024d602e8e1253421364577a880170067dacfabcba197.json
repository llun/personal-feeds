And we work hard daily to provide reliable and resilient solutions for our customers that evolve with the industry's requirements, while providing a trusted, quality experience for our members. One of the bigger industry shifts is Apple's upcoming changes to Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), which companies use for tracking and ad targeting.</p><p>We want to share an update on our plans and guidance to help you prepare for these changes. We have decided to stop our iOS apps' collection of IDFA data for now. Although this change affects the LinkedIn Audience Network (LAN), Conversion Tracking and Matched Audiences, we expect limited impact to your campaign performance, and don't foresee major changes required for your campaign set-up.</p></blockquote><p>LinkedIn plans to \"regularly reevaluate\" the usage of the advertising identifier, but the company says it is committed to \"privacy-by-design principles\" that \"provide a trusted experience\" for LinkedIn users. Rather than using the IDFA, LinkedIn says that it will leverage its first-party data to help marketers reach buyer groups.</p><p>LinkedIn's message that abandoning the IDFA will have a limited impact to campaign performance for LinkedIn advertisers is a different message than other major social networking sites like Facebook have been sharing. Facebook has claimed that Apple's App Tracking Transparency changes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/\">will have a major impact</a> on the small businesses that use Facebook advertising tools.</p><p>Twitter this week also said that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/twitter-cfo-apple-app-tracking-changes/\">is not concerned</a> about Apple's ad tracking changes because Twitter does not heavily rely on the IDFA. Twitter CFO Ned Segal said that Apple's IDFA restrictions will actually \"level the playing field\" by giving all advertisers new challenges to face. Twitter has, however, said that App Tracking Transparency will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/twitter-apple-app-tracking-transparency-impact/\">have a \"modest\" impact</a> on revenue.</p><p>Facebook and other advertisers that have spoken out against App Tracking Transparency are concerned about Apple's changes because many do not believe that users will consent to being tracked across apps for ad personalization purposes.</p><p>All of the App Tracking Transparency code is in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> at the current time, but starting with the release of iOS 14.5, all apps that access the IDFA will need to implement the ad tracking popup that allows users to give or deny permission to use the IDFA.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-lawsuit-programmed-obsolescence-portugal/\">Apple Faces Another iPhone Lawsuit Over 'Programmed Obsolescence'</a></h3><p>Monday March 1, 2021 6:44 am PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/sami-fathi/\" rel=\"author\">Sami Fathi</a></p><p>Apple faces a new class-action lawsuit that accuses it of deliberately releasing iOS updates that slowly reduce the performance of an iPhone, forcing customers to upgrade their devices.
