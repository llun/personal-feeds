It involves the rider shifting down and sitting on the bike's top tube while tucking in the elbows and shoulders to make themselves more aerodynamically efficient.&nbsp;</p><p>Froome famously used the technique in winning Stage 8 of the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> but to understand it better, watch the below video of Mohoric at the 2018 GP Industria Artigianato.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet while Froome, Mohoric and others were using this fast descending position to gain an edge over their pro compatriots, the UCI was considering whether to ban it, pondering the potential danger it could add to the peloton.</p><p>Now, after being discussed at the UCI Management Committee last year, the UCI has decided to outlaw the position, classing it as 'dangerous conduct'.</p><p>'The UCI Management Committee also decided to reinforce the regulation concerning potentially dangerous conduct of riders, including throwing a bottle onto the road or within the peloton (which may pose a danger for following riders), and taking up dangerous positions on the bike (especially sitting on the top tube,' the UCI's statement announcing the rule change said.</p><p>The new regulations banning the move will coming into force on 1st April.</p><p>In the same statement, the UCI announced it would finally be creating a standard for roadside guard barriers. The process will be 'led by experts' and focus 'in particular for bunch sprints' with the new standards coming into play in the 2022 season.</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a> sprinter Fabio Jakobsen suffered a life-threatening crash at the Tour of Poland after colliding with barriers that disconnected on impact.</p><p>The UCI banned <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9154/dylan-groenewegen-required-police-protection-after-death-threats\">fellow Dutch sprinter Dylan Groenewegen</a> of Jumbo-Visma for nine months for his part in the incident but is still yet to officially apologise or comment on the race course into Katowice that has been widely criticised for its danger.</p></div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"a4d1f41851198f04d6f7b66c9bc23180b153b5f72fcf9985e7edfa1a9433ba30","category":"Cycling"}
