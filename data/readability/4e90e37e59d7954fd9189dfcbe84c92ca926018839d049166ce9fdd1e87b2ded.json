{"title":"[Sponsor] Atoms Are Sold Out","link":"https://atoms.com/df-march","date":1614645637000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><p><span><p>Hey Daring Fireball readers, many of you are familiar with Atoms, and a lot of you wear our shoes and the comfortable masks we make (thank you!).</p><p>We are currently sold out of almost all of our shoes because Humans of New York did an in depth story on our co-founder Sidraâ€™s personal journey. So this week, instead of ordering with Atoms, we would encourage you to <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/aoc-social-20210219?refcode=atomsdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support relief efforts in Texas</a>.</p><p>And while you are at it, do read the story at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidraqasim/status/1354922768219992065\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Humans of New York</a>, it is a bit long, but right in the sweet spot you all like. Thanks</p></span></p></div>","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4e90e37e59d7954fd9189dfcbe84c92ca926018839d049166ce9fdd1e87b2ded","category":"Tech"}
