Code within the beta software reads, \"To improve charging efficiency and maximize available battery life, the battery pack will keep your phone charged at around 90%.\"</p><p>Apple has been researching the ability for devices to charge each other for some time. Patents <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-researching-wireless-charging-ecosystem/\">discovered</a> in January reveal a concept of a future MacBook wirelessly charging an ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch on either side of the trackpad. The patent envisions an ecosystem in which devices are reliant on each other for charging, and presumably syncing.</p><p>Despite the feature not being officially released, the technology itself is already available within the ‌iPhone 12‌. According to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/14/hidden-iphone-12-feature-could-still-be-unlocked/\">FCC filings</a>, all models in the ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup have the ability to reverse charge an Apple accessory on the back. The ‌iPhone‌ would serve as a wireless charging pad for devices with wireless charging compatibility such as the ‌AirPods‌ (second generation), <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and the Apple Watch Series 3 and later.</p><p>In theory, Apple could enable the feature with an iOS update, although there's no indication the company will. It could be holding off on enabling the feature until it releases the newly reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-working-on-magsafe-battery-iphone-12/\">MagSafe battery accessories</a>.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
