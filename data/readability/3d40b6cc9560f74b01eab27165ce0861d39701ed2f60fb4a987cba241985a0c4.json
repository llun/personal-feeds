To fuel your first stride, don’t miss our series of interviews that shines a spotlight on some of the most promising of the next generation of French athletes. We spent a day with them to get an idea of the effort and the sacrifices they make daily; to understand their motivations; their state of mind after an unprecedented year; and the dreams they want to make reality. These athletes took us to their favourite training grounds and showed us a segment that suits their strengths, their specialism, or their character – so you can measure yourself against the future of French athletics.</p><p>Come with us for <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/11688123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quentin Malriq</a>’s ‘life segment’, as told by the Distance team, with photos by Anne Sophie Soudoplatoff.</p><p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;QUENTIN MALRIQ\\n20 years old\\nFavourite segment: xx\\nRunner up in the U23 1,500 metres at the French national championships\\nGrenoble, France\\n&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:6530,&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,15987699],&quot;10&quot;:0,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,16711680],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;arial&quot;}\"><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/11688123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">QUENTIN MALRIQ</a><br>20 years old<br>Favourite segment: <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8652709?filter=overall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1000m Stade Bachelard</a><br>Runner up in the U23 1,500 metres at the French national championships<br>Grenoble, France<br></span></p><p><strong>Hi Quentin. How are you and where are you at in this strange season?</strong><br>Hi! I’m all right. Training was difficult for me during lockdown, I got going again gently during the second month, then I went off on a training camp and now I’m doing OK. There have been a couple of hitches that meant I had to stop, but I’m trying not to get too hung up about it and keep going to the end of the season.</p><p><strong>How did you begin in athletics?</strong><br>That’s a bit of a long story. Six years ago my parents separated; I was living in the mountains at Saint Laurent du Pont and my mother moved here, to Grenoble, where I didn’t have many social connections – I didn’t really know anyone. I wasn’t bad at cross country in high school and my mother signed me up to a sports club so that I met some people my age. It quickly went well, and I’ve been taking part in athletics for five and a half years now. I saw I was good at the 1,500 and it all followed on quite logically from there.</p><p><strong>What are your best qualities and your weaknesses? How did you choose your event?</strong><br>My biggest weakness is my head. I have difficulty making myself suffer, particularly in competition. During training it usually goes well, I’m good in pretty much all areas; some days my head does me a disservice, but other days it can really be a positive. Last year I was injured all season and when I got to the national championships I wasn’t at all the favourite: that day my head really helped me out – I placed second and beat quite a few guys. It’s a weakness and a strength at the same time. I’ve done a little at every distance, but the 1,500 was the first where I really performed, and when that happens you don’t let go.</p><p><strong>When did you realise that you had the potential, that you really stood out?</strong><br>The first time was when I was 17. My record for the 3,000 was 9’20”, but the next year I raced against <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/19861844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthony Pontier</a>, <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/17849304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fabien Palcau</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/2644774\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Louis Moreau</a> – guys I wasn’t in the same league as. They went off the front and I said to myself, ‘I’ll go with them!’ That day I ran an 8’29” and put a minute into my PB, and people said, ‘That was something!’ The next year I was pretty good and the year after that I was French champion in the 1,500 and second in the 3,000. When I started getting those medals, people said, ‘He’s got something!’</p><p><strong>Who are the most important people around you these days?</strong><br>Firstly – and logically – there’s my family: my mother and father, my girlfriend who does triathlons. And then there’s my coach, my friends, my physio; I spend enormous amounts of time talking with my physio, we’re a great little team.</p><p><strong>What has your sport taught you and how has that helped you grow?</strong><br>I’ve grown a lot thanks to my sport. I didn’t have the same mentality before it. I wasn’t very self-confident, and when I started athletics the good results quickly helped me gain confidence and mature.</p><p><strong>In what ways is your environment ideal for your training?</strong><br>My environment is good because we’re a group of friends, when I go to training, it’s to go see my friends and I’m happy. Here (in Grenoble) you have everything you need to train right. When I want to go cycling, the mountains are close; there’s a track in a big park where I can run with no bother, and do my sessions surrounded by nature. There’s a great track with 13 lanes, so you’re not too tightly packed. You’re surrounded by mountains, it’s stunning.</p><p><strong>How far would you like to go? Which races do you dream about? What would you like to have on your palmarès?</strong><br>As far as possible – I’d probably say the Olympics, because everyone says the Olympics! The award I’d like on my palmarès is an Olympic medal, like most athletes, I suppose. It’s something that’s lodged in my mind: if it wasn’t there I would have stopped a long time ago. Whenever I do something, I don’t quit; I’ve had a lot of hiccups, lots of injuries, but as long as that flame is burning in my mind, I won’t quit.</p><p><strong>What’s your favourite session, and your favourite place to train?</strong><br>The place I like to train best is here in Grenoble. Sometimes when I’ve had enough I like going to Monte Gordo, I like Boulouris, but here is where I feel really good. I don’t really have a favourite workout. If I had to choose I’d say 1,600 – 400 and then intervals at 1,500m pace. I don’t like getting bored during training, I like a bit of everything. If I’m doing intervals for a 1,500 I like having done a tempo run two or three days before; when I’ve done too much threshold, I like running easily on the track. I do really like the track.</p><p><strong>Tell us a bit about <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8652709\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your segment</a> then – what is unique about it and why does it represent you well?</strong><br>I’m a 1,500 metre runner, so it’s a bit difficult to find a 1,500-metre segment, but in general good 1,500-metre runners are good over 1,000-metres. There’s a 1,000-metre segment on the Bachelard track, often guys really push it in the 1,500-metre races and fly through the 1,000. I don’t yet have the CR, it’s a good way of seeing what you can do.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8652709\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/58_5feb2ce68782d-736x640.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"736\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/58_5feb2ce68782d-736x640.png 736w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/58_5feb2ce68782d-614x534.png 614w, https://1n4rcn88bk4ziht713dla5ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/58_5feb2ce68782d.png 745w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\"></a></p><p><strong>Strava recently launched the ‘Local Legend’ achievement: where do people see you running most? Do you feel you’re already the most recognised runner in town?</strong><br>I’ve not got that yet! It hasn’t been out long and as I’ve been pretty injured recently I haven’t run or trained much. I know that my buddy Ghislain Airiau was happy to become the Local Legend at <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/9232230\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Font Romeu</a> [the French national altitude centre in the Pyrenees] over 400 metres, because guys like Mo Farah used to train there. Here I’ve never got it because I haven’t trained much recently, though I’ve been on the track a lot. I’ve done 45-minute runs in lane eight, it sends you round and round!</p><p><strong>At your level, you obviously must take a lot of segment Course Records when training. Is this something you pay attention to and do you ever go CR hunting?</strong><br>Yes, during the lockdown I got a lot – there’s a park next to my place called <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/8122980\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paul Mistral</a>, I had a little look at segments and went to take them. I don’t have them all but I’ve got quite a few – four or five around Parc Mistral. I like having a look to see if they’re ripe for the taking. I’m not going to go crazy and injure myself, but I have been in the middle of an easy run, seen a segment, and put the hammer down, that’s pretty fun!</p><p><strong>So what advice do you have to beat your best time on your segment? Do you know anyone who could take it from you?</strong><br>Train hard! There’s quite a few in Grenoble who could get it, I think, because the CR is 2’30” [for a kilometre]. I don’t know what I’d run today, but in my group there’s the two Airiau brothers (<a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/16590819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghislain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/17314705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gatien</a>), Esteban, <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/17849304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fabien</a>, who do the 800 in 1’50”, so they could run a 2’30”. If I introduced them to it, there’s a good chance they’d try to get one up on me and one day I’d get that Strava email…</p><p><strong>Do you have an suggestions for clubs or athletes to follow on Strava?</strong><br>There’s a club here called <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/clubs/335479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strava Grenoble</a> that I created, with a lot of people in it – I think there are 1,000 members. I just made it for a laugh with my friends, but it’s doing well. I’m also going to say <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/16590819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ghislain Airiau</a>, because he’s a good friend of mine, and [the pro cyclist] <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/pros/1805247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lilian Calmejane</a>, I look at his activities a lot.</p><p><strong>Follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/11688123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quentin</a>&nbsp;on Strava.</strong><br><strong>Discover the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments-series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Segments Series</a>.</strong></p></div></article></div>","author":"Lionel Fracture","siteTitle":"Strava","siteHash":"1aad548e4b317c88a2037e855444a0a9609f710eecec184d87146b59efcbecdb","entryHash":"3d40b6cc9560f74b01eab27165ce0861d39701ed2f60fb4a987cba241985a0c4","category":"Cycling"}
