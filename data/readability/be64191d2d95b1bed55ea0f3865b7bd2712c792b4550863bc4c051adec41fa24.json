The ten short, steep climbs that litter the route mean that the De Ronde is always one of the most difficult and iconic races of the season.</span></p><p><span><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a>&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-womens-2021-early-season-a-guide\">Related –&nbsp;</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-womens-2021-early-season-a-guide\"><strong><span>The Women's 2021 Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</span></strong></a></em></span></p><p><span><em><strong><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032619-013_1024x_0c906a4f-5e97-47c8-b0ee-010fafea8b37_1024x1024.jpg?v=1615581103\" alt=\"\"></span></strong></em></span></p><h4><span><span>Route</span></span></h4><p><span>The flat, cobbled sections earlier in the race will cause early selections. Teams such as SD Worx will likely want to split the race so they can create a small group which they will hope to be well represented in. If they follow the tactics that worked well for them in Het Nieuwsblad, we can expect to see them sending attacks up the road and controlling any responses from the peloton.</span></p><p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Tour_of_Flanders_2021_women_route_600x600.png?v=1615570653\" alt=\"\"></span></p><p><span>The steep climbs such as the Kwaremont and Paterberg that follow later will be a challenge for some of the pure sprinters. Teams without big contenders for a bunch kick will be approaching riding these climbs fast, hoping to reduce the chances for riders with such fast legs making it to the line.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Contenders</span></h4><p><span>Canyon SRAM Racing will be working hard to position Kasia Niewiadoma well going into the late climbs. Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig will also be hoping to use her climbing talents to get away in a small group towards the end of the race.</span></p><p><span>The big names such as Van Der Breggen and Van Vlueten may use the Kapelmuur as a springboard for some trademark long range attacks. Coming at 60km to go, they will hit the climb at a perfect point to launch any surprise moves early on in the race and whittle the group down to a select few.</span></p><div><form novalidate=\"\" isembed=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div><div component=\"[object Object]\" alignment=\"center\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><img imageratio=\"0.008333333333333333\" src=\"https://d3k81ch9hvuctc.cloudfront.net/company/JQVLkV/images/92cf782c-a79d-4080-a0a0-9b006716be2d.png\" tabindex=\"-1\"></p></div><div data-gramm=\"false\" contenteditable=\"false\" component=\"[object Object]\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><span>Subscribe to our women's newsletter,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>produced in association with Rapha, to receive</span></p><p><span>a weekly complement of racing, gear and cycling</span></p><p><span>culture focussed on women</span></p></div><div component=\"[object Object]\" alignment=\"center\" formcomponentstyling=\"[object Object]\" data-testid=\"form-row\" formcomponenttheme=\"[object Object]\"><p><img imageratio=\"0.008333333333333333\" src=\"https://d3k81ch9hvuctc.cloudfront.net/company/JQVLkV/images/92cf782c-a79d-4080-a0a0-9b006716be2d.png\" tabindex=\"-1\"></p></div></div></form></div><p><span>Sprinters like former winner Marta Bastianelli, however, could spoil the fun for the climbers. If a bunch comes to the flat run towards Oudenaarde, there could be some dangerous riders still left to contest a sprint finish. Someone like Emma Noorsgard will need to dig deep to make it over the steep climbs, but if she does, she has every chance going one better than her second place at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</span></p><p><span>So, perhaps this race is best suited to riders who can hold the wheel on shorter climbs and make it over the crest, but also pack a punch at the finish. Third and fourth in last year’s edition of the race, Lotte Kopecky and Lisa Brennauer are good examples of riders with these strengths.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-femmes-2021-preview\"><em><strong>Related – Paris-Roubaix Femmes 2021 Preview</strong></em></a></p><p><span>The weather could also be a crucial factor, rain and wind will make the race hectic and perhaps increase the probability of a smaller group coming to the finish. If we see milder conditions, the race will be harder to split.</span></p><p><span>As with all the best cobbled classics, the unpredictability is part of the appeal – and so we look forward to being surprised at what Flanders has to throw at us.</span></p></div></div></article></div></div>","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"be64191d2d95b1bed55ea0f3865b7bd2712c792b4550863bc4c051adec41fa24","category":"Cycling"}
