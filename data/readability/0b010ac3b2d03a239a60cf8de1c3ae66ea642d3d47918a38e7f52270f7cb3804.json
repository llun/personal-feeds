Originally on a two-year contract to the end of 2022, the Spanish team will hold onto Norsgaard through the next Olympic cycle.</p><p>Norsgaard is without question one of the breakout stars of 2021, and it’s only June. The Danish national champion started her season with second at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, winning the bunch sprint behind a solo Anna van der Breggen. Next, she notched second at Le Samyn des Dames. Hey first win of the year was on the first road stage of the Ceratizit Festival Elsy Jacobs at the beginning of May. That stage win opened the flood gates. Norsgaard proceeded to win the next stage, the general classification, the youth classification, and the sprint jersey. A few weeks later she won the opening stage of the Internationale LOTTO Thüringen Ladies Tour.</p><p>In the WorldTour races, she has consistently placed within the top 10 and was second at the Oxyclean Classic Brugge-De Panne.</p><p>Norsgaard has previously stated she enjoys the atmosphere and teamwork at the Movistar Team, and this contract alongside her results prove it.</p><p>“It’s been such an amazing year for me so far, and the Movistar Team have put so much confidence on what I can do,” Norsgaard said of the extention. “I really trust this project, and that’s what has moved me to sign for another two years with this team. I’m really looking forward to what the future holds for us together. Vamos!“</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>At only 21 years of age, 2021 has proved to be an impressive first season on a World Tour level team for Norsgaard. She is the first rider Movistar has signed through 2024, although four other riders have contracts with the Spanish team in 2023.</p><p>“Emma’s contract extension was crucial to our team’s future,” said team manager Sebastián Unzué. “She’s quickly built a reputation as one of the best riders in the world, as shown in both one-day races, where she’s fought for victories against the top contenders in the peloton, and stageraces. She’s also rose as one of the best sprinters in the world, another reason why it was so important for us to have her aboard mid / long-term, so we could build a strong team around her. She’s a rider we expect -and she’s already taking on that role- to be one of our leaders in the future. We’re sure she’ll be a reference for this organisation in the upcoming years.”</p></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0b010ac3b2d03a239a60cf8de1c3ae66ea642d3d47918a38e7f52270f7cb3804","category":"Cycling"}
