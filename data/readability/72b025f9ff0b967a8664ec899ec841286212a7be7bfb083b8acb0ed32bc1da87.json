Apple discusses multiple different pin designs that would connect the charger to the device. The patent shows a pin that is more round in one image, while another shows a more flat-surface design.</p><p>The patent itself doesn't mention or reference an ‌iPhone‌ by name, but an image in the filing depicts what seems to be the bottom of an ‌iPhone‌ with the ‌MagSafe‌ charger concept. Compared to the current Lightning port on the ‌iPhone‌, ‌MagSafe‌ has its advantages. Based on a set of magnets, ‌MagSafe‌ allows the device to easily detach from the charger if it gets tripped on or yanked.</p><p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2021 03 03 at 11\" width=\"1270\" height=\"1492\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/wS8fUEha7qTcYtcpyPoexcLwe5M=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png?lossy\" data-src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/wS8fUEha7qTcYtcpyPoexcLwe5M=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png?lossy\" data-srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/wS8fUEha7qTcYtcpyPoexcLwe5M=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/MEWKGV8Vo4LHrivJKPSTPcsDp_s=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/95WHBfmMPrEW7xrrK23i6IDJZHM=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/EnzsNMvcgk_lmNalS98FG9oHvNM=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png 2500w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" sizes=\"748px\" srcset=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/wS8fUEha7qTcYtcpyPoexcLwe5M=/400x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/MEWKGV8Vo4LHrivJKPSTPcsDp_s=/800x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/95WHBfmMPrEW7xrrK23i6IDJZHM=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/EnzsNMvcgk_lmNalS98FG9oHvNM=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale():quality(90)/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png 2500w\"><br>With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup, Apple reintroduced ‌MagSafe‌ in the form of large circular magnets on the back of the device.

Kuo states that USB-C has lower specifications compared to Lightning and ‌MagSafe‌. Kuo specifically says that if an ‌iPhone‌ in the future abandons Lighting, it would immediately adopt a portless design with ‌MagSafe‌.</p><p>Apple is expected to bring ‌MagSafe‌ back to the Mac, according to both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/macbook-pro-better-displays-faster-magsafe-charging/\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">Kuo</a>.
