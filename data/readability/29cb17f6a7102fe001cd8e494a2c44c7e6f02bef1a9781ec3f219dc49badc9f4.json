Meaning that you can now order one from <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/bicycles.html?refine=||Brand_attr-INTENSE&amp;searchProvider=lucidworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costco.com</a> and have it shipped directly to your door.</p><p>We’re assuming that these will ship in a box, in a partially assembled state. So expect to have to know how to safely put it together before your first ride.</p><h2>Why would someone order an Intense from Costco?</h2><p>Both the 951 XC and Trail bike are available, and priced at $3,249 which includes standard shipping. On top of&nbsp;<em>that</em>, Costco Executive members will likely get 2% back on the purchase, and if you purchase it with your Costco Visa, you’ll get an additional 2% cash back, bringing the total purchase price down by more than $500 compared to the listed retail price of $3,699.</p><p>Then there’s Costco’s legendary return policy to consider. There’s nothing to indicate that a 951 bike wouldn’t fall under their usual return policy, which means if you order it and decide the size is wrong, or you just don’t like it, you could&nbsp;<em>probably</em> just return it to your local store, no questions asked.</p><p>Finally, there’s the question of availability. While most of the industry seems to be running dry on new bikes, these are in stock and ready to ship. Today. Not only that, but their standard shipping is via UPS ground and it’s estimated to deliver in 3-5 days depending on your location. Not fast enough? They also offer express shipping for around $70 to get it there sooner.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Costco Intense 951 bike specs\" width=\"1445\" height=\"583\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike.jpg 1445w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-297x120.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-800x323.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-120x48.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-768x310.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-696x281.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-1068x431.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-1041x420.jpg 1041w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1445px) 100vw, 1445px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb19 src ng ngcb19 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike.jpg 1445w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-297x120.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-800x323.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-120x48.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-768x310.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-696x281.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-1068x431.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/23121353/Intense-951-mountain-bikes-available-for-purchase-through-costco-website-2021-trail-bike-1041x420.jpg 1041w\"></a></p><p>The move to make bikes available through Costco.com is likely to make prospective buyers happy by saving some coin. But it’s also sure to anger dealers already hard-hit by limited inventory, so it will be interesting to see how this plays out in the long run for Intense.</p></div></div>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"29cb17f6a7102fe001cd8e494a2c44c7e6f02bef1a9781ec3f219dc49badc9f4","category":"Cycling"}
