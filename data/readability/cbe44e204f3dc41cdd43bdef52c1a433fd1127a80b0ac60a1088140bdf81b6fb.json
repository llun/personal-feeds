Mauri Vansevenant led into the last few hundred meters for his Deceuninck-QuickStep teammate Julian Alaphilippe, but van der Poel exploded past with 250 meters to go. He immediately opened a sizable gap to the rest of the field and held on to take another convincing victory, his second win of the race and his sixth of the season.</p><p>Christophe Laporte (Cofidis) sprinted to runner-up honors on the day with Alaphilippe taking third. Van der Poel’s stage victory also propelled him to the top of the GC standings, where he now leads Alaphilippe by one second.</p><div><div><p>Tour de Suisse (2.UWT) <span>Lachen → Pfaffnau</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/dc/mathieu-van-der-poel-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"cbe44e204f3dc41cdd43bdef52c1a433fd1127a80b0ac60a1088140bdf81b6fb","category":"Cycling"}
