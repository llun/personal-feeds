The 26-year-old Dutchman is among the bookmakers’ top favorites for the race alongside defending champion <strong>Wout van Aert</strong> and 2019 winner <strong>Julian Alaphilippe</strong>, and he confirmed that he sees them as top contenders.</p><p>“Those two are the big names. I also see Michael Matthews, and he has a fast sprint. I think he will be a guy to watch,” Van der Poel said. “I think Wout has a little bit of an advantage because he has already won the race. For him, it’s a bit easier, for sure, it will be a new race. Normally, San Remo is an honest race, and normally the strongest wins there as well.”</p><p>Van der Poel also touched on the topic of attacking on the Cipressa, which tops out around 23 km from the finish.</p><p>“It would be extremely nice to get over Cipressa with a small group and go to the Poggio for sure,” he said. “But I don’t know if you attack there, you’ll get many guys with you, and the part between them is fast so you’re at a disadvantage against a bunch.”</p><h3>Majerus joins UCI Safety Commission</h3><p>The <strong>CPA Women</strong> announced on Thursday that <strong>Christine Majerus</strong> has joined the UCI Safety Commission as a rider representative alongside <strong>Matteo Trentin</strong> and <strong>Philippe Gilbert</strong>.</p><p>The commission includes representatives of various stakeholders involved in professional cycling but prior to the addition of Majerus, it did not include any rider representatives from the women’s peloton.</p><h3>Tribunal deems Freeman’s fitness to practice ‘impaired’</h3><p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/18/richard-freemans-fitness-to-practise-medicine-is-impaired-tribunal-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Guardian</a> reports, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal has deemed <strong>Richard Freeman’s</strong> fitness to practice medicine “impaired.” The tribunal will now consider possible sanctions for the former Sky and British Cycling doctor.</p><p>Freeman was found guilty last week of having ordered testosterone to British Cycling headquarters “knowing or believing” it was for a rider.</p><p>“The tribunal bore in mind that Dr Freeman’s misconduct involved a number of significant elements, including serious dishonesty, as well as behavior which could have placed patients at unwarranted risk of harm,” read a statement from the tribunal on Thursday. “It concluded that public confidence in the profession would be undermined if a finding of impairment were not made. The tribunal has therefore determined that Dr Freeman’s fitness to practice is impaired by reason of his misconduct.”</p><h3>Former NBA player Shawn Bradley paralyzed after being hit by driver</h3><p>According to a statement from the Dallas Mavericks, former NBA player <strong>Shawn Bradley</strong> was left paralyzed after being hit by a motorist while riding his bike in January.</p><p>Bradley, 48, was hit from behind while riding his bike in St. George, Utah, a block away from home. Following the collision, he underwent neck surgery and has spent eight weeks in the hospital.</p><p>“With his wife Carrie at his side around the clock, and supported by an amazing team of rehabilitation specialists and family, Bradley is in good spirits,” read the statement from the Dallas Mavericks. “He plans to use his accident as a platform to bring greater public awareness to the importance of bicycle safety.”</p><h2>Coming Up …</h2><p>While plenty of stars are gearing up for Saturday’s Milan-San Remo, a handful of big names will be racing on Friday at the Bredene Koksijde Classic. The UCI 1.Pro-rated event will take riders 199 km on Belgian roads. There are a few cobbled sectors and a few climbs midway through the race, but a flat run-in to the line will have the fast finishers eyeing a win. Mads Pedersen and Tim Merlier will be riders to watch, while Deceuninck-Quick-Step will have multiple options, including Florian Sénéchal and Mark Cavendish.</p><h2>In case you missed it …</h2><ul><li>Matt de Neef has the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/preview-your-guide-to-the-2021-milan-san-remo/\">preview</a> of Milan-San Remo with the things you need to know ahead of Saturday’s race.</li><li>If <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/the-best-bike-race-bracket-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">making a bracket</a> to predict how a run-off vote determining the world’s best bike race might turn out sounds like something you’d be interested in, you’re in luck!</li></ul><div><h5>Tags</h5></div></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"45c33c0be6de60b1a2346b7808c77f21c41ffcd5960580ff12575c12f7d61647","category":"Cycling"}
