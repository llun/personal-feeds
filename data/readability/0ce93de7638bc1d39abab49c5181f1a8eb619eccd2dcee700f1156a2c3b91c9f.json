The app requires users to be invited to the app to use it, making it somewhat exclusive for users who are lucky enough to have an account. The data from App Annie shows that as of February 1, the app had obtained 3.5 million downloads. A little more than two weeks later, that number more than doubled to 8.1 million.</p><p><a href=\"https://bvajresh.medium.com/charting-the-growth-of-clubhouse-audio-app-9672aaa82f80\">Estimates</a> beyond <em>App Annie</em> indicate that downloads for the app could be as high as 10 million. The significant uptick in downloads could be attributed to appearances on the app by Tesla founder Elon Musk, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Clubhouse, when contacted for comment on the statistics by <em>TechCrunch</em>, says that it doesn't disclose user numbers.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</a></h3><p>Tuesday February 16, 2021 1:31 pm PST by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/\" rel=\"author\">Joe Rossignol</a></p><p>Apple today informed Apple Authorized Service Providers that it will be introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.
