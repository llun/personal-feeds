When attempting to download a Shortcut from one of these links, there was an error about the shortcut link being invalid.</p><p>This impacted many websites that share various Shortcuts, such as <em><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/\">MacStories</a></em>, which houses a repository of useful shortcuts created by Federico Viticci. Last night, Apple told Viticci it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1374925965239914496\">working on a fix</a> to restore the broken shortcuts.</p><blockquote><p>We are aware of an issue where previously shared shortcuts are currently unavailable. Newly shared shortcuts are available, and we are working to restore previously shared shortcuts as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote><p>As of this morning, Viticci said that many of the <em>MacStories</em> shortcuts are once again functional, and we can confirm that most of the Shortcut links we tested from <em>MacStories</em>, <a href=\"https://routinehub.co/\">RoutineHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/\">Reddit</a> are working.</p><p>We recently shared a video on some handy <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> shortcuts for everything from editing photos to adding frames to screenshots to dictating notes, and the links to those shortcuts are all functional again.</p></div></article><p></p><h2>Top Stories</h2><p></p><div><h3><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">iPhone 13 Front Glass Reveals Smaller Notch With Earpiece Relocated to Top Bezel</a></h3><p>iPhone 13 models are widely expected to feature a smaller notch, and we are able to share a first look at the potential design.
