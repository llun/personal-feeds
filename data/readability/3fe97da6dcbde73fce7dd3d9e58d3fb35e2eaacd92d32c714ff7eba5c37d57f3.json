{"title":"ZwiftHub lives on – last-minute acquisition saves the Zwift app","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/zwifthub-lives-on-last-minute-acquisition-saves-the-zwift-app/","date":1619656121000,"content":"<div><div><p>Earlier this month we brought you the news that the popular web-based app <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/screenshot-your-progress-zwifthub-is-closing-down/\" target=\"_blank\">ZwiftHub</a> was to shut down at the end of this month. Now, within days of that sad end, Zwift Insider has announced the acquisition of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/01/zwifthub-gives-you-the-features-zwift-really-should/\" target=\"_blank\">ZwiftHub</a> and the continuation of its features.</p><p>Zwift Insider is a community-driven site, maintained by a small independent group. The site is already one of the most popular resources for all things Zwift. First launched in 2015, the site features more than 2,300 community-sourced articles sharing tips, tricks, news, and even speed tests ranking the <a href=\"https://zwiftinsider.com/charts-frames/\" target=\"_blank\">fastest frames</a> in the game. The acquisition of ZwiftHub brings two of the most popular third-party Zwift resources under one roof. While Zwift Insider is independent of Zwift, Zwift does provide some funding to the site.</p><p>“Toby did some very fine work with ZwiftHub, and we knew Zwifters were happily using it every day. So we contacted him and began discussing the possibility of taking over the site,” said Eric Schlange of Zwift Insider in an <a href=\"https://zwiftinsider.com/zwifthub-acquired/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement article</a>. “We’re happy to announce that we’ve reached an agreement wherein ZwiftHub will continue to thrive under the Zwift Insider umbrella and expand as Zwift adds new routes!”</p><p>Tobias Fenney, the programmer who created ZwiftHub as his first coding project said “Whilst I really wanted ZwiftHub to continue, it was most important to me to find someone who acts in the best interest of the users going forward. With Eric it’s not just someone but probably the best one taking care of my creation in the future.”</p><p>This acquisition means users of both sites can continue to avail themselves of ZwiftHub features including Zwift route details and achievement trackers.</p></div></div>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3fe97da6dcbde73fce7dd3d9e58d3fb35e2eaacd92d32c714ff7eba5c37d57f3","category":"Cycling"}
