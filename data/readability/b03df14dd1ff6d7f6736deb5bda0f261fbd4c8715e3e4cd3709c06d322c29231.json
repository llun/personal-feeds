Customers use BIG-IP servers to manage traffic going into and out of large networks. Tasks include load balancing, DDoS mitigation, and web application security.</p><p>Last week, F5 disclosed and patched <a href=\"https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K02566623\">critical BIG-IP vulnerabilities</a> that allow hackers to gain complete control of a server. Despite a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, the security flaws got overshadowed by a different set of critical vulnerabilities <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/03/microsoft-issues-emergency-patches-for-4-exploited-0days-in-exchange/\">Microsoft disclosed and patched in Exchange server</a> a week earlier. Within a few days of Microsoft's emergency update, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/tens-of-thousands-of-us-organizations-hit-in-ongoing-microsoft-exchange-hack/\">tens of thousands of Exchange servers</a> in the US were compromised.</p><h2>Day of reckoning</h2><p>When security researchers weren’t busy attending to the unfolding Exchange mass compromise, many of them warned that it was only a matter of time before the F5 vulnerabilities also came under attack. Now, that day has come.</p><p>Researchers at security firm NCC Group on Friday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/buffaloverflow/status/1372861157317435394\">said</a> they’re “seeing full chain exploitation” of CVE-2021-22986, a vulnerability that allows remote attackers with no password or other credentials to execute commands of their choice on vulnerable BIG-IP devices.</p><p>“After seeing lots of broken exploits and failed attempts, we are now seeing successful in the wild exploitation of this vulnerability, as of this morning,” Rich Warren, an NCC Group researcher wrote.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/03/18/rift-detection-capabilities-for-recent-f5-big-ip-big-iq-icontrol-rest-api-vulnerabilities-cve-2021-22986/\">blog post</a> NCC Group posted a screenshot showing exploit code that could successfully steal an authenticated session token, which is a type of browser cookie that allows administrators to use a web-based programming interface to remotely control BIG-IP hardware.</p><figure><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/f5-exploit.png\" data-height=\"460\" data-width=\"1024\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/f5-exploit-640x288.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/f5-exploit.png 2x\"></a><figcaption><p>NCC Group</p></figcaption></figure><p>Security firm Palo Alto Networks, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1373017186818781190\">said</a> that CVE-2021-22986 was being targeted by a devices infected with a <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/mirai-variant-iot-vulnerabilities/\">variant</a> of the open-source Mirai malware. The tweet said the variant was “attempting to exploit” the vulnerability, but it wasn’t clear if the attempts were successful.</p><p>Other researchers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1372818419611885576\">reported</a> Internet-wide scans designed to locate BIG-IP servers that are vulnerable.</p><p>CVE-2021-22986 is only one of several critical BIG-IP vulnerabilities F5 disclosed and patched last week. The severity In part is because the vulnerabilities require limited skill to exploit. But more importantly, once attackers have control of a BIG-IP server, they are more or less inside the security perimeter of the network using it. That means attackers can quickly access other sensitive parts of the network.</p><p>As if admins didn’t already have enough to attend to, patching vulnerable BIG-IP servers and looking for exploits should be a top priority. NCC Group provided indicators of compromise in the link above, and Palo Alto Networks has IOCs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1372818419611885576\">here</a>.</p></div></div>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b03df14dd1ff6d7f6736deb5bda0f261fbd4c8715e3e4cd3709c06d322c29231","category":"Tech"}
