Rolled out of the house around 4am on Saturday, got to Yosemite later that afternoon, snapped a photo with half dome in the background there, turned around and rode home. 400 mile round trip. Also snapped a photo of my obligatory midnight in-n-out burger – the double double around mile 340… because it’s basically a double double century. Seemed fitting. We got home around 4am on Sunday morning.</p><p>I started doing rides like this a few years ago by riding to and from places that i absolutely hated goin to via car as a kid… sitting in the back seat of my parents car for 4 hours counting telephone poles was absolutely friggin miserable as a 10 year old, but somehow 20 years later, getting to and from those same exact places by bike… ain’t all that bad. 10/10 ill do it again.”</p><p>We always love seeing photos from where you are riding and are happy to share them with our readers around&nbsp;the world here on the Pic Of The Day.
