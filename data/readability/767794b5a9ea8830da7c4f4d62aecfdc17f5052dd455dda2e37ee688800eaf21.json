For 3T, it was a step by step learning process which started with the Torno crankset. To keep things simple, the Torno started with more standard carbon fiber sheets, but with so called ‘dry fiber’. That means that unlike preimpregnated carbon fiber, the resin hasn’t been added yet. 3T claims that this allows for the creation of more complex shapes, while also opening up more types of carbon fiber to be used.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104859/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-19.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

This saves time and energy from constantly warming and cooling each mold before use. Then, once the frame is inside the mold, the resin is injected and cured, which with the right technique, results in a better surface finish without the need for huge amounts of hand finishing.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13.jpg\" alt=\"3T Italian frameset production with filament winding\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb18 src ng ngcb18 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16104828/3t-in-house-carbon-manufacturing-made-in-Italy-frames-13-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a>Additionally, the dry fiber has advantages that 3T was planning to utilize when they made the move to frame production.
