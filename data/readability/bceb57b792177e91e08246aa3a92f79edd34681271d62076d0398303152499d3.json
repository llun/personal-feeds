While the new AirPods may look similar to the AirPods Pro, they are not expected to feature Active Noise Cancellation.</p><p>\"Kang\" also shared their belief that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will outsell the 11-inch model in 2021, suggesting that the next-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro could have at least one exclusive feature compared to the 11-inch model. Apple is widely rumored to have a new iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display in the pipeline, but most rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mini-led-ipad-pro-release-date-rumor/\">have only mentioned the 12.9-inch model</a>, so perhaps Mini-LED will be exclusive to the 12.9-inch model.</p><p>The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/03/ipad-pro-5g-a14x-mini-led-2021-rumor/\">faster A14X chip and support for 5G networks</a> on models with cellular connectivity.
