Felix Lowe tries to makes sense of it all</strong></p><p><strong>Words</strong>: Felix Lowe <strong>Photography</strong>: Veloimages; KBMB</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE Team Emirates</a> missed a trick when they failed to announce their latest recruit with the accompaniment of Bonnie Tyler’s song ‘Here She Comes’. Geddit – Hirschi comes? Never mind.</p><p>Marc Hirschi’s controversial arrival from Sunweb raised eyebrows, coming as it did after a mysterious contract severance that required a non-disclosure agreement. We can only speculate, but&nbsp;a hefty pay hike may have played a part.</p><p>And so the man who made ripples on his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> debut last year will join the man who won it on his own debut, with the stylish Swiss putting his personal ambitions on hold in support of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tadej Pogačar</a>.</p><p>The Slovenian sensation will have extra support in the form of Rafał Majka (from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bora-hansgrohe\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a>) and Matteo Trentin (from CCC) as UAE beef up their roster. As for Hirschi, perhaps he felt cramped by the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/romain-bardet\">Romain Bardet</a> at Sunweb, which has now morphed into the new-look <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-dsm\">Team DSM</a>, and whose black kit with a double blue stripe down the middle is a nod to the Sky togs of old.</p><p>DSM are certainly struggling to keep their best assets. A year after losing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-dumoulin\">Tom Dumoulin</a> they have lost Wilco Kelderman to Bora-Hansgrohe and Michael Matthews to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-bikeexchange\">the latest GreenEdge generation</a>. The Australian team are now BikeExchange, which&nbsp;is appropriate having just exchanged their Scott bikes for Bianchis.</p><div id=\"file-44054\"><p><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/03/team_musical_chairs_2_ag2r.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" alt=\"\"></p></div><p>The Aussie team was also home to the previously inseparable Yates twins, but now only Simon is staying Down Under while brother Adam jumps&nbsp;ship to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-ineos\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>, where he’s joined by fellow Brit <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\">Tom Pidcock</a> on his first senior pro contract, and the Aussie veteran <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/richie-porte\">Richie Porte</a>, who returns following a career-first Tour podium with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/trek-segafredo\">Trek-Segafredo</a>.</p><p>Ineos have looked to weaken rivals <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\">Jumbo-Visma</a> by poaching the promising Belgian Laurens De Plus, who will be replaced by another DSM defector in Dutchman Sam Oomen. The Killer Bees are otherwise largely unchanged – although they have,&nbsp;unlike Ineos, moved with the times&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/8823/jumbo-visma-announce-womens-team-for-2021\">by launching a women’s team</a>.</p><p>Three-time world champion Marianne Vos comes in as figurehead (quite a coup given they are not yet in the WorldTour) while CCC-Liv, the team she still co-owns, have also lost the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/9302/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no12-ashleigh-moolman-pasio\">inaugural Esports World Champion Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio</a> to SD Worx.</p><p>The CCC men’s team, meanwhile, have been bought out by Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux, who join the top table with little Louis Meintjes as their GC capture from Education First.</p><p>That team is now <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ef-education-nippo\">EF Education-Nippo</a>, and as well as losing Meintjes they are witnessing the exodus of Dauphiné champion Dani Martínez to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/team-ineos\">Ineos Grenadiers</a>, and Michael Woods and Sep Vanmarcke to the burgeoning retirement powerhouse that is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/israel-start-up-nation\">Israel Start-Up Nation</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dennismags.co.uk/cyclist\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/clickable_subs_promo.jpg\" alt=\"click to subscribe\"></a></p><p>Already at the team is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/chris-froome\">Chris Froome</a>, who may struggle to rediscover the form that won him four Tours but will sport one of the best new kits in the peloton – a slick dark blue and white number that will also cover the torsos of Daryl Impey and Alessandro De Marchi.</p><p>Most interestingly, ISUN have made a huge statement <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/9297/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no7-cherie-pridham\">by bringing in Cherie Pridham</a>, the first female directeur sportif in the men’s WorldTour.</p><p>Talking of kits it would be remiss&nbsp;not to mention <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ag2r-citroen\">AG2R-Citroën</a>, who now sport a sponsor-heavy sash jersey that is even more Marmite than their continued dedication to brown shorts.</p><p>Maybe that’s what scared Bardet off, but the team is no weaker for his absence thanks to the recent arrivals of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/greg-van-avermaet\">Greg Van Avermaet</a> from CCC, Bob Jungels from QuickStep, Ben O’Connor from NTT and Lilian Calmejane from Direct Énergie.</p><p>One team that certainly looks weaker going into 2021 is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/astana\">Astana</a>. The Kazakh-backed team have lost their main GC threat, Miguel Ángel López, who joins veteran Alejandro Valverde at Movistar <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/8964/miguel-angel-lopez-leaves-astana-for-movistar\">despite their previous war of words</a>.</p><p>Thankfully <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9142/netflix-and-movistar-to-return-for-a-second-series-this-spring\">Netflix is on board to film the fireworks for a second series</a>. Movistar are further strengthened on the women’s side by the arrival of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/9293/cyclists-31-inspirational-women-no3-annemiek-van-vleuten\">Dutch superstar Annemiek van Vleuten</a>.</p><p>Having <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/9001/rod-ellingworth-leaves-bahrain-mclaren\">never really settled at Bahrain-McLaren</a>, manager Rod Ellingworth has rejoined Ineos as director of racing while his former protégé <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\">Mark Cavendish</a> swaps the red kit of the newly minted Bahrain Victorious <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/9117/what-will-mark-cavendish-bring-to-deceuninck-quickstep\">for the dark blue of Deceuninck-QuickStep</a>.</p><p>Cav may struggle to win the four Tour stages he needs to draw level with Merckx’s record, but he’ll be relieved&nbsp;to have one last throw of the dice with his former team. And on his own road&nbsp;to recovery, Fabio Jakobsen couldn’t have a better mentor.</p></div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"ee29222cdabf6fda2efe5b65bcf65b2c9c502160375660be95193cbd04974b26","category":"Cycling"}
