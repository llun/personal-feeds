Of course, in 2018 no one could have guessed what would happen between 2019-2021. When most large companies and distributors reviewed their orders last spring, they were afraid of further developments due to the pandemic and they cut orders for components whenever they could</em>,” explains Michael Moureček, co-founder of Festka, a composite road bike frame producer. In the US, many companies in the cycling industry even laid off employees. Now, they are unable to get those employees back so they can ramp up production to respond to growing demand.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon.jpg\" alt=\"Festka CompoTech carbon\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130711/Cycling-a-bittersweet-winner-of-the-coronavirus-crisis_Festka-editorial-carbon-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>Cycling is an extremely globalized industry. Let’s take wheels as an example: carbon rims are produced in China where production was disrupted in the spring of 2019. As soon as China got going again, the pandemic had reached Portugal where wheel hubs are made. It then spread to Belgium where the wire production is concentrated and then on to the Czech Republic where wheels are built. This is what the situation looks like around the world: one type of bicycle component is made from various raw materials found in different parts of the world where mining and processing had been disrupted at various times during the first wave of the pandemic. When these materials are not all available at once, the entire supply chain breaks down and huge delays occur.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Festka-Tomski-Polanski-ART-series-custom-painted-carbon-Cinelli-RAM-bar-600x400.jpg 600w\"></a></p><p>Many manufacturers are currently experiencing a lack of production materials. For example, wax, which is necessary for the manufacture of some high-end handlebars, is nowadays extremely hard to find. Another important ingredient that is lacking is acetone needed for the production of paints. “<em>We can’t get wheel hubs. It is not that our German partner cannot produce them, but there is currently not enough high-quality aluminium on the market</em>,” explains Moureček. The pandemic has caused a lot of micro-crises and shortcomings, which are now further linked and interconnected, causing longer and longer delivery times. For example, the lead time for carbon composite forks has grown from a couple of months to a couple of years!</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Festka-Doppler-for-Nespresso_one-off-carbonaluminum-track-bike-project_recycled-alloy-from-used-Nespresso-coffee-capsules_tubing-600x400.jpg 600w\"></a></p><p>It is not only production that is affected by all this. The pandemic is also causing delays in R&amp;D. This has certainly been the case at Festka. “<em>Because of this, we were unable to complete the planned launch of two new frame models, as we are not independent here.

Many customers prefer to buy framesets only and then get them built into full bikes by a trusted mechanic. Frame manufacturers typically do not make forks and they rely on those being supplied by specialists. “For example, at the beginning of April, one of our American component suppliers extended delivery times from five weeks to five months. They recently added another five months to that. So their lead time is close to a year now, and we have several dozen bikes on order that we cannot finish without forks,” says Michael Moureček.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04.jpg\" alt=\"Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04.jpg 2048w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04.jpg 2048w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Festka-ONE-Gravel-custom-carbon_post-race_photo-by-Jesper-Grundahl_04-600x400.jpg 600w\"></a></p><p><strong>It’s not just about new bikes</strong><br>Those lucky individuals who do not need to buy a new bike will also soon encounter problems caused by the pandemic. Bike shops will simply not have spare parts needed for repairs and maintenance. “<em>This is a topic that is not so visible, or talked about, at the moment because reports concentrate on new bike sales,</em>” says Moureček. “<em>One of our clients who recently bought a bike happened to damage his derailleur in a minor accident. He came to us at Festka asking if we could help him. We then had to tell him: Yes, of course, but you are in for a fourteen-month wait. It’s unbelievable!</em>”</p><p>The components necessary for the most basic bike servicing but which are currently most scarce on the market include brake pads and chains. “<em>We would normally buy chains by the hundreds, but this is not possible anymore. Neither directly from manufacturers nor in their e-shops because you can now only buy one piece of any given component per day,</em>” says Michael Moureček. For large bike shops or bike service stations, one hundred chains equals roughly a week’s supply. If these repair shops can only buy seven chains a week, they cannot do their most basic job. Stretched, worn chains gradually wear down more expensive components such as chainrings and cassettes.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling a bittersweet winner of the coronavirus crisis an editorial by Michael Moureček, co-founder of Festka workshop\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-768x432.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-1536x864.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-696x392.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-1068x601.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-747x420.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2.jpg 1600w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-768x432.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-1536x864.jpg 1536w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-696x392.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-1068x601.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130153/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop2-747x420.jpg 747w\"></a></p><p><strong>Covid and the revolution in cycling</strong><br>Covid will certainly bring a fundamental change to the relationship between people and their bicycles.

Once you made up your mind about what to buy, you had a three-month wait because someone had to manufacture the bike or at least import it. You did not expect your purchase to be available for pick-up, let alone direct-to-door delivery, within twenty-four hours.</p><p>It was very much like buying a car. In the last twenty years, however, mainly due to the rise of e-commerce, most companies have developed systems that enable them to offer next-day delivery. The system worked fine as long as the gears in the production and supply chain functioned as a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Festka-Spectre-Porcelain-art-road-bike_hand-painted-full-custom-Bespoke-24k-gold-detailed-race-ready-carbon-road-bike_hand-made.jpg\" alt=\"Festka Spectre Porcelain art road bike, hand-painted full custom Bespoke 24k gold detailed race-ready carbon road bike\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Festka-Spectre-Porcelain-art-road-bike_hand-painted-full-custom-Bespoke-24k-gold-detailed-race-ready-carbon-road-bike_hand-made.jpg\"></p><p>“<em>Our advantage is that we are smaller and therefore more flexible.

However, due to delays in deliveries, it is no longer worthwhile to order the older standard with a lead time of fourteen months. In a year’s time, no one will want to buy an 11-speed groupset.

You can tell from the availability of products in their portfolio who produces where. Manufacturers based in Europe are doing much better than those that had moved their production to China, India and elsewhere in Asia,</em>” explains Moureček, adding that this may also be a new opportunity for European companies and manufacturers. “<em>There are still enough companies in Europe that produce some components for bicycles, cycling shoes, etc. They make great stuff but they cannot afford to invest as much money into marketing as the global giants do.

This is how smaller producers can benefit from the current stalemate,” estimates Moureček, but at the same time he adds: “<em>Unfortunately, the risk for them is that they may suffer the impact of a lack of raw materials as their production stands and falls with the availability of high-quality aluminium.</em>”</p><figure id=\"attachment_193189\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-193189\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01.jpg\" alt=\"Bikerumor Shimano Factory Tour provides an inside look at how Shimano cranks brakes and cassettes are made at their Sakai City Osaka Japan headquarters\" width=\"1200\" height=\"799\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-768x511.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-696x463.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-1068x711.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-631x420.jpg 631w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-768x511.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-600x400.jpg 600w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-696x463.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-1068x711.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shimano-factory-tour-machining-cnc-parts01-631x420.jpg 631w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-193189\">Shimano Factory, photo by Tyler Benedict</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Parallels with other affected industries</strong><br>There are only a handful of companies in the world that make chips. In the cycling industry, the all-important groupset manufacture is dominated by Japan’s Shimano and the US producer SRAM. If these companies are in trouble, the whole industry is in trouble and the bike market goes to pot. When the situation with these large manufacturers stabilises, they will surely prioritise the biggest bicycle manufacturers.

Small independent producers who survive this difficult period can profit from the current crisis. It would be a mistake to think that manufacturers can go it completely alone and show everybody. The companies that make up the cycling industry are interdependent, even if they do not wish to admit it. In this respect, the sector is perhaps a little different from the automotive industry where companies tend to own the producers of vital components such as lights for instance.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling a bittersweet winner of the coronavirus crisis an editorial by Michael Moureček, co-founder of Festka perspective\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb13 src ng ngcb13 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02130159/Festka-coronavirus-outlook-Michael-Mourecek_Workshop3-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a></p><p>That gives those businesses a greater opportunity to manage crises. “<em>In our industry, both small companies like us and the giants like Trek or Specialized are – to a great extent – in the same boat, because of our dependence on the big component manufacturers.
