This brings the number of Thread Group-certified products in the company’s portfolio to eight. Eve says it plans to render its entire product line Thread compatible over time, although that will require hardware changes to some existing products (in other words, existing owners will need to replace gear to gain the feature, versus simply updating firmware).</p><figure kioskedhash_production=\"11429_bb79fdfc719646c6388fdabbb67ecf61\" data-kiosked-context-name=\"kskdUIContext_01ezytpwjntcqxh6s7kzgazyza\"><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/eve_energy_na_lifestyle_02-100879483-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"<div class='credit'>Eve Systems</div>\n<p>The Eve Energy looks to be sufficiently compact that it won’t block an adjacent outlet.</p>\n\"><img alt=\"eve energy na lifestyle 02\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-imageid=\"100879483\" data-license=\"Supplied Art\" data-original=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/eve_energy_na_lifestyle_02-100879483-large.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/03/eve_energy_na_lifestyle_02-100879483-large.jpg\"></a><small>Eve Systems</small><figcaption><p>The Eve Energy looks to be sufficiently compact that it won’t block an adjacent outlet.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The Eve Energy smart plug will be available April 6 for $39.95.

Using a HomePod mini—as opposed to an Apple TV (fourth-gen or later), a HomePod, or a cast-off iPad—for this purpose delivers an added benefit in that it will function as a Thread border router.</p><p>The Thread router in the Eve Energy will route data traffic between nodes on the Thread network itself, but you’ll need a Thread <em>border</em> router to connect a Thread network to other IP-based networks, such as Wi-Fi or ethernet.</p><p>Eve stresses that its smart home products are not dependent on the cloud. If your broadband connection fails, Eve’s smart home products will continue to operate under local control. And to enhance privacy, all data is stored locally, with the Eve Core chipset capable of storing up to six months of data at a time.</p><div><p>Today's Best Tech Deals</p><p>Picked by TechHive's Editors</p></div><div><p>Top Deals On Great Products</p><p>Picked by Techconnect's Editors</p></div><p>We’ll have in-depth hands-on reviews of these new products as soon as we get them in house for testing.</p><div><p>Note: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.
