They decided to just build a whole frame, why not?&nbsp; Elliot pulled some inspiration from Don McClung with that double top tube and devilishy short wheelbase.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Paul levers, check. DT Swiss 240 hubs with HED belguim rims , which Elliot laced as well.&nbsp; Carbon 29er fork with V brakes, check. Moné MRB bars with a Thompson stem to cap it all off, what else? A buddy stitched the framebag for all those klunking essentials.&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; no bike would be complete without a spoke card from Monique.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" data-base-url=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg\" data-base-quality=\"75\" data-alt-srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\"></p><p>Elliot told me that they had “zero regrets about the geometry.” I took it for a quick spin and instantly understood how they held that wheelie for so long.&nbsp; This bike is dripping in DIY and that geometry is just egging you on to have some fun.&nbsp; Oh yeah, Elliot is in high school, like freshman in high school. I’ve said it once and Ill say it again, the kids are alright y’all.</p></div><nav><h4>Related</h4></nav></article></section></div>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ec91b3bf38e154c45c59994bf09aa36ecf535329effb6cd1914801e52b882f4c","category":"Cycling"}
