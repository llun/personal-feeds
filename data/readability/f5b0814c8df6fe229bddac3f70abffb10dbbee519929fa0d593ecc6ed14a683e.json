There were a total of 130 disengagements, up from 64 last year, but that's not a surprise considering the increase in milage. Apple's cars experienced a disengagement every 144.6 miles, which is a better metric than 2019 where there was a disengagement every 117.8 miles.</p><p>All companies that are testing self-driving vehicles in California are required to file annual disengagement reports providing details on how many times a vehicle disengages and gives control back to the safety driver, or the number of times a safety driver in the vehicle takes over.</p><p>Companies must also report total mileage covered by self-driving cars and provide details on any accidents when they occur, but Apple hasn't had a recent accident. The last collision an Apple vehicle experienced <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2020/05/Apple_091919.pdf\">was in 2019</a>.</p><p>Apple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017 using Lexus RX450h SUVs outfitted with a host of sensors and cameras as it works on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> hardware.
