However, </span>because road bike tyres generally all look so similar, it’s not always easy to spot the difference between a good tyre and a bad tyre.</p>\n<p>Also, upgrading your bike’s stock tyres to something better, whether that be in terms of greater volume, decreased rolling resistance, improved cornering grip or simply <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-prevent-punctures/\">increased puncture protection</a>, can transform your riding experience.</p>\n<p><span>The good news is this – compared to other bike parts, getting the best road bike tyres needn’t cost the earth. Every tyre on this list has an RRP of £70 or less per tyre, and can most often be found at a discount. That may not be cheap but, as a component that has a significant impact on how your bike rides, it’s a relatively <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-cheap-road-bike-upgrades-2/\">cheap upgrade for your road bike</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the choice of road bike tyres available on the market can be a little overwhelming. The devil really is in the detail, so we’ve put our team of expert testers to the task, logging thousands of kilometres to find the best road bike tyres available in 2021.</span></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Best road bike wheels</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\" target=\"_blank\">Best gravel bike tyres</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">Best gravel bike wheels</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\" target=\"_blank\">Best mountain bike tyres</a></li>\n</ul><hr /><h2>Road bike tyres: what you need to know</h2>\n<p><span>Before we start, here’s a quick primer on some of the technical jargon. There’s a lot to take in, so once you’ve read through all of the reviews, keep reading for our full buyer’s guide to road bike tyres.</span></p>\n<h3>Types of road bike tyre</h3>\n<p><span>There are three main types of road bike tyre on the market today: clincher, tubeless and tubular.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clincher tyres, which have an open casing that requires the use of an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a>, are the most common type on the market. These mount on to standard hooked wheel rims.</span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">Tubeless tyres</a> use a similar open casing construction as clincher tyres but, as the name implies, can be used without inner tubes on specially designed, tubeless-compatible rims. </span></p>\n<p><span>This buyer’s guide contains our favourite tyres, regardless of type, but head this way if you want a separate list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">best tubeless tyres</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tubular tyres use a tubular casing that is sewn shut around an inner tube. The tyre is then glued on to a tubular-specific rim, which doesn’t have sidewalls or bead hooks. Tubular tyres are popular with professional cyclists, but are rarely used by amateurs.</span></p>\n<h3>Tyre sizes</h3>\n<p><span>You’ll see numbers such as 700 x 25mm quoted many times below. This refers to the size of the tyre.</span></p>\n<p><span>700 tyres mount on to 700c rims, which is the most common size for road bikes. If you have a very small road bike or a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike</a>, you may have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b wheels</a>, with a smaller diameter, in which case you’d need a 650 tyre.</span></p>\n<p><span>For <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bikes</a>, it’s a bit more complicated because there are a number of different <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">wheel sizes</a>, though these days most MTBs use either 27.5in (i.e. 650b) or 29in wheels.</span></p>\n<p><span>The second number refers to the width of the tyre in millimetres once it’s inflated (though the width of the rim a tyre is mounted on also affects the inflated size, so this is more of a guide).</span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re looking at buying road bike tyres larger than 25mm, you’ll need to check that your frame and fork both have adequate clearance. </span></p>\n<p><span>Until recently, most road bikes only had clearance for 25mm tyres, so unless you’ve got a relatively new bike, it’s sadly not a given you’ll be able to upgrade to a 28mm tyre or larger. If your road bike is relatively new – and especially if it has disc brakes – then you’ll likely be able to fit a 28mm tyre or larger.</span></p>\n\n<h3>What is TPI?</h3>\n<p><span>TPI refers to ‘threads per inch’ and indicates how many individual threads of woven nylon or cotton cross through one square inch of a single ply of the tyre’s casing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Lower TPI casings use fewer, thicker threads, whereas higher TPI casings use a greater number of thinner threads.</span></p>\n<p><span>Generally, higher TPI tyre casings offer a more supple, comfortable ride feel and deliver lower rolling resistance.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s no such thing as a free lunch though, because these tyres are usually more delicate and prone to punctures than tyres with lower TPI casings.</span></p>\n<p><span>Casing construction is also only one part of the equation in determining the overall rolling resistance of a tyre.</span></p>\n<h3>What is rolling resistance?</h3>\n<p><span>Rolling resistance, sometimes referred to as ‘Crr’ (coefficient of rolling resistance), is the energy lost as a tyre rolls across a surface.</span></p>\n<p><span>On hard surfaces, such as roads, losses can mainly be attributed to deformation of the tyre (hysteresis) and friction between the road surface and the tyre tread.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are a number of factors that determine a tyre’s rolling resistance, including construction, the rubber compound used for the tread, inflation pressure, the width of the tyre and the tread.</span></p>\n<p><span>We’ll take a deeper dive into this subject in the buyer’s guide at the end of the article because it’s quite a complicated subject. </span></p>\n<p><span>Generally though, for road use, you want a slick tyre (or a tyre with minimal tread) with a flexible casing, inflated to a high (but not too high) pressure.</span></p>\n<hr /><section><div>\n        <h2>The best road bike tyres in 2021, as rated by our team of expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Goodyear Eagle F1 Tubeless:</strong> £50</li>\n<li><strong>Schwalbe Pro One TLE:</strong> £69</li>\n<li><strong>WTB Exposure:</strong> £49.99</li>\n<li><strong>Bontrager R3 Hard-Case Lite TLR:</strong> £50</li>\n<li><strong>Continental Grand Prix 5000 Clincher:</strong> £60</li>\n<li><strong>Continental Grand Prix 5000 TL:</strong> £70</li>\n<li><strong>Hutchinson Fusion 5 Performance:</strong> £40</li>\n<li><strong>Michelin Power Road Clincher:</strong> £43</li>\n<li><strong>Pirelli P Zero Race TLR:</strong> £60</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized S-Works Turbo Cotton:</strong> £61</li>\n<li><strong>Cadex Race:</strong> £65</li>\n<li><strong>Hutchinson Fusion 5 Performance 11Storm TLR:</strong> £41</li>\n<li><strong>Maxxis High Road HYPR K2:</strong> £55</li>\n<li><strong>Vittoria Corsa TLR G2.0: </strong>£70</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Goodyear Eagle F1 Tubeless</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Inside the tyre is a 120 TPI casing with the company’s own R:Amor puncture-resistant belt.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price: </strong>£50 / US$75 / AU$97/ €60</li>\n<li><strong>Type: </strong>Tubeless (tested) or clincher</li>\n<li><strong>Colour options:</strong> Black or tan (black only for the tubeless variant)</li>\n<li><strong>Size and width options: </strong>700 x 25mm, 700 x 28mm, 700 x 30mm and 700 x 32mm</li>\n<li><strong>Size tested:</strong> 700 x 28mm</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 310g</li>\n<li><strong>TPI:</strong> 120</li>\n<li><strong>Verdict</strong>: Great grip in wet and dry conditions, with road-smoothing comfort</li>\n</ul><p><span>We love the Eagle F1’s wet and dry grip and speed, courtesy of its advanced, graphene- and silica-containing compound.

Unfortunately, that tyre doesn’t exist and so you generally have to make do with two of these three attributes.</p>\n<p>Your predominant type of riding should ultimately dictate your tyre choice. For example, if most of your time is spent heading out on gravel backroads or commuting on rough inner-city roads, you’ll be better off with a tyre that’s geared towards puncture protection over speed and weight.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you often ride on good roads that are smooth, debris-free and dry, then some lightweight, racy tyres can be a great choice.</p>\n<p>You can find out where most tyres sit in the weight / puncture protection / rolling resistance triangle by checking their packaging or the manufacturer’s website. And, of course, our reviews will let you know how those claims stack up in the real world.</p>\n<h3>Types of tyre</h3>\n<p>Tyres for road bikes come in three styles: clincher, tubeless and tubular.</p>\n<h4>Clincher tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Your road bike is probably rolling on clincher tyres because it’s by far the most common type of tyre these days.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized / @Billy_lebelge</i></span></div>\n<p>Clinchers are the most common type of tyres found on road bikes. They have an open casing that houses a separate inner tube and is held on the wheel by the rim bead hooks.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of clinchers is that they make fixing a flat easy because all you have to do to get at the punctured tube is pry off one side of the tyre. This usually requires a tyre lever or two, but with some tyres you can do it with just your thumbs.</p>\n<p>There are two types of clinchers: folding and non-folding. The difference is in the material used to make the bead (the part that hooks onto the rim).</p>\n<p>Folding clinchers generally use Kevlar, a durable material that – as the name suggests – allows the tyres to be folded. Non-folding clinchers use a bead made from steel wire bead and can’t be folded.</p>\n<p>Folding clinchers are more expensive but they’re also lighter and are easier to get on and off a rim. The fact that they fold isn’t really important as far as riding is concerned, but it does usually mean such tyres have slightly lower levels of rolling resistance.</p>\n<h4>Tubeless tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This diagram from Schwalbe shows a cross-section of its Pro One Tubeless Easy tyre, on a hooked tubeless-ready rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Schwalbe</i></span></div>\n<p>Tubeless tyres have been a mainstay in the mountain biking world for some time and they’ve now come to road cycling.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, tubeless tyres don’t use an inner tube. They’re very similar to standard clinchers except that the tyre and rim seal together to become airtight and remain inflated, just like the tyres on most modern cars.</p>\n<p>Such an airtight seal can’t be achieved with any old rim and tyre though, A tubeless setup not only requires tubeless-specific tyres (which have a special stretch-resistant tyre bead) and rims but also a special valve, viscous liquid sealant and special rim tape.</p>\n<p>The idea is that removing the inner tube from the equation reduces weight and rolling resistance, and, without said inner tube, you can also run lower tyre pressures without the fear of a pinch flat, meaning a more comfortable ride and more grip.</p>\n<p>The addition of the sealant can help eliminate punctures from small, sharp objects. This is particularly welcome on tyres designed for going off-road and delicate racing tyres such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-pro-one-tubeless-tyre-released/\">Schwalbe Pro One TT</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/vittoria-corsa-speed-tire-review/\">Vittoria Corsa Speed</a>, which use thin casings and eschew puncture protection strips in order to reduce rolling resistance to the absolute minimum.</p>\n<p>If the puncture hole can’t be sealed by sealant alone (because it’s too large, for example), you still have the option of fitting an inner tube, or there are ‘tyre worm’ repair kits such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/puncture-repair-kit/stans-notubes-dart-tubeless-repair-kit-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Stan’s NoTubes DART</a>.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\" target=\"_blank\">Best tubeless sealant</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubeless tyres use sealant to seal-up small cuts before they become punctures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>Tubeless tyres aren’t a panacea, however. In order to aid air retention, manufacturers sometimes have to make the tyre casing thicker and heavier than on a standard clincher tyre, which can dull ride feel and increase rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>They can also be far more difficult to install if you get a rim and tyre combination that doesn’t play nice, and you may also need an air compressor or special ‘flash’ pump to properly seat the tyre bead.</p>\n<p>Much of the bike industry, and particularly wheel and tyre manufacturers, are convinced tubeless is the future for road cycling, though. In fact, it’s quite unusual to see a new tyre or wheelset without tubeless compatibility these days.</p>\n<p>Some brands are even beginning to release <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\" target=\"_blank\">hookless rims for road use</a>, on which the bead hooks have been eliminated. This means compatibility is limited to tubeless tyres only because standard clincher tyres (which have much stretchier tyre beads) require the bead hooks to prevent them from blowing off the rim when inflated.</p>\n<h4>Tubular tyres</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tubular tyres see the inner tube sewn directly into the tyre, which is then glued on to a tubular rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubeless-tyres-pro-peloton/\">the rise of road tubeless technology</a>, tubulars are still what most pro riders use for racing.</p>\n<p>They still rely on an inner tube but instead of the casing being open, like on a clincher, it’s sewn shut around the inner tube, so that the pairing takes on a tubular form — hence the name. The tyre then has to be glued (or taped using special double-sided tape) onto a rim specifically made for tubular tyres.</p>\n<p>Unlike rims designed for clinchers, tubular rims don’t have bead hooks inside the sidewalls for a tyre to clinch onto. Tubulars rely on tyre pressure and glue to hold them on the rim.</p>\n<p>Some riders still swear by tubular tyres, claiming they offer a superior ‘feel’. This can largely be attributed to the fact that until recent years, many tyre manufacturers only released their fastest tyres in tubular form.</p>\n<p>Tubular tyres also tend to have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubs-vs-clinchers-which-are-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">slightly higher rolling resistance</a> than an equivalent clincher because of frictional losses in the glue.</p>\n<p>But the big, tangible advantage to tubular systems for road use is that the equivalent tubular rims can be made much lighter than a clincher or tubeless-ready rim. This makes them extremely popular with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/weight-weenie-heres-why-its-not-your-fault/\">weight weenies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hill-climb-tech-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\">hill climb obsessives</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Having a pro mechanic to glue your tyres on to your rims makes using tubular systems much easier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A second, more esoteric advantage is that tubular tyres can still be ridden when punctured. This is because they won’t separate from the rim, unlike clinchers, meaning a rider can continue riding until the punctured wheel can be changed – vital in pro races such as Paris-Roubaix where punctures are historically very common.</p>\n<p>Tubulars are also said to be more resistant to ‘pinch flats’, where the inner tube is pinched between the rim and tyre, usually caused by hitting a sharp-edged obstacle such as a pothole. This is probably more a function of the tendency to run tubulars at higher pressures than their construction, though.</p>\n<p>The disadvantages of tubulars – which tend to be felt much more keenly by regular cyclists than the pros with team mechanics – are that having to glue tyres to the rim makes the initial installation laborious (although tubular tape arguably eases this issue) and sorting a puncture during a ride can be very difficult.</p>\n<p>Your two options are using a CO2 inflator cartridge containing sealant, and hoping it can seal the hole, or tearing off the punctured tubular and replacing it with another, which obviously means riding with a spare. (Actually repairing a punctured tubular, rather than simply replacing it, means breaking out the sewing kit.)</p>\n<p>You can – very carefully – ride home on a spare tubular stretched over a rim, but you must glue this new tubular in place before your next ride.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-glue-a-tubular-tyre/\">Glueing a tubular is no piece of cake either</a>. It requires attention to detail and plenty of patience because a bad job can result in the tyre rolling off the rim, likely causing a dangerous crash.</p>\n<h2>Rolling resistance continued…</h2>\n<p><span>As already noted at the beginning of this article, there are a lot of factors that determine the rolling resistance of a tyre. Let’s explore those in more detail.</span></p>\n<h3>Tyre construction</h3>\n<p><span>Tyres with thinner treads and higher TPI casings tend to be more supple, and thus require less energy to deform. This in turn means less energy is lost to hysteresis, which decreases rolling resistance.</span></p>\n<p><span>The exact recipe of the rubber compound used in the tyre’s tread makes a large difference too. Additives such as silica or graphene are used to reduce losses to friction and hysteresis, but each manufacturer guards its own exact recipe very carefully.</span></p>\n<p><span>Increasing the thickness of the rubber tread or adding puncture protection strips or layers can also affect rolling resistance by increasing the amount of energy required to deform the tyre.</span></p>\n<p><span>The fastest tyres combine supple casings, thin treads and low friction rubber compounds. The downsides to these tyres though are usually significantly decreased puncture protection and service life.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyres with a lightweight casing will often roll faster, but that may come at the cost of durability and puncture protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Tyres that use thicker treads on stiffer casings will be slower, but you’ll generally also get better puncture protection and service life. </span></p>\n<p><span>For this reason, many riders will switch to tyres such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-gatorskin-road-tyre-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Continental Gatorskin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/schwalbe-durano-road-tire-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe Durano</a> during the winter, when the increased rolling resistance is less of a concern than the prospect of having to fix punctures with cold hands.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s a well worn cliché, but it’s also true that nothing is slower than a puncture. Time trial tyres are unlikely to be the best choice for training, long distance sportives or commuting. Choose tyres that have the right balance of characteristics for your personal riding needs.</span></p>\n<h3>Tyre width</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road bike tyres are getting wider.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The main thing you need to know is that, for most people, wider tyres are generally faster and more comfortable.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is because, at the same pressure, wider tyres have a shorter contact patch with the road than narrow tyres and this decreases the deformation of the tyre, which decreases rolling resistance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, in the real world, we tend to run wider tyres at lower pressures than narrow ones, which can cancel out that rolling resistance advantage, but you also get increased comfort and grip with the wider tyre, which makes a big difference to how fast you can ride on imperfect roads.</span></p>\n<p><span>The only downsides are that wider tyres increase weight and aerodynamic drag slightly, meaning they require a little more energy to accelerate and push through the air. The benefits of wider tyres outweigh these marginal losses at the speeds most of us ride at, though.</span></p>\n<p><span>The tables only really turn at the higher speeds seen in time trials or on the track (because the faster you ride, the more aerodynamics matter), but with modern wheels now designed around 25mm or wider tyres, there’s very little reason to choose 23mm or narrower tyres anymore.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s little reason to run narrow 23mm tyres anymore.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Tyre pressure</h3>\n<p>On a perfectly smooth surface, like rollers or an indoor track, higher pressures mean less tyre deformation and therefore lower rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>As most people know all too well, in the real world the roads are we actually ride on are not perfectly smooth. In fact, if you were to look very closely, even the smoothest road is actually full of small holes, bumps and imperfections.</p>\n<p>Because of this, tyres run at too high pressures have a tendency to bounce over the road surface. This may feel fast, but it’s actually slowing you down because the energy you’re putting through the pedals isn’t contributing to driving the bike forward when the tyre isn’t in contact with the ground.</p>\n<p>Lowering your tyre pressure enables the tyre to act as a kind of suspension system, keeping your rubber in contact with the road more of the time and wasting less of your energy input.</p>\n<p>The key to tyre pressure is finding the right balance between having it high enough to minimise tyre deformation but low enough to absorb the vibrations and keep the rubber in contact with the surface you’re riding on.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s no hard and fast rule for what pressure this will be for you because, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/trail-tech-mountain-bike-tyre-pressure-all-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">just like with mountain biking</a>, it depends on myriad factors such as what kinds of terrain you ride on, what wheels and tyres you’re using and how much you weigh.</p>\n<p>The best advice we can offer is to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations, experiment with different pressures and err on the side of being slightly too low instead of slightly too high. That way you’ll at least be more comfortable and have more grip.</p>\n<h3>Inner tubes and tubeless</h3>\n<p><span>The inner tubes in a clincher or tubular system are also the source of some frictional and hysteresis losses.</span></p>\n<p><span>Thinner, lighter inner tubes generally contribute less to rolling resistance because there is less material to deform, meaning they’re more flexible.</span></p>\n<p><span>Latex inner tubes, though more expensive than standard butyl inner tubes, offer even less rolling resistance because latex is more supple than butyl and requires less energy to deform.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even the type of inner tube you use will have a small but measurable effect on rolling resistance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Tubeless systems offer reduced rolling resistance by eliminating the inner tube altogether. However, it’s not as simple as saying ‘tubeless is therefore faster’ because tubeless tyres often have more material added to the tyre itself to make it airtight, which can increase the rolling resistance of the tyre compared to an equivalent clincher.</span></p>\n<p><span>The amount of sealant added to a tubeless tyre system has also been shown to affect rolling resistance (adding more sealant than you need increases rolling resistance), so we’d always recommend following the manufacturer’s instructions.</span></p>\n<h2>Anatomy of a tyre</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is a side cut of a Continental Grand Prix 4 Seasons tyre, the red cross-hatching is added sidewall reinforcement to protect against punctures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Courtesy</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Bead:</strong> This is what holds clincher and tubeless tyres on the wheel rim. The air pressure inside the tyre pushes the beads out, making them hook onto the rim. Wheels with hookless rims require the use of tyres with a tubeless-specific bead because standard clincher tyre beads may stretch off the rim when inflated, leading to a potentially dangerous blowout.</li>\n<li><strong>Casing:</strong> This is cloth fabric ‘woven’ around the beads that creates the main body of the tyre. While the vast majority use nylon fabric, higher-end tyres may use cotton or silk. The casing has a major effect on ride quality because of the threads per inch (TPI) value. Tyres with a low TPI will have thicker threads, which cause greater rolling resistance but make the tyre more resistant to punctures. Meanwhile, tyres with a high TPI use finer threads for less rolling resistance and lower weight, but will be more susceptible to punctures.</li>\n<li><strong>Sidewall:</strong> Rubber is applied to the side of the casing between the tread and the bead to form the sidewall. Each tyre will have different rubber compounds and thickness depending on its intended purpose.</li>\n<li><strong>Sub-tread:</strong> Some tyres will have a sub-tread layer to fend off punctures. Cheaper tyres may just have an additional layer of rubber beneath the tread, while those at the higher end of the price range will have specially designed fabric strips. These have an unfortunate side effect of increasing rolling resistance, so are often left out of tyres designed specifically for time trials.</li>\n<li><strong>Tread:</strong> This is the rubber that comes into contact with the road. It’s thicker than the sidewall and sometimes features a three-dimensional pattern. Tread pattern is a hotly debated issue, with many claiming that road bike tyres have no need for tread. However, according to Finnish outfit Wheel Energy, because the texture of any road surface is so varied, some tread patterns provide a measurable mechanical adhesion to the ground. Recent testing even shows that tread pattern can affect the aerodynamic performance of tyres too. The rubber compounds used for different tyres are a closely guarded secret. Generally, softer compounds will offer superior traction but will wear quickly, while harder compounds will stand up to more abuse but won’t have the same grip.</li>\n</ul><h2>How often should you replace your tyres?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some tyres have wear indicators, which will disappear over the life of the tyre. Once they go, it’s time to replace the tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s no hard and fast rule for deciding when to replace a tyre. Some have wear indicators – usually a dot or groove in the tread that will wear away over the life of the tyre. In most cases, these indicators offer a pretty good sign of how much life remains in your tyres, but they’re not perfect.</p>\n<p>For tyres that don’t have these markers, keep an eye out for gashes and cuts in the tread and sidewalls, ‘squared off’ tread or a flat section in the middle of the tyre, or any odd lumps or bulging. If cuts and gashes are so deep that you can see the casing fabric underneath, or you’re repeatedly suffering flats, it’s time for a new tyre.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"259432736050fd4db7d904bfda9f5bf65bc095026345631dff4638cceff30eaa","category":"Cycling"}
