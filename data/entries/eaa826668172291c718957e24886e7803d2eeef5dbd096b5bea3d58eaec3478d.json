I got the first bike that I could travel distances on when I was 14. Granted it was a beach cruiser but hey, we lived at the beach. I&#8217;d carry my skateboard and even a surfboard to spots after school and on the weekends. It was a vessel of adolescent liberation.</p>\n<p>For Jonah, a local of Santa Fe, and an employee at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mellowvelobikes/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mellow Velo</a>, the bicycle has helped develop his independence as well as a vehicle to meander around his homeland. His family is one of the deeply embedded heritage households and have been in the area for hundreds of years. Just north of Santa Fe is the town of Chimayo where his family has been weaving for generations under the brand <a href=\"http://www.ortegasweaving.com/acc.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ortega</a>.<span id=\"more-204529\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Santa Fe is full of this kind of heritage.

Well, working at Mellow Velo, he was presented the opportunity to buy the frame second hand and since he lives at home still, he was able to spend his paycheck on parts and bags. Not a bad gig for a twenty-something. He&#8217;s been whetting his ax with bikepacking in recent months and this is the perfect bike for the Santa Fe area, with its endless access to trails all around town.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204569\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Jonah-and-His-Kokopelli-Ti-Hardtail-29er-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>This is a <a href=\"https://www.kokopellibikes.com/warthog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kokopelli Warthog</a>, their 29+ hardtail model, complete with a chainstay yoke, plenty of clearance, and slider dropouts.
