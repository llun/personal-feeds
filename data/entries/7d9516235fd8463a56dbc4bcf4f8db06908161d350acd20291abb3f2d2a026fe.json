The music of The Specials documents the city’s post-industrial travails (and that of Thatcherite Britain) but it’s a place enjoying something of a renaissance lately. I do most of my cycling to the south of the city on the country lanes and bridleways of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s home patch).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/image1-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This is a Brother Cycles’ Kepler with its original 90s-inspired paint scheme. The latest iteration of the frame is built for 160 mm rotors, this earlier one takes 622 mm. It’s a comfy ride that has a spring in its step (but is the planing in my head?) and the Albatross bars help no end on the comfort front too. They’re wrapped in cotton tape and finished with twine and shellac. I think I just about pulled off the layering: the tape matches the saddle, the twine pairing with the bell (and the gate). Finding a matching purple Cyclists’ Touring Club sticker was also a bonus.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/image2-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Component-wise, silver was the brief. It’s a mishmash of Velo Orange, Nitto, SunXCD, Shimano, and Campagnolo. The latter comes from a stash of alloy 10 speed I snaffled in the mid-00s when they moved towards being predominantly plastic (yes, I’m a fan of The Retrogrouch’s postings). Living in the west of England, mudguards with flaps are a must (don’t be deceived by the blue sky in the photos, there’s a reason for the greenery). The cork securing the front one to the rack is from a bottle of Rioja. Having a Spanish wife, this was non-negotiable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/image6-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Frame: Brother Cycles Kepler ‘Flash’<br />\nWheels: hand built by Harry Rowland, Shimano LX hubs with Mavic rims<br />\nTyres: Panaracer Gravel King SK TLC (700 x 35)<br />\nChainset: Campagnolo Chorus triple (53/42/30)<br />\nFront derailleur: Campagnolo Record triple<br />\nRear derailleur: SunXCD long cage<br />\nCassette: Shimano 9 speed (11-34)<br />\nShifters: Rivendell<br />\nBrake levers: Velo Orange Grand Cru regular pull<br />\nBrakes: Velo Orange Grand Cru Zeste<br />\nHandlebars: Nitto Albatross (with Newbaum tape and twine)<br />\nStem: Holdsworth<br />\nSaddle: Brooks C17<br />\nSeat post: Nitto S92<br />\nSeat collar: Soma<br />\nHeadset: Velo Orange Grand Cru<br />\nMudguards: Velo Orange Hammered 45 mm (leather flaps and Grand Cru reflector)<br />\nPedals: Shimano PD-A600<br />\nRack: Velo Orange Randonneur<br />\nBag: Velo Orange / Road Runner Randonneur<br />\nBottle Cages: Velo Orange Retro<br />\nBottles: Sim Works<br />\nPump and pegs: no brand chrome things off eBay<br />\nBell: Crane E-NE<br />\nWine bottle cork: Cune</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/image0-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
