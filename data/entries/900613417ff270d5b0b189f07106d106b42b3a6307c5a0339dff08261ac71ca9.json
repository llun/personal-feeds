Those include terrorism, threats of violence, membership in hate groups, and sexual offenses, as listed by the policy.</p>\n<p>Twitch says it will engage \"a highly-regarded third-party investigative partner\" to investigate such claims of off-Twitch conduct and act in cases where evidence is available and can be verified, such as through links, screenshots, or video that has been \"confirmed by our third party investigator as authentic.\" If that law firm finds a \"preponderance of evidence,\" then the situation will be forwarded to a law enforcement response team to \"manage sensitive, confidential investigations and partner with law enforcement.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755393#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755393&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"900613417ff270d5b0b189f07106d106b42b3a6307c5a0339dff08261ac71ca9","category":"Tech"}
