Company officials wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We have heard concerns about the nature of this vulnerability and are sharing technical details to address these questions. We have determined that the unauthenticated factory reset vulnerability was introduced to the My Book Live in April of 2011 as part of a refactor of authentication logic in the device firmware. The refactor centralized the authentication logic into a single file, which is present on the device as <code>includes/component_config.php</code> and contains the authentication type required by each endpoint. In this refactor, the authentication logic in <code>system_factory_restore.php</code> was correctly disabled, but the appropriate authentication type of <code>ADMIN_AUTH_LAN_ALL</code> was not added to <code>component_config.php</code>, resulting in the vulnerability. The same refactor removed authentication logic from other files and correctly added the appropriate authentication type to the <code>component_config.php</code> file.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post added:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776939#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776939&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f8afd1e7b4539bbe18edf2d61239792a32313101c4db458df20f9d3ae8246a4","category":"Tech"}
