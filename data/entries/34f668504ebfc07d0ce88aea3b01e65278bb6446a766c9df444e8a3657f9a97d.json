Each third of the documentary will launch on the streaming service on November 25, 26, and 27. As of press time, Disney hasn't said how the film will reach audiences outside of Disney+'s supported territories. Neither Jackson nor Disney clarified how the original theatrical run might have worked or whether the global pandemic forced anyone's hand.</p>\n<p>Today's news confirms that Jackson had an abundance of footage to work with. Roughly three years ago, the remaining Beatles handed him access to a musical holy grail: over 60 hours of previously unseen video recordings, mostly capturing the Beatles working on the album <em>Let It Be</em> and rehearsing for, and then performing, the band's legendary 1969 rooftop concert in London.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774274#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774274&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34f668504ebfc07d0ce88aea3b01e65278bb6446a766c9df444e8a3657f9a97d","category":"Tech"}
