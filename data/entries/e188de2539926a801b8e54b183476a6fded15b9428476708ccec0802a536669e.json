{"title":"‘Apple Robbed the Mob’s Bank’","link":"https://mobiledevmemo.com/apple-robbed-the-mobs-bank/","date":1620755712000,"content":"\n<p>Eric Benjamin Seufert, writing at Mobile Dev Memo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last week, Apple introduced a new ad unit to the App Store: a paid placement on its Search page. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5527ddd1-77a8-4cd0-82fd-4568be5da80f\">Rumors of this new unit had circulated previously</a>, although the notion that Apple would increase the density of ad placements in the App Store was wholly predictable, as I assert in <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/why-is-apple-rebuilding-the-app-economy/\">this piece</a> and <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/why-is-apple-building-an-ad-network/\">this piece</a>. Apple is expanding its mobile advertising platform in parallel with the rollout of the <a href=\"https://mobiledevmemo.com/app-tracking-transparency-codex-guide-to-idfa-deprecation-and-skadnetwork/\">App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy</a>, which presents meaningful commercial challenges to other mobile ad platforms and will likely diminish their operational efficiency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess this money is too good to pass up. But Apple pushing further into mobile advertising <em>now</em> — right after launching this App Tracking Transparency feature — just looks cheesy. It’s ham-fisted. Why not let the paint dry on ATT before adding new ad units to the App Store?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/11/seufert-apple-facebook\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e188de2539926a801b8e54b183476a6fded15b9428476708ccec0802a536669e","category":"Tech"}
