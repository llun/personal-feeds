In other cases, the fungus can also attack the lungs, breaks in the skin, and the gastrointestinal system or spread throughout the body in the blood stream.</p>\n<p>A classic feature of mucormycosis is tissue necrosis—the death of flesh, essentially—which in the rhinocerebral form of the disease can lead to black, discolored lesions on the face, particularly on the bridge of the nose and the roof of the mouth. Mucormycosis is fatal in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/mucormycosis/statistics.html\">around 50 percent</a> of cases.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764334#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764334&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2c85d1776ae6f01f8801432fe16fcfffd1e109e0eb2d93265ef34ebcabbdc908","category":"Tech"}
