Coming into his 25th year of business, the Geelong-based builder is world-renowned for his arguably flawless steel and titanium machines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days Baum Cycles consists of a team of makers that work within a large (by custom bike standards) manufacturing facility. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr1zJjXIZxg\" target=\"_blank\">We’ve taken a tour of the facility before</a> and it remains the pinnacle building space amongst Australian framemakers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short video above Baum talks through his personal Orbis + all-road machine. You can also see this bike in our <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gallery-the-best-of-the-2021-handmade-bicycle-show-australia-part-three/\" target=\"_blank\">third gallery from the Handmade Bicycle Show Australia</a>.
