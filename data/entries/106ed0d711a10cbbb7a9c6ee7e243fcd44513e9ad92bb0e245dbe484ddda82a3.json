Her life revolves around acting as interpreter for her parents and working on the family's struggling fishing boat every day before school with her father and older brother. But when Ruby joins her high school's choir club, she discovers a gift for singing and finds herself drawn to her duet partner Miles. Encouraged by her enthusiastic, tough-love choirmaster to apply to a prestigious music school, Ruby finds herself torn between the obligations she feels to her family and the pursuit of her own dreams.</blockquote>\"CODA\" is written and directed by Siân Heder, who directed and wrote one episode of the ‌‌Apple TV+‌‌ series \"Little America\" called \"The Silence.\"  CODA was presented in the U.S. Dramatic Competition category at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, and in total won four awards at Sundance. The film premieres on ‌Apple TV+‌ and in select theaters later this year on August 13.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, Apple today greenlit \"Liaison\" as its first French-language original series, according to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/apple-orders-first-french-language-original-series-liaison-1234973151\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/liaison-first-look.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLiaison will be a high-stakes contemporary thriller starring Vincent Cassel and Eva Green, featuring a mix of English and French dialogue.
