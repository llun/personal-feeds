She is the first openly\ntransgender federal official to win Senate confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>The final vote Wednesday was 52-48. Republican Sens. Lisa\nMurkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine joined all\nDemocrats in supporting Levine.</p>\n\n<p>Levine had been serving as Pennsylvania’s top health official\nsince 2017, and emerged as the public face of the state’s response\nto the coronavirus pandemic. She is expected to oversee Health and\nHuman Services offices and programs across the U.S.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It takes courage and a thick skin to be a trailblazer like Levine. She’s more than qualified for this position — the votes against her are as shameful as they are transparent. I’m so proud that she’s from Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/03/31/a-proclamation-on-transgender-day-of-visibility-2021/\">President Biden, today</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, we honor and celebrate the achievements and resiliency of\ntransgender individuals and communities. Transgender Day of\nVisibility recognizes the generations of struggle, activism, and\ncourage that have brought our country closer to full equality for\ntransgender and gender non-binary people in the United States and\naround the world. Their trailblazing work has given countless\ntransgender individuals the bravery to live openly and\nauthentically. This hard-fought progress is also shaping an\nincreasingly accepting world in which peers at school, teammates\nand coaches on the playing field, colleagues at work, and allies\nin every corner of society are standing in support and solidarity\nwith the transgender community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Living openly and authentically shouldn’t require bravery. Today it does; someday, it won’t.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/31/rachel-levine\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"84ed4ad16ac441a7da739f4e9483dcf25c8d5c8cac2249c2def09dbbeefb8f90","category":"Tech"}
