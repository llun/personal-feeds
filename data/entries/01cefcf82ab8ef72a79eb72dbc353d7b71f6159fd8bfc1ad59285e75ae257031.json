Material choice can also affect grip when riding in the wet, and durability too.</p>\n<p>Beyond comfort and control, swapping out old bar tape for new is an affordable way to customise a bike or give it a new lease of life. In fact, as far as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-cheap-road-bike-upgrades-2/\">cheap road bike upgrades</a> go, a roll of new tape is one of the easiest ways to freshen up your ride.</p>\n<p>Here is our selection of the best handlebar tapes and a few pointers on what to look out for. Once you’ve chosen your new look, read our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-wrap-bar-tape/\">how to wrap handlebar tape</a>.</p>\n<h2>Buyer’s guide to handlebar tape | What to look for</h2>\n<p>Bar tape was traditionally made from cork or leather. Cork offers good absorption and remains grippy in wet weather while leather bar tape provides great comfort and has a classic appearance.</p>\n<p>These materials are still used, but today bar tape is more frequently made from synthetic materials such as polyurethane, silicone and rubberised polymers.</p>\n<p>Man-made materials provide several benefits as they are lightweight and durable and can be particularly grippy with ‘sticky’ surfaces and imprinted grips.</p>\n<p>Often, synthetic materials are used as an outer and paired with a gel or foam inner. This can drastically alter the feel of a bike with non-backed tapes being as thin as 1.5mm and backed tapes being as thick as 5mm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> New handlebar tape is a sure-fire way to give your bike a new lease of life.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Thickness and backing of bar tape often come down to personal preference. Maybe you are riding on gravel and want as much vibration to be absorbed as possible, or you ride with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-summer-cycling-gloves/\">cycling gloves</a> so prefer a thinner bar tape.</p>\n<p>In some cases, bar tape comes backed with adhesive strips. This can make wrapping or removing bar tape a tricky affair, but it does hold the tape in place.</p>\n<p>When it comes to wrapping, some synthetic bar tapes are high-stretch, making it easier to wrap the tape around brake levers and hoods.</p>\n<p>The length of bar tape can also impact wrapping. If you are wrapping particularly wide bars, say on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bike</a>, then you will have less material to play with.</p>\n<p>The final point to consider is looks. Cork or leather tape will give any build a retro flavour, while thicker tape might look out of place on a classy <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-road-bikes/\">steel bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Bar tape also comes in a range of colours and patterns and can give any build a personal touch, but one thing many cyclists will insist on is bar tape matching the colour of the bike’s saddle.</p>\n<p>Of course, colour choice is personal preference, but deviation may provoke angry comments from those who adhere to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bikeradar-podcast-ep-6-is-it-time-to-ditch-the-rules/\">The Rules</a>.</p>\n<h2>PRO Sport Comfort</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> PRO’s Sport Comfort comes highly recommended by us.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Thickness: </strong>3.5mm</li>\n<li><strong>Plug type:</strong> Press in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £18 / $24 / AU$33</li>\n</ul><p>PRO’s Sport Comfort is the thickest tape here at 3.5mm, thanks to its extra layer of gel padding.</p>\n<p>The wide, non-sticky silicone adhesive strip actually sticks to the bar effectively and is very easy to remove without residue.
