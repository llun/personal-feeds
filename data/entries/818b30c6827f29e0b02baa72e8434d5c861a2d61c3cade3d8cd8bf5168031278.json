Essentially, this makes a Mach.2 \"two drives in one chassis.\" (credit: <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/innovation/multi-actuator-hard-drives/\">Seagate</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Seagate has been working on dual-actuator hard drives—drives with two arms and read/write heads per platter—for several years. Its first production dual-actuator drive, the Mach.2, is now \"available to select customers,\" meaning that enterprises can buy it directly from Seagate, but end-users are out of luck for now.</p>\n<p>Seagate lists the sustained, sequential transfer rate of the Mach.2 as up to 524MBps—easily double that of a fast \"normal\" rust disk and edging into SATA SSD territory. The performance gains extend into random I/O territory as well, with 304 IOPS read / 384 IOPS write and only 4.16 ms average latency. (Normal hard drives tend to be 100/150 IOPS and about the same average latency.)</p>\n<p>The added performance requires additional power; Mach.2 drives are rated for 7.2 W idle, while Seagate's standard Ironwolf line is rated at 5 W idle. It gets more difficult to compare loaded power consumption because Seagate specs the Mach.2 differently than the Ironwolf. The Mach.2's power consumption is explicitly <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/innovation/multi-actuator-hard-drives/\">rated</a> for several random I/O scenarios, while the Ironwolf line is rated for an unhelpful \"average operating power,\" which isn't defined in the <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/www-content/datasheets/pdfs/ironwolf-12tbDS1904-9-1707US-en_US.pdf\">data sheet</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766760#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766760&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"818b30c6827f29e0b02baa72e8434d5c861a2d61c3cade3d8cd8bf5168031278","category":"Tech"}
