The icon also has an embossed look that makes it stand out from other Apple icons.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for Artists is an app that lets artists know how their music is performing across &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, iTunes, and Shazam, so it's an app with a limited audience and the new icon may seem inconsequential, but it is similar to another app icon change that Apple introduced last year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> Connect in October <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/07/app-store-connect-fresh-icon/\">was updated with a refreshed icon</a> that's similar to the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for Artists icon, which means Apple has now updated two app icons with this new design.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/appstoreconnect.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"937\" height=\"460\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-762941\" /><em><div class=\"center-wrap\">&zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect with old icon on left, new icon on right</div></em>\r\n<br/>\r\nOver <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/mlitcj/apple_just_updated_app_store_connect_apple_music/\">on Reddit</a>, users are speculating that the icon changes could perhaps be indicative of more sweeping design changes set to be introduced in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> refreshed many of its icons and streamlined their design, so there is a chance that something similar could happen in &zwnj;iOS 15&zwnj;. That said, these could just be one-off updates for Apple's behind the scenes apps for developers and musicians, and not a sign of something to come.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe don't know much at all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">about iOS 15</a> at this point, but we could perhaps see some details leaking out as the software's launch date approaches. Apple is expected to debut &zwnj;iOS 15&zwnj;, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS 12</a> at its keynote event that will be held on June 7.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/apple-music-for-artists-revamped-icon/\">Apple&#039;s Revamped Apple Music for Artists Icon Leads to Speculation About iOS 15 Design Plans</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-revamped-apple-music-for-artists-icon-leads-to-speculation-about-ios-15-design-plans.2290830/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kG3uASW0Kr8:HkFNTOOjY40:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kG3uASW0Kr8:HkFNTOOjY40:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kG3uASW0Kr8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"68cbecb0a5949c61062bb376e2fc770ce7931f56a98d169dce3ef80f3ca66c9f","category":"Apple"}
