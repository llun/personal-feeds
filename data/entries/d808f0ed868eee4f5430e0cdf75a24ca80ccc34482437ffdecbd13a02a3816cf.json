Among the proposals put forward by President\nRichard M. Nixon in a November address was making daylight saving\ntime permanent for the next two winters. Despite scant evidence of\ndaylight saving time’s past benefit on the energy supply (dating\nback to DST’s various introductions since World War I), Americans\nreally liked the idea. Polling in November and December 1973\nshowed strong and in some cases overwhelming support — 57 percent\nin a Gallup poll, 74 percent in a Louis Harris and Associates\npoll, and 73 percent in a poll from the Roper Organization.</p>\n\n<p>The policy was quickly implemented in early January 1974. But it\njust as quickly fell out of favor.</p>\n\n<p>In a Roper poll conducted in February and March, just 30 percent\nremained in favor of year-round daylight saving time, while a\nmajority favored switching times again. Louis Harris polling in\nMarch showed just 19 percent of people said it had been a good\nidea, while about twice as many — 43 percent — said it was a\nbad one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What happened to change people’s minds? Dark mornings were unpopular. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/16/year-round-daylight-time\">I’m still in favor of trying year-round DST</a>, but it only seems fair to link to the other side of the argument, and it’s pretty interesting that public opinion changed so dramatically when we tried it a generation ago.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> Josh Barro, writing at Business Insider: “<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/daylight-saving-time-is-good-stop-complaining-2018-3\">Daylight-Saving Time Is Good, So Stop Complaining</a>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/23/case-against-year-round-dst\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d808f0ed868eee4f5430e0cdf75a24ca80ccc34482437ffdecbd13a02a3816cf","category":"Tech"}
