When the game was canceled in March of 2000, those lucky few became the only people outside of Konami to ever experience an exclusive <em>Castlevania</em> game on the system.</p>\n<p>Today, you can join them, as a playable version of the <em>Resurrection</em> demo has been <a href=\"https://en.sega-dreamcast-info-games-preservation.com/castlevania-resurrection-release\">uploaded to the Internet</a>.</p>\n<p>The long-lost demo comes to the wider world thanks to French Dreamcast preservationist Comby Laurent, who has <a href=\"https://www.sega-dreamcast-info-games-preservation.com/\">documented a number of unreleased Dreamcast prototypes on his website</a>. Laurent said he first became aware of a working copy of the <em>Resurrection</em> demo <a href=\"https://www.sega-dreamcast-info-games-preservation.com/castelvania-resurrection-dreamcast\">earlier this month</a> through an acquaintance who had provided the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXzbJMFwmCc\">first new video evidence of the demo in action</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760871#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760871&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"63cab3f849f0811e517de09fdd570ce724ad1836e17ee595ca6a729004772afd","category":"Tech"}
