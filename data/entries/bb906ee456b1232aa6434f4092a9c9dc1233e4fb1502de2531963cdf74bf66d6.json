As of Friday, the country had given more than 720 million vaccinations since mid-December, with nearly 400 million of those given in May alone.</p>\n<p>The dramatic ramp up comes at an awkward time, however. Early adopters of China’s vaccines have seen dramatic surges in COVID-19 cases—despite high vaccination rates—and are now backing away from the country’s offerings.</p>\n<p>In Bahrain, for instance, officials are now offering high-risk people who have already received two doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine a third vaccine dose—but one made by Pfizer-BioNTech. The apparent vote of no confidence by officials is striking: Bahrain was one of the first countries to back and rollout Sinopharm’s vaccine, and it has had a highly successful vaccination campaign. Nearly 58 percent of the Persian Gulf country has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and most of the vaccines given in Bahrain are from Sinopharm. But the country is now seeing its worst wave of COVID-19 yet and the government has recently issued a two-week lockdown to try to get transmission under control.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770201#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770201&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bb906ee456b1232aa6434f4092a9c9dc1233e4fb1502de2531963cdf74bf66d6","category":"Tech"}
