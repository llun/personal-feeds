It’s aimed at riders looking for complete authority at the front of their enduro bike or eMTB, where stiffness is king, and stout upper tubes help deliver that.</span></p>\n<p><span>As you’d expect, the Domain is offered in both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">wheel sizes</a>, across the whole travel range. Both the 27.5in and 29in forks share the same short 44mm offset for calm handling under pressure.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the top of the fork, three different depth (front to back) crowns will be offered at OEM level (for the forks you’ll end up seeing specced on off-the-shelf bikes).</span></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">Best mountain bike suspension forks</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Deeper crowns, as found on the Domain, should make the headtube of bikes such as this Evil look a little less awkward</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman</i></span></div>\n<p><span>This accounts for the oversized head tubes we’re seeing on numerous bikes these days. By offering a deeper crown, the line from frame to fork is smoother and looks less awkward. There’s no reported performance benefit to the different crowns, it’s just aesthetic. The aftermarket fork gets the standard 59mm crown, the smallest of the three.</span></p>\n<p>The eagle-eyed among you might have spotted above a reference to a 1.8in tapered steerer. This is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/bike-industry-mtb-standards/\">yet another new standard</a> that a small (but apparently growing) number of bike brands have asked for, most specifically for their eMTBs.</p>\n<p>Much like the change from 1-1/8in steerers to tapered, we suspect there are (theoretical) stiffness benefits. However, time will tell whether it catches on across the industry. This 1.8in tapered fork will have the deepest 69mm crown.</p>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        \n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p><span>Otherwise, 38mm stanchions feature, along with a Motion Control RC damper giving both compression and rebound adjustment on the aftermarket fork (there’ll be a simpler Motion Control R fork for OEM, too).</span></p>\n<p><span>On the air side of things, you get RockShox’s acclaimed DebonAir spring. This can take up to three Bottomless Tokens, with the 150mm and 160mm forks shipping with two pre-installed, the 170mm with one, and the 180mm fork with none plugged in to start.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Motion Control damper has been around for years, with incremental improvements over time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Inside the fork, RockShox is providing the Maxima Plush damping fluid, the first time the firm has offered this outside of the Signature Series range (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-zeb-fork/\">Zeb</a>/<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-debonair-spring-2021/\">Lyrik</a>/<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/rockshox-pike/\">Pike</a>/<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-rockshox-sid-forks-and-shock/\">SID</a>), which should further boost the fork’s slippery suppleness. All this combines to give a claimed weight of a shade over 2.5kg.</span></p>\n<p>Down at the base of the fork, the brake mount is designed straight for 200mm rotors. You’re covered if you want to run a 220mm rotor, with an adapter (and an adapter will also be needed if you’re running 203mm rotors).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h2>RockShox Domain price</h2>\n<p>The aftermarket Domain RC will cost £530 / $549 / €594 and will be available from July 2021.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The compression dial is easily accessible while on the bike, though a remote will be offered as an upgrade.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<h2>RockShox Domain – can you upgrade it?</h2>\n<p><span>The Domain can be upgraded down the line with RockShox’s easy-to-drop-in replacement damper units. </span></p>\n<p><span>The ‘R’ fork can have an RC damper fitted (£42 / $42 / €47) or both forks can receive a top-spec Charger 2.1 RC2 damper for £325 / £330 / €365, should you want absolute pro-level damping when you’ve the cash.</span></p>\n<p>There’s also a remote upgrade, should you want on-bar control of the compression circuit. The OneLoc lever costs £102 / $98 / €114.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The RockShox Domain is offered in both 27.5in and 29in wheel options, with travel from 150mm to 180mm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p><span>As the Domain features a 6000-series aluminium upper tube construction, you won’t be able to upgrade to the Zeb’s air spring, as the Zeb has a higher grade tubeset with different internal dimensions.</span></p>\n<p>Finally, on the upgrade front, a short fender can be added for £20 / $20 / €23. This bolts into the back of the fork’s brace. Aftermarket forks will come with a zip tie fender in the box. The use of fenders may compromise tyre clearance with 2.8in rubber.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A fender will be available for the Domain.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p><span>Given we’re seeing the Zeb popping up on a wide range of regular and electric mountain bikes, we suspect the new Domain will be a frequent sight down on the</span> trails, too.</p>\n<p>We have a Rockshox Domain here at BikeRadar, so expect a review very soon.</p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"712507a3dd442cd08f2666ca57be00ba35ecde429357e3d6e095c406fb26e02c","category":"Cycling"}
