Differentiating a forecast in Canada from a forecast in Phoenix is usually a breeze, but not in June. All-time high-temperature records—not just daily records—were smashed across the region. Portland International Airport broke its all-time record of 41.7°C (107°F) by a whopping 5°C (9°F). The small town of Lytton set a new record high <em>for the entire country of Canada</em> at 49.6°C (121.3°F) on June 29.

The number of heat-related deaths is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/29/canada-heat-dome-deaths/\">not yet fully known</a>.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/heat_PNW_2021_paper-14.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/heat_PNW_2021_paper-14-640x329.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/heat_PNW_2021_paper-14.jpg\">Maximum annual temperatures recorded at Portland International Airport.</a> (credit: Philip et al./WWA)</p></div>\n<p>As with other extreme weather events, the <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/\">World Weather Attribution</a> team has generated a rapid analysis of this heat wave in the context of climate change.
