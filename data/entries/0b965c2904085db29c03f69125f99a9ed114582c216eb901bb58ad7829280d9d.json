In another video, Long meets a PC user gaming on the MSI Gaming Stealth 15M laptop, powered by a Intel Core i7. Long then asks for a Mac, before swiftly agreeing with the PC user that \"no one games on a Mac.\" \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOther ads include Long throwing shade on Intel's behalf towards Apple's <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nYSm_HOg2kg\">lack of touchscreen Macs</a>, the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WfHplU5fatE\">inability</a> to plug more than one external display into &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs, and the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg\">variety of different options</a> available for laptops powered by Intel.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIntel undertook a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/intel-anti-mac-ad-campaign/\">similar marketing campaign in February</a> with a series of tweets highlighting the \"shortcomings\" of Apple's &zwnj;M1&zwnj; powered-Macs compared to Intel-powered computers. In November, Apple released its first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a> and is expected to fully transition its entire lineup away from Intel over the next couple of years.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis isn't the first time Long has featured in ad campaigns for Apple rivals. In 2017, the actor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/31/justin-long-joins-huawei-ad-campaign/\">starred</a> in a series of Huawei commercials promoting the company's Mate 9 smartphone.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/\">Former &#039;I&#039;m a Mac&#039; Actor Justin Long Throws Shade at M1 Apple Silicon in New Intel Ad Campaign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-im-a-mac-actor-justin-long-throws-shade-at-m1-apple-silicon-in-new-intel-ad-campaign.2288619/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P9wSobQTNY0:PltbCGJBgw0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P9wSobQTNY0:PltbCGJBgw0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/P9wSobQTNY0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0b965c2904085db29c03f69125f99a9ed114582c216eb901bb58ad7829280d9d","category":"Apple"}
