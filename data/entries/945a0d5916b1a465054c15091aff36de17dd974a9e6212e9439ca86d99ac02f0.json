Make it a part of your routine to check your tyres for wear and debris. Pay particular attention to the rear tyre as this will wear faster. You can switch the two around when the rear is starting to look tired, to get the maximum use out of both</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Scrimp on tyres. If you’re going to invest in any part of your bike, make it good quality tyres first. They’re your only point of contact with the road and you’ll feel an enormous difference compared to the cheaper tyres most new bikes are stocked with.</p>\n<p>Look at something from Michelin or Continental, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/3645/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\">and consider going tubeless</a></p>\n<h3>Keep your tyre pressure in check</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Regularly pump up your tyres. Running tyre pressure too low means you’re more susceptible to punctures. Riding with low pressure for extended periods can cause the rubber to deteriorate and eventually split when pressure is put back into the tyre.</p>\n<p>If you’re lucky enough to have a summer and winter bike, don’t forget to keep your summer tyres inflated to avoid returning to splits in the spring!</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Use the same pressure all year round. In the winter months, when the roads are wet, slippery or even icy, it’s a good idea to reduce your pressure by around 10psi to give you some additional traction</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vov7DZ7v22M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Use lubrication</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Use appropriate bicycle-specific lubricant for your local weather conditions. Wet chain lube and water displacing sprays on moving parts and cables are essential defences from the elements</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Use thick engine oil or put too much lubricant on the chain – it attracts road dirt and grime and starts acting like grinding paste, damaging other components</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSXWekuOvuo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Clean your bike</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Clean your bike regularly using bike-specific cleaning products. This will protect your expensive components from corrosion and mitigate against wear caused by the salt and grime on winter roads</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Use a jet wash! The pressure can force water past bearing seals. As there’s no pressure to push the water out again it can just sit there and cause corrosion to the actual bearings</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8T2TzQ0ChM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Use all your gears</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Use the full range of your gears when out riding. You’ll often go faster and you’ll wear your drivetrain evenly. Correct use of gears will ensure you maintain a straighter chain-line, reducing strain on your components</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Be afraid of shifting gears. Switching between smaller and larger chainrings while you move up and down the cassette will help keep your chain-line straight. Not only will this reduce wear, but as you’re using more of the sprockets they’ll all last longer than if you sit in the same ratio all of the time. </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjGCpDX35Bs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Check drivetrain wear</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Invest in a chain wear indicator and ensure that you monitor your chain regularly once you’ve ridden around 2,000km on it. Riding with a worn chain will eat through chainrings and cassettes far faster, costing you far more in the long run</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Assume the chain is not worn if the gears are still working well or attempt to visually inspect for wear. A worn chain is anything 'stretched' over 0.5mm and as it stretches it will wear down other components to fit its worn length. Use a tool to check chain wear, as shown above</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6iN0YX8PEA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Check brake pads and rim wear</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Make sure to align your brake pads in the centre of the braking surface, ensuring that no part of the pad is close to touching the tyre. You’ll be able to feel with your fingers when it’s time to replace the rim as the braking surface becomes concave. If you’re lucky to be running disc brakes, you can rest easy!</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Forget to check the pads as they wear. You’ll want to check that they are wearing evenly and replace them once you reach the wear indicators</p>\n<h3>Function over fashion in the winter</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Mudguards might not be the most stylish accessory but <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">they’re ideal in winter</a>. They’ll keep you and your riding partners more comfortable and dry. Mudguards catch and funnel road spray, reducing potential corrosion and shortening the task of cleaning</p>\n<p><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best bicycle mudguards for winter 2021 – protect your bike</a></p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Use your carbon race wheels through the winter. Wet roads will mean poor braking on carbon and increased wear on your rims. Save them for the summer months. If you’re using disc brakes, you can happily ignore this message</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zJoGrS0l6c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Take care of your cables</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Apply grease to your cables when you install them; protecting them from water incursion and making them run smoothly. Use water repellent spray on your cables and into the outers when you clean your bike. This will prevent your cables from seizing or rusting</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Cut your cables outers too short if you are installing or replacing them yourself. Short cables will cause increased friction and poor braking and shifting. If your cables are sticky or unresponsive, treating yourself to new ones is perhaps the most cost-effective upgrade you can make</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH5Ehzfg5lI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>Take care of your bolts</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Use grease, anti-seize or other appropriate agents on bolt threads to ensure the bolt stays in place correctly without seizing and use a torque wrench; especially on carbon frames and components</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Overtighten your bolts. This is a recipe for disaster for the home mechanic. This can cause parts to seize or fail entirely and can even void your warranty. Investing in a torque wrench is a great idea especially for the home mechanic with carbon components, many of which do not like to be clamped</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/tutorials/4356/how-to-maintain-your-bike-in-the-snow\">How to maintain your bike in the snow</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/4416/best-commuter-bikes\">The best commuter bikes 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9168/cycle-lane-removal-disproportionately-affects-young-people-charity-warns\">Cycle lane removal disproportionately affects young people, charity warns</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/9163/cycling-uk-led-by-women-for-first-time-in-143-year-history\">Cycling UK led by women for first time in 143 year history</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8818/king-alfreds-way-cycling-uk-route-bikepacking-touring\">King Alfred&#039;s Way: Conquering Wessex during Britain&#039;s wettest ever day</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Prepare for winter mechanicals</h3>\n<p><strong>DO</strong>... Carry extra tubes, multi-tool, chain tool and even a frame pump. Getting stuck at the side of the road is no fun at the best of times. The winter months are the harshest on your bike making mechanicals that bit more likely. Don’t get caught out, be prepared</p>\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong>... Discard your valve caps. Whilst this might to some seem like a style faux pas, valve caps through the winter are essential. Winter punctures are not much fun at the best of times but believe us, they’ll be far easier if the valve hasn’t seized with salt and grime from winter riding</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.havebike.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">havebike</a> is Britain’s largest collect and return bike repair company</em> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/bicycle-maintenance\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Bicycle maintenance</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"945a0d5916b1a465054c15091aff36de17dd974a9e6212e9439ca86d99ac02f0","category":"Cycling"}
