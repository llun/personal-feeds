{"title":"Latest Apple Music Beta for Android Adds Spatial and Lossless Audio","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-music-android-beta-spatial-lossless-audio/","date":1623743041000,"content":"When Apple last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-music-spatial-audio-launches-today/\">launched</a> Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, it said that the new features would be \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/apple-music-beta-lossless-music-streaming/\">coming soon</a>\" to Android. Now, the company has released a new ‌Apple Music‌ beta for the rival mobile platform that brings support for both features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/apple-music-album-cover-art.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs per the changelog for the release, spotted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/06/14/apple-music-android-spatial-lossless/\">9to5Google</a></em>:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>In this update, ‌Apple Music‌ adds spatial listening on compatible devices, with thousands of tracks in Dolby Atmos available at launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther updates include Lossless Audio, a new way to experience un-compromised sound, with bit-for-bit accuracy.</blockquote>In the app's Settings menu, there is a new \"Audio Quality\" sub-menu to enable Lossless Audio, and users can choose between the different tiers where applicable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe beta release for ‌Apple Music‌ 3.6 for Android also includes automatic crossfade and enhancements to the library in-line search function.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNote that lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file, and enabling the feature will consume significantly more data. For example, 10GB of space should store around 3,000 songs at high quality, but 1,000 songs with lossless, and just 200 songs with hi-res lossless.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGetting access to this version requires users signing up for the beta channel in the Play Store, but the fact that they are included suggests the wider ‌Apple Music‌ user base on Android won't have to wait much longer to get these features, too.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has not specified which Android devices might be compatible with Spatial Audio, but a wide range of Apple devices can access the feature including the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>‌ 7 and later, all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, the 6th-generation ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>‌ or later, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> 3 and later, the fifth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> and later, the 2018 or later MacBook Pro/<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and the 2020 or later <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-music-android-beta-spatial-lossless-audio/\">Latest Apple Music Beta for Android Adds Spatial and Lossless Audio</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-apple-music-beta-for-android-adds-spatial-and-lossless-audio.2300960/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=riEfdqQqRvU:7RZHuKgJOiM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=riEfdqQqRvU:7RZHuKgJOiM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/riEfdqQqRvU\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d697d7e59c8f5ba2e5a2555fec920d4793e00766156dd2699176cb9ec2176bb8","category":"Apple"}
