The team announced on Tuesday that it had signed a lengthy extension with longtime sponsor QuickStep that will see one of the sport’s highest-profile team continue to sport QuickStep’s name on its kit through 2027; meanwhile, Deceuninck has announced that it will stop sponsoring the team after 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The QuickStep announcement extends a partnership between the Belgian WorldTour outfit and Belgian flooring company that goes back to 2003.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news of a longterm sponsorship commitment for the squad is particularly notable in light of the uncertainty that has surrounded the future of the squad in recent seasons, as team CEO Patrick Lefevere has expressed uncertainty with some regularity over the past few years over whether his team would continue the following season. That said, Deceuninck-QuickStep had recently announced a few major deals that suggested that the team was perhaps on firmer ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, the squad <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/remco-evenepoel-signs-the-longest-extension-a-deceuninck-quickstep-rider-has-ever-signed/\" target=\"_blank\">signed rising star Remco Evenepoel</a> to the longest contract extension in the team’s history, and that same month, world road champ <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/julian-alaphilippe-will-ride-on-with-deceuninck-quickstep-through-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Julian Alaphilippe also extended</a> with the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are very happy to continue our partnership with Quick-Step, who have been at our side for over two decades now. It’s more than your usual sponsor extension; it’s proof that solid relationships exist in cycling, based on trust, mutual respect and shared values,” Lefevere said in a statement. “This long-term agreement will allow us to continue striving to improve the quality of our sports performances, to focus on the future and aim remain among the best in the sport.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While QuickStep will stay on board with the team, Deceuninck will call time on its partnership with the team after this season. The Belgian window and door fixture company has been a title sponsor since 2019.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/deceuninck-quickstep-secures-its-future-for-six-years-with-quickstep-deal/\">Deceuninck-QuickStep secures a longterm deal with one sponsor as another is set to leave</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"537e8f07e564e82bf7f623a801ff095f7f98f53ad155281cdc8b577e9f04c878","category":"Cycling"}
