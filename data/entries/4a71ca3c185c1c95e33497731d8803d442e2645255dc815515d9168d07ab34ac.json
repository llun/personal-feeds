{"title":"HashiCraft Holiday Hackathon Wrap Up","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicraft-holiday-hackathon-wrap-up","date":1611086400000,"content":"<p>Before the holidays, we announced the HashiCraft Holiday Hackathon, a fun little event where the HashiCorp community can show off their creativity and learn something new about the HashiCorp tools. In this post, we are excited to share the winning entries with you, a hackathon is a great way to learn some new skills, and we think the entries were terrific.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#winner-of-the-best-pet-related-hack\" aria-label=\"winner of the best pet related hack permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"winner-of-the-best-pet-related-hack\" aria-hidden></a>Winner of the Best Pet-Related Hack</h2>\n<h3><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#team-petmas-a-curated-festive-twitter-feed\" aria-label=\"team petmas a curated festive twitter feed permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"team-petmas-a-curated-festive-twitter-feed\" aria-hidden></a>Team Petmas - A Curated Festive Twitter Feed</h3>\n<p><strong>Grace Nguyen</strong></p>\n<p>Our first winner is Grace and her fantastic application, which curates a Twitter feed full of Holiday pets, Petmas.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610551966-petmas1.png alt=Petmas Twitter Feed><p>To create Petmas, Grace wrote a scraper in Python that uses the Twitter API and Selenium to gather the data, storing it in an Azure SQL database.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610737657-petmas2.png alt=petmas architectural overview><p>To present the information, Grace created a Python Flask API, which exposes the data to a JavaScript frontend using the React framework. Grace also uses HashiCorp Terraform to provision the database and the infrastructure To Azure.</p>\n<p>Throughout this exercise, Grace says that she has learned many new things, from buying a domain to running her server and learning Terraform.</p>\n<p>We love your project Grace, and we also love your video, which explains what you built; it is all incredibly well done.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzbWrAY2muI&feature=youtu.be frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>Project Repository:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gracenng/petmas\">https://github.com/gracenng/petmas</a></p>\n<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-n-nguyen/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-n-nguyen/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gracenng\">https://twitter.com/gracenng</a></p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#winner-of-the-emoji-and-ascii-art-category\" aria-label=\"winner of the emoji and ascii art category permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"winner-of-the-emoji-and-ascii-art-category\" aria-hidden></a>Winner of the Emoji and ASCII Art Category</h2>\n<h3><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#team-reulan-clairvoyance-a-terraform-drift-detector\" aria-label=\"team reulan clairvoyance a terraform drift detector permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"team-reulan-clairvoyance-a-terraform-drift-detector\" aria-hidden></a>Team Reulan - Clairvoyance a Terraform Drift Detector</h3>\n<p><strong>Michael Simo</strong></p>\n<p>We love Michael’s tool Clairvoyance, which reports drift in your Terraform state. Clairvoyance scans directories containing Terraform code and uses Terraform Exec to initialize and generate a plan for the Terraform configuration it discovers.</p>\n<p>Clairvoyance interprets this data and produces a report that notifies you if the state for your Terraform-managed infrastructure has changed, giving you an early warning to correct any issues. The report Clairvoyance generates can either be written to StdOut or posted to a Discord server.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610558435-clairvoyance1.png alt=Clairvoyance Report><p>Future plans for Clairvoyance are to build a Docker container so that Michael can run it on Kubernetes as a Cron job.</p>\n<p>While building this project, Michael said he learned a lot about Go, specifically how to parallelize operations using goroutines and channels. Micheal also streamed the whole process on his brilliant Twitch channel; we recommend you head over there and give him a follow.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"https://player.twitch.tv/?video=863033412&parent=preview.hashicorp.com&autoplay=false&time=3m17s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" height=\"378\" width=\"620\"></iframe></div>\n<p><strong>Twitch:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/reulan\">https://www.twitch.tv/reulan</a></p>\n<p><strong>Website:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://reulan.com/\">https://reulan.com/</a></p>\n<p><strong>GitHub:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reulan\">https://github.com/reulan</a></p>\n<p><strong>Project Repository:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reulan/clairvoyance\">https://github.com/reulan/clairvoyance</a></p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#winner-of-the-festive-lighting-category\" aria-label=\"winner of the festive lighting category permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"winner-of-the-festive-lighting-category\" aria-hidden></a>Winner of the Festive Lighting Category</h2>\n<h3><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#team-sharebear-terraform-provider-to-control-argb-lighting\" aria-label=\"team sharebear terraform provider to control argb lighting permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"team-sharebear-terraform-provider-to-control-argb-lighting\" aria-hidden></a>Team Sharebear - Terraform Provider to Control ARGB Lighting</h3>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Share</strong></p>\n<p>Jonathan has built a Terraform provider that can interact with the open-source Falcon Player for configuring addressable RGB lighting.</p>\n<p>Falcon Player runs on a RaspberryPi or Beagle Bone black and exposes an interface to control ARGB lighting strips that use the WS2811 or WS2812b standard.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610558772-sharebear1.png alt=Falcon Player Terraform Provider><p>It is clear to see how a Terraform provider can help with Falcon Player’s configuration; there are many different options such as the ARGB lights connection, the sequence file for the animation, a playlist, and optionally a schedule. Jonathan has elegantly encapsulated these options in his Terraform provider.</p>\n<p>Using his provider, Jonathan can <code>terraform apply</code> the lights for his Xmas tree. We especially love the HashiCorp colors used in his demo. We recommend you check out Jonathan’s demo video; he explains the provider and demos the full setup. When we saw the final demo at 8:20 in the video, it blew our minds. We will 100% be setting this up at HashiCraft towers next holiday season.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=https://vimeo.com/493320644 frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanshare/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanshare/</a></p>\n<p><strong>GitLab:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/sharebear\">https://gitlab.com/sharebear</a></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonnyshare\">https://twitter.com/jonnyshare</a></p>\n<p><strong>Blog:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://blog.sharebear.co.uk/\">https://blog.sharebear.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Project Repository:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/sharebear/terraform-provider-fpp\">https://gitlab.com/sharebear/terraform-provider-fpp</a></p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#winner-of-the-securest-team-gifting-exchange-ever-category\" aria-label=\"winner of the securest team gifting exchange ever category permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"winner-of-the-securest-team-gifting-exchange-ever-category\" aria-hidden></a>Winner of the Securest Team Gifting Exchange Ever Category</h2>\n<h3><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#west-coast-ninjas-the-grinch-exchange\" aria-label=\"west coast ninjas the grinch exchange permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"west-coast-ninjas-the-grinch-exchange\" aria-hidden></a>West Coast Ninjas - The Grinch Exchange</h3>\n<p><strong>Shobana Shastry</strong></p>\n<p>We should have excluded this team for not including us in the gift exchange, but we decided instead to award the prize of the most secure gift exchange in the spirit of the holidays.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610560718-wcn1.png alt=Grinch Exchange><p>Shobs spun up a HashiCorp Vault cluster using Terraform and created a frontend interface using NodeJS.

An extension for deploying Vault and storing secrets in Home Assistant and a Terraform provider for Home Assistant enables all-around festive control of your lighting, music, and video.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610564606-nowel1.png alt=nowel xmas><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1610564623-nowel2.png alt=nowel holiday><p>The team also created some Terraform modules for other holidays such as easter.</p>\n<p>In their video, the team mentioned that hacking on this project allowed them to learn Go, and it was the first time they had tried to build a Terraform provider. We think they did a fantastic job, and it looks like they had lots of fun doing it.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM5IfW3SPY0&feature=youtu.be frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleonore-carpentier\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleonore-carpentier</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-leclerc-6327101/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-leclerc-6327101/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/corentinmors/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/corentinmors/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeScops\">https://twitter.com/MikeScops</a></p>\n<p><strong>Terraform Provider Project Repository:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Mikescops/terraform-provider-homeassistant\">https://github.com/Mikescops/terraform-provider-homeassistant</a></p>\n<p><strong>Vault Add on Project Repository:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tidalf/ha-addon-vault\">https://github.com/tidalf/ha-addon-vault</a></p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#summary\" aria-label=\"summary permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"summary\" aria-hidden></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted an entry; they were all fantastic.
