{"title":"The EFF: ‘Google’s FLoC Is a Terrible Idea’","link":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea","date":1614910322000,"content":"\n<p>Bennett Cyphers, writing for the EFF:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google is leading the charge to replace third-party cookies with a\nnew suite of technologies to target ads on the Web. And some of\nits proposals show that it hasn’t learned the right lessons from\nthe ongoing backlash to the surveillance business model. This post\nwill focus on one of those proposals, <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/floc\">Federated Learning of\nCohorts (FLoC)</a>, which is perhaps the most ambitious — and\npotentially the most harmful.</p>\n\n<p>FLoC is meant to be a new way to make your browser do the\nprofiling that third-party trackers used to do themselves: in this\ncase, boiling down your recent browsing activity into a behavioral\nlabel, and then sharing it with websites and advertisers. The\ntechnology will avoid the privacy risks of third-party cookies,\nbut it will create new ones in the process. It may also exacerbate\nmany of the worst non-privacy problems with behavioral ads,\nincluding discrimination and predatory targeting.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s pitch to privacy advocates is that a world with FLoC (and\nother elements of the “<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web\">privacy sandbox</a>”) will be better than\nthe world we have today, where data brokers and ad-tech giants\ntrack and profile with impunity. But that framing is based on a\nfalse premise that we have to choose between “old tracking” and\n“new tracking.” It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the\ntracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the\nmyriad problems of targeted ads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This helps explain Google’s message <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/03/google-temkin-ad-tracking\">yesterday</a>. They’re moving their tracking from third-party cookies that they process through the cloud to tracking that’s done in Chrome. Basically I think that’s it.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer a Chromium-based browser, you should use one other than Chrome. I like <a href=\"https://brave.com/\">Brave</a> for my (occasional) Chromium browser needs, but <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge\">Microsoft’s Edge</a> might be a good choice too. Brave bills itself as a privacy browser; at this point it seems fair to say Google is turning Chrome into an anti-privacy browser. It’s that simple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘The EFF: ‘Google’s FLoC Is a Terrible Idea’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/04/eff-google-floc\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"65dd35455061548728e2d4a9a4753460e2c65875b982b7baf9567d88a829df09","category":"Tech"}
