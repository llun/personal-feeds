While users have been\nable to continue to use the tool on M1 Macs during this period,\ntoday’s development means a considerable boost in speed and\nperformance. Overall, Illustrator users will see a 65 percent\nincrease in performance on an M1 Mac, versus Intel builds — InDesign users will see similar gains, with a 59 percent\nimprovement on overall performance on Apple Silicon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Specific things like opening complex documents and scrolling are even faster than those overall numbers: Adobe claims scrolling in Illustrator is 4× faster.
