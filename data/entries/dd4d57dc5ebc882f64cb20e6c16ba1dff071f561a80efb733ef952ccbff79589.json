This category includes devices that are not able to run ‌iOS 14‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for iPadOS, 91 percent of all iPads introduced in the last four years are running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a>, and 79 percent of all devices have the ‌iOS 14‌ update installed.

At that time, 86 percent of iPhones introduced in the last four years had ‌iOS 14‌ installed, and 80 percent of all iPhones ran ‌iOS 14‌, so ‌iOS 14‌ adoption rates have seen decent growth with the release of iOS 14.5.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe updated ‌iOS 14‌ adoption numbers come just ahead of the 32nd annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which will see the debut of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and iPadOS 15. Apple's focus will shift from ‌iOS 14‌ to ‌iOS 15‌ following WWDC, as the company will be refining and updating the new operating system ahead of its fall launch.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ios-14-installation-rates-june-2021/\">iOS 14 Now Installed on 90% of iPhones Released in Last Four Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-14-now-installed-on-90-of-iphones-released-in-last-four-years.2299222/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dz4-PSDnl1Y:I_8tcM1uTFw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dz4-PSDnl1Y:I_8tcM1uTFw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dz4-PSDnl1Y\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dd4d57dc5ebc882f64cb20e6c16ba1dff071f561a80efb733ef952ccbff79589","category":"Apple"}
