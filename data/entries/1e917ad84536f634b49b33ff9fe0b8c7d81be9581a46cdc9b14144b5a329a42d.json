Access to the source code allows you to more easily integrate your applications, troubleshoot problems, and build more reliable and performant applications that use <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span>.</p> \n<p>You can add or remove pre-built software components based on your IoT use case and your device’s CPU and memory resources. For example, you can choose to include pre-built AWS IoT Greengrass components such as stream manager only when you need to process data streams with your application, or machine learning components only when you want to perform machine learning inference locally on your devices.</p> \n<p>The <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> IoT Greengrass 2.0 includes a new command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to locally develop and debug applications on your device. In addition, there is a new local debug console that helps you visually debug applications on your device. With these new capabilities, you can rapidly develop and debug code on a test device before using the cloud to deploy to your production devices.</p> \n<p><span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0 is also integrated with AWS IoT thing groups, enabling you to easily organize your devices in groups and manage application deployments across your devices with features to control rollout rates, timeouts, and rollbacks.</p> \n<p><strong><u><span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0 – Getting Started</u></strong><br /> Device builders can use <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0 by going to the <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> console where you can find a download and install command that you run on your device. Once the installer is downloaded to the device, you can use it to install Greengrass software with all essential features, register the device as an AWS IoT Thing, and create a simple “hello world” software component in less than 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>To get started in the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?#/greengrassIntro\"><span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> console</a>, you first register a test device by clicking <strong>Set up core device</strong>. You assign the name and group of your core device. To deploy to only the core device, select <strong>No group</strong>. In the next step, install the <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> Core software in your device.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44375\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/11/27/2020-greengrass2-install.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2182\" height=\"1402\" /></p> \n<p>When the installer completes, you can find your device in the list of <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> Core devices on the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?#greengrass/v2/cores\">Core devices</a> page.</p> \n<p><span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> components enable you to develop and deploy software to your <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> Core devices. You can write your application functionality and bundle it as a private component for deployment. <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> also provides public components, which provide pre-built software for common use cases that you can deploy to your devices as you develop your device software. When you finish developing the software for your component, you can register it with <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span>. Then, you can deploy and run the component on your <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> Core devices.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45915\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/15/2020-greengrass2-component-new.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2392\" height=\"1372\" /></p> \n<p>To create a component, click the <strong>Create component</strong> button on the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?#/greengrass/v2/components\">Components</a> page. You can use a recipe or import an <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" title=\"\">AWS Lambda</a> function. The component recipe is a <code>YAML</code> or <code>JSON</code> file that defines the component’s details, dependencies, compatibility, and lifecycle. To learn about the specifications, visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/greengrass/v2/component-recipe-reference\">recipe reference guide</a>.</p> \n<p>Here is an example of a <code>YAML</code> recipe.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45899\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/15/2020-greengrass2-componet-recipe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2004\" height=\"1422\" /></p> \n<p>When you finish developing your component, you can add it to a deployment configuration to deploy to one or more core devices. To create a new deployment or configure the components to deploy to core devices, click the <strong>Create</strong> button on the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?#/greengrass/v2/deployments\">Deployments</a> page. You can deploy to a core device or a thing group as a target, and select the components to deploy. The deployment includes the dependencies for each component that you select.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45916\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/15/2020-greengrass2-deployments-new.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2305\" height=\"1411\" /></p> \n<p>You can edit the version and parameters of selected components and advanced settings such as the rollout configuration, which defines the rate at which the configuration deploys to the target devices; timeout configuration, which defines the duration that each device has to apply the deployment; or cancel configuration, which defines when to automatically stop the deployment.</p> \n<p><strong><u>Moving to <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0</u></strong><br /> Existing devices running <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 1.x will continue to run without any changes. If you want to take advantage of new <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0 features, you will need to move your existing <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 1.x devices and workloads to <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0. To learn how to do this, visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/move-from-v1.html\">migration guide</a>.</p> \n<p>After you move your 1.x applications over, you can start adding components to your applications using new version 2 features, while leaving your version 1 code as-is until you decide to update them.</p> \n<p><strong><u><span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0 Partners</u></strong><br /> At launch, industry-leading partners NVIDIA and NXP have qualified a number of their devices for <span title=\"\">AWS IoT Greengrass</span> 2.0:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000000TZ37EAG/Nvidia-Jetson-AGX-Xavier-Developer-Kit\">NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000002yX85EAE/Jetson-AGX-Xavier-32GB-Module\">NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier 32GB Module</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000000TZ4AEAW/Nvidia%C2%AE-Jetson%E2%84%A2-Nano-Developer-Kit\">NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000002yXSPEA2/Jetson-Nano-Module\">NVIDIA Jetson Nano Module</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0L00000AANt4UAH/Nvidia-Jetson-TX2-Developer-Kit\">NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Developer Kit</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000000OQaiEAG/NVIDIA-Jetson-TX2-Module\">NVIDIA Jetson TX2 Module</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000007dkcUEAQ/Nvidia-Jetson-Xavier-NX\">NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h0000088N7dEAE/S32G-VNP-EVB\">NXP S32G-VNP-EVB</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000007ct1wEAA/S32G-VNP-RDB\">NXP S32G-VNP-RDB</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>See all partner device listings in the <a href=\"https://devices.amazonaws.com/\">AWS Partner Device Catalog</a>.
