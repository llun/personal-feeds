Basic mode means we'll get smart TVs with a \"dumb TV\" mode.</p>\n<p>The rise of smart TVs has led to the extinction of dumb TVs—today, basically every TV has some kind of computer and operating system built into it. If you're actually expecting to live with a TV for several years, the problem with smart TVs is that the dirt-cheap computers inside these TVs don't last as long as the display does. When your smart TV is a few years old, you might still have a perfectly good display panel, but you'll be forced to interact with it through a slow, old, possibly abandoned integrated computer. Companies <em>should</em> sell dumb TVs without any of this crap permanently integrated into them, but if they refuse, letting consumers turn off the software is the next best thing.</p>\n<p>When the new feature rolls out, you'll be asked to choose between \"Basic TV\" or \"Google TV\" at setup. 9to5Google says that with basic mode, \"almost everything is stripped, leaving users with just HDMI inputs and Live TV if they have an antenna plugged directly into the TV. Casting support, too, is dropped.\" The UI notes that you'll be turning off all apps, the Google Assistant, and personalized recommendations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745483#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745483&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"414e8d9b88d35e661d80bfdae72d02a52210585efcad10fdf00fd88f4c54c8fb","category":"Tech"}
