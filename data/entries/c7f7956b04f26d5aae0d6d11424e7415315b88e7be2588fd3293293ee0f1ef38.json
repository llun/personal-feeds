In a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">note seen by <em>MacRumors</em></a> yesterday, Kuo explained that Apple is reluctant to move to USB-C since it is a free, open standard, as well as less waterproof than Lightning.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>We believe that USB-C is detrimental to the MFi business's profitability, and its waterproof specification is lower than Lightning and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCurrently, Apple is able to strictly regulate the quality of Lightning cables and accessories through its Made for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (MFi) program. MFi also generates a significant amount of income for the company since third-party manufacturers have to pay Apple a considerable commission to make Lightning cables or accessories.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2012/09/iphone_5_lightning.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"311\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-352060\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has used the Lightning connector on every &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 in 2012, but it has transitioned several of its devices to USB-C, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-announces-2020-ipad-air/\">most recently</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. With the need to connect to external drives being less pressing and some USB-C features such as external display connectivity outright impossible on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple is understandably less motivated to switch to USB-C on its most profitable product for MFi.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTransitioning the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to USB-C this year would also leave a significant number of devices such as the entry-level <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, and a plethora of accessories such as the Magic Trackpad and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Duo charger, stuck with a connector that would no longer be widely used on any flagship products. Switching the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to USB-C may, therefore, tip the scales against Lightning across Apple's product lineup, potentially forcing the company to phase out the connector entirely across a large number of products sooner than it wants to. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAmid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/iphone-13-could-remove-another-standard-feature/\">rumors of a portless iPhone</a>, Kuo clarified that Apple is more likely to switch directly to a portless model rather than first change to USB-C:\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>If the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt the portless design with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; support instead of using a USB-C port.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn spite of this, Kuo stated that &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; wireless charging technology is not yet ready to displace a wired port, having only debuted as recently as October 2020 on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; is currently unable to transfer data, complete a device recovery, or take diagnostics, which would seemingly be essential features on a future &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with no ports.<blockquote>At present, the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; ecosystem is not mature enough, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will continue to use the Lightning port in the foreseeable future.</blockquote>Overall, this means that Apple is intending <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">to stick with the Lightning connector</a> for the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> at minimum, but could well extend to models beyond that, too.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo's recent spate of reports about the future of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; included the speculation that in 2022, at least some &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models will abandon the notch and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">switch to a \"punch-hole display design\"</a> instead, and in 2023, Apple may <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/\">unveil a 7.5â€“8 inch foldable iPhone</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/iphone-keeping-lightning-no-usb-c/\">iPhone Sticking With Lightning Port Over USB-C for &#039;Foreseeable Future&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sticking-with-lightning-port-over-usb-c-for-foreseeable-future.2286784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XVwZJ6PxYIg:nBP3Lv3dQE4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XVwZJ6PxYIg:nBP3Lv3dQE4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XVwZJ6PxYIg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c7f7956b04f26d5aae0d6d11424e7415315b88e7be2588fd3293293ee0f1ef38","category":"Apple"}
