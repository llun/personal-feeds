That’s despite the fact that the nearest I came to the action in person was getting my nose really close up to the telly.</p>\n<p>Starting with a cracking early season that was stopped unexpectedly in its tracks, the radically back-loaded 2020 calendar saw conventions turned upside down, plans switched and unlikely champions crowned.</p>\n<p>Of course, the reason for this upheaval was the <a href=\"/tags/coronavirus\">Covid pandemic</a>. It was also the reason that once racing was allowed to reconvene, the vicarious thrill of watching people racing their bikes was all the more exciting.</p>\n<p>Now onto its third year, <em>The Road Book</em> bills itself as cycling’s definitive almanack. At almost 650 pages this hardback volume contains month-by-month stats and results from every important race of the season, along with essays and profiles from many of the key players.</p>\n<p>It’s hard not to think that at three years old it’s already chronicling some pretty radical cycling history.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43654\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/03/the_road_book_tdf_detail.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Reliving a very strange year</h3>\n<p>Compiled by commentator and uber-nerd Ned Boulting, it’s kind of what I imagine the inside of <em>Cyclist</em>’s Joseph Robinson's head to be like. While I have Wikipedia and ProCyclingStats, both he and Ned share the unnerving ability to recall facts and results from races like some kind of human filing system.</p>\n<p>However, as I learned during the lockdown, forgetting has its benefits. For while it does render me a poor addition to a pub quiz team, I do get to experience increased joy in reliving things I’ve already forgotten. <em>The Road Book</em> majors on this kind of rapid-turnaround nostalgia.</p>\n<p>Arranged chronologically, smaller races get a page per stage, while bigger events like the Grand Tours get two. Creating a narrative out of stats and results so thorough as to include both temperature and wind speed on the day, <em>The Road Book</em> also includes writing from some of the best keyboards in cycling journalism.</p>\n<p>Further fleshed out by essays any magazine would jump at the chance to publish, the result is a holistic account of the season from multiple perspectives.</p>\n<p>So in between race reports you get Nicholas Dlamini on growing up in a South African township and making it to the WorldTour, only to have his arm broken by a ranger while out on a training ride; Anna van der Breggen on a season she took the Giro Rosa along with two World Championship jerseys; and Tao Geoghegan Hart on finding a way through the late-season snow to a stunning first Grand Tour Victory.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist</em> readers can get an exclusive Road Book bookmark with each new copy of the 2020 edition purchased, simply enter code 20RBCYCLIST at checkout.

For example <em>Cycling News</em> editor Laura Weislo gets 2,500 words to cover how cycling adapted to Covid, both in terms of the faltering season along with the turbo-charged adoption of virtual racing, while author Max Leonard gets a similar space to cover cycling’s history of war, pandemic and not racing.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43655\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/03/road_book_cyclingimages-00373.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>At the races</h3>\n<p>Besides all this worthy and very well written stuff is the season itself. It’s a bit mean to criticise <em>The Road Book</em> for something beyond its control, but with less racing, this edition is the slimmest so far. However, what it loses in page count it makes up for in drama.</p>\n<p>Covid notwithstanding, <a href=\"/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tadej Pogačar</a>’s stunning final stage overthrowing of presumptive Tour de France winner <a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\">Primož Roglič</a> was a huge moment for cycling. Ditto <a href=\"/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> and <a href=\"/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a>’s psychodrama in Flanders, or Chloe Dygert crashing out at the World Champs.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8831/tadej-pogacar-the-man-who-would-be-king\">Tadej Pogacar: The man who would be king</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/6834/how-much-did-tadej-pogacar-earn-for-winning-the-tour-de-france-and-how-does-that-compare\">How much did Tadej Pogacar earn for winning the Tour de France and how does that compare to other sports?</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9283/adidas-launches-spd-version-of-samba-trainers\">Adidas launches SPD version of Samba trainers</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/2252/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2021: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 111: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAlready seeming like a long time ago, I’d bet good money on the 2020 season being viewed as a particularly vintage year the further we make it into the future. Assuming you have a bookcase large enough to store it and don’t mind the hefty £50 price-tag, <em>The Road Book</em> is also likely to improve with age.</p>\n<p>I’ll definitely be hanging on to my copy. For one thing, flicking through it is about the only way I can remember what I was doing during any given month of the past year – even if I already know the answer is just watching the bike racing on TV.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist</em> readers can get an exclusive Road Book bookmark with each new copy of the 2020 edition purchased, simply enter code 20RBCYCLIST at checkout.
