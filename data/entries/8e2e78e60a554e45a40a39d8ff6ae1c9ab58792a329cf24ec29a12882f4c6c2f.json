Apple provides independent repair shops with the same free training and tools provided to AASPs and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a> locations.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Apple, there are more than <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/repair/verify-repair-provider\">1,500 Independent Repair Provider locations</a> across the United States, Canada, and Europe. There is no cost to join the program, but repair providers must have an Apple-certified technician to perform the repairs. Apple says that the certification process is \"simple\" and free of charge, and when an employee has become a certified technician, qualifying repair providers are able to purchase genuine Apple parts and tools at the same price as AASPs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nStarting later this week, repair providers in Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Guam, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Macao, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tonga, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, and Vietnam can <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/irp-program/\">learn more and apply</a> to become Independent Repair Providers. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLater this year, the program will launch in a range of additional countries, with a full list available <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally/\">in Apple's announcement</a>. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-expands-independent-repair-program-worldwide/\">Apple Expanding Independent Repair Provider Program Worldwide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expanding-independent-repair-provider-program-worldwide.2290000/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qJju0mY_eBs:z1llZh_XgMc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qJju0mY_eBs:z1llZh_XgMc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qJju0mY_eBs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8e2e78e60a554e45a40a39d8ff6ae1c9ab58792a329cf24ec29a12882f4c6c2f","category":"Apple"}
