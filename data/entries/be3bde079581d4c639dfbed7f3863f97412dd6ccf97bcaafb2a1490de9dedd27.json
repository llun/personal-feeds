Nearly half of survey respondents also said that fuel economy is very important when considering a vehicle to buy or lease, and 27 percent were very worried about car exhaust contributing to climate change.</p>\n<p>Consequently, Consumer Reports will now grade cars according to their environmental impact. It has launched a new \"green choice\" rating, identified by a green leaf icon, to help people quickly identify vehicles with the best fuel efficiency and lowest contributions to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels and smog formation.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the survey also shows that nearly half of car buyers will use information about a vehicle's emissions to inform their buying—but only if they know where to look. Unfortunately, more than 50 percent are unaware that this information is displayed prominently on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroney_sticker\">the Monroney sticker</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744193#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744193&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
