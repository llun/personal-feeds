Bahrain Victorious led the way into the last few hundred meters for Sonny Colbrelli, who launched his sprint with around 300 meters to go with Sagan tucked in behind. Colbrelli led into the last 150 meters, but Sagan then surged past to take the victory at the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colbrelli settled for second with Patrick Bevin taking third on the day. Rohan Dennis, who won Monday’s prologue, finished safely with the pack to retain his overall race lead.</p>\n\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Tour de Romandie (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>Aigle → Martigny</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255761\">Full results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>1</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">SAGAN Peter</a>\n                                        <span>BORA -
