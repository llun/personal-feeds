{"title":"Deals: AirPods With Wired Charging Case Return to Holiday Pricing of $109.99 ($49 Off)","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/deals-airpods-wired/","date":1612793164000,"content":"Amazon today is discounting the AirPods with Wired Charging Case to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"><strong>&#36;109.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;159.00. In 2021, the best price we'd seen for this model of AirPods was around &#36;120, so this marks the best price seen so far this year among the major Apple resellers online.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/AirPods-Discount-Feature-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-752634\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

While this model saw a discounted price to &#36;99 at select retailers for Black Friday 2020, those sales didn't last long, and the most common price tag over the holiday season ended up being about &#36;110.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for &#36;109.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAmazon is also matching another low price on the AirPods Pro, but stock has run out and won't return until March 7, as of writing. You can still lock in the AirPods Pro for a price of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00, thanks to an automatic coupon that you'll see reflected at the checkout screen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis AirPods Pro sale is a match of Woot's &#36;189.99 price tag that we saw earlier this month, and frequently over the holidays. Woot's sale has since expired, and Amazon's has proved popular, given the delayed shipping estimate.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/deals-airpods-wired/\">Deals: AirPods With Wired Charging Case Return to Holiday Pricing of &#36;109.99 (&#36;49 Off)</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-airpods-with-wired-charging-case-return-to-holiday-pricing-of-109-99-49-off.2283815/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4SsVMXNoxm8:8cWf_vrWFkM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4SsVMXNoxm8:8cWf_vrWFkM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4SsVMXNoxm8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db8748bd9bbe9f376bee0a07afd0675bd65da0c0d056239374c13939407b65a8","category":"Apple"}
