The proposed legislation would usher in sweeping changes both in the way monopoly regulations are enforced and in how companies run their platforms. They would require divestments in some cases while mandating interoperability and portability in others.<span> </span></p>\n<p>“Right now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy,” said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who introduced one of the bills. “They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers, and put folks out of work. Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773208#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773208&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"38f82ab0fd75f72565bbba40a7e49810fdd54999dace5e0b661835651fd144a7","category":"Tech"}
