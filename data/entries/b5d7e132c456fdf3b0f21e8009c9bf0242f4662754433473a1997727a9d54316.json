The chasing peloton then split on the Taaienberg inside the last 60 km while the prior escapees were caught, and then Van Baarle joined <strong>Ethan Hayter</strong>, <strong>Stan Dewulf</strong>, <strong>Bram Welten</strong>, <strong>Nils Politt</strong>, <strong>Tim Wellens</strong>, and <strong>Alexander Kristoff</strong> pushing clear on the run-in to the Berg Ten Houte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moments later, however, Van Baarle powered away on his own and quickly built his advantage. His gap had climbed over 30 seconds within a few kilometers, while behind, there were attacks and regroupings among those chasing. Van Baarle continued to maintain a decent gap over the ensuing climbs as big names tried to bridge and then were brought back. With 20 km to go, Van Baarle was out front with a 30-second gap to a group of chasers that included <strong>Greg Van Avermaet</strong> and a few other big names, with a bigger pack a further 25 seconds back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Baarle&#8217;s advantage hardly wavered from there on out, while the pack ultimately reeled in the group in between. Van Baarle held on to take a comfortable win at the line with Laporte besting Merlier in the sprint 26 seconds later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 VAN BAARLE Dylan (Ineos Grenadiers) 3:58:59<br>2 LAPORTE Christophe (Cofidis) 0:26<br>3 MERLIER Tim (Alpecin-Fenix)<br>4 LAMPAERT Yves (Deceuninck-QuickStep)<br>5 VAN DER SANDE Tosh (Lotto Soudal)<br>6 KRISTOFF Alexander (UAE-Team Emirates)<br>7 VAN AVERMAET Greg (AG2R Citroën)<br>8 TURGIS Anthony (Total Direct Energie)<br>9 SÉNÉCHAL Florian (Deceuninck-QuickStep)<br>10 STUYVEN Jasper (Trek-Segafredo)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Van Vleuten gets her first win with Movistar at Dwars door Vlaanderen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Annemiek van Vleueten</strong> took her first win of 2021 and her first with Movistar on Wednesday at <strong>Dwars door Vlaanderen</strong>. <strong>Kasia Niewiadoma</strong> finished second on the day with <strong>Alexis Ryan</strong> rounding out the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI 1.1-rated race set out from Waregem in balmy conditions, and things stayed relatively calm over the first half of the race before attacks flew on the Kruisberg with some 60 km to go. Splits and regroupings whittled the peloton down, and then Van Vleuten attacked on the Knotenberg with 36 km to go. Only Niewiadoma could follow, and the duo pressed on together to build a sizable gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were several attempts to bridge out of a strong group of chasers, but there was no catching the lead pair, who rolled into Waregem to battle for the win between themselves. In the final sprint, Van Vleuten kicked with 300 meters to go and held on to nab the victory. Niewiadoma settled for second, and Ryan won the sprint for third 19 seconds later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 VAN VLEUTEN Annemiek (Movistar) 3:04:04<br>2 NIEWIADOMA Katarzyna (Canyon-SRAM)<br>3 RYAN Alexis (Canyon-SRAM) 0:19<br>4 GUAZZINI Vittoria (Valcar-Travel &amp; Service)<br>5 JACKSON Alison (Liv)<br>6 BROWN Grace (BikeExchange)<br>7 MACKAIJ Floortje (DSM)<br>8 BUJAK Eugenia (Alé BTC Ljubljana)<br>9 VAN DIJK Ellen (Trek-Segafredo)<br>10 BORGLI Stine (FDJ Nouvelle Aquitaine Futuroscope)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Van der Poel acknowledges that he wasn&#8217;t at his best at Dwars door Vlaanderen but downplays concerns for Flanders form</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathieu van der Poel</strong> said after <strong>Dwars door Vlaanderen</strong> on Wednesday that he was not at his best in the race, but he also downplayed any concerns that his form wouldn&#8217;t be where he wanted at the upcoming <strong>Tour of Flanders</strong>, where he will start as the defending champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Dwars door Vlaanderen finale, Van der Poel raced for teammate <strong>Tim Merlier</strong>, who went on to nab third on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would have preferred to race for the win, but that was just not possible with my legs,&#8221; van der Poel said, acknowledging that he was feeling &#8220;blocked&#8221; and saying that with 35 km to go, he had already told directors that he was &#8220;not having a good day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, he brushed off the notion that he should be concerned about Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sunday will be a different race with a different run-up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That cannot be compared with this race.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Italian police conduct 25 searches in connection with Vini Zabù</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the heels of the Tuesday&#8217;s news that <strong>Vini Zabù</strong> rider <strong>Matteo De Bonis</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/vini-zabu-faces-a-potential-suspension-after-another-doping-positive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tested positive for EPO</a> in February, the <a href=\"https://corrierefiorentino.corriere.it/firenze/notizie/sport/21_marzo_30/doping-nas-vini-zabu-indagati-vertici-societa-ciclismo-1fd9d0f0-9185-11eb-9895-b0b176f6604a.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Corriere della Sera</a> reports that Italian police conducted 25 searches in connection with the Italian ProTeam yesterday.
