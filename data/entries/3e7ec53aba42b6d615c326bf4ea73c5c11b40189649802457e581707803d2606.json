It's best to install <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> and iPadOS 15 on a secondary <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> because this is early release software that could have issues.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOver the course of the iOS/‌iPadOS 15 testing period, Apple will be able to refine new features and work out bugs ahead of the software's release, which is expected in the fall. The June release will also allow developers to build new iOS and ‌iPadOS 15 features into their apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new beta software is limited to registered developers at this time, but Apple will provide a public beta for public beta testers later in the summer. Beta testing will last for several months ahead of the expected September release date of iOS and iPadOS 15. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-seeds-ios-15-beta-1-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS and iPadOS 15 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-and-ipados-15-to-developers.2299575/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Lk_QhSwCLRU:0lsoyeNmuqc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Lk_QhSwCLRU:0lsoyeNmuqc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Lk_QhSwCLRU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e7ec53aba42b6d615c326bf4ea73c5c11b40189649802457e581707803d2606","category":"Apple"}
