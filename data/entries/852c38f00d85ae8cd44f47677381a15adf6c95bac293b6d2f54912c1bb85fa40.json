{"title":"My Bike: Max Schachmann’s Specialized Tarmac SL7","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/my-bike-max-schachmanns-specialized-tarmac-sl7/","date":1615845177000,"content":"<p>Hands up if you had the privilege of watching Sunday&#8217;s final stage of Paris-Nice? If you missed it, well, you missed out on an absolute belter of a stage. Then again, you very well may have the excuse of being glued to stage five of Tirreno-Adriatico, which was equally nail-biting. All in all, it was a classy weekend of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris-Nice threw up a winner in a breathtaking final stage; it also delivered us the first back-to-back general classification victory since 2002. The winner was Bora-Hansgrohe&#8217;s Maximilian Schachmann, or Max to his mates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two days before Schachmann departed to defend his title, I managed to catch up with him. Yes, we spoke a bit about the upcoming race, but like all these videos in the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/my-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">My Bike</a> series, we stuck to what he&#8217;s riding. In this case, his team-issue Specialized Tarmac SL7.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-491472\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6727-2.jpg 1499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Halfway through the 2020 season, all of Specialized&#8217;s sponsored teams, including Boels–Dolmans, Deceuninck-QuickStep, and Bora-Hansgrohe, got their grubby mitts on the new updated model of the now all-round race bike. And by the sound of things, from what Max is saying, it wasn&#8217;t just the old Tarmac SL6s that were put out to pasture. The fleet of Specialized Venges, the brand&#8217;s pure aero bike, was too. The reason, as you may be aware, is that the SL7 gained a big dollop of aero gains, so much so that it kind of made the Venge redundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video above Max talks me through his bike, and as always, I got the freshly crowned double Paris-Nice champion to shoot his own bike, and I&#8217;ve got to say he&#8217;s pretty handy with the camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the pandemic interrupted a stellar season for Schachmann he still won Paris-Nice and had other notable results including a third place at a stiflingly hot Strade Bianche. He also used the &#8220;home time&#8221; that the pandemic offered to learn a few skills that he otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have had time to. Yep, with a new bike, no mechanics or bike shops on hand, Max turned to YouTube and learned how to bleed a disc brake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schachmann&#8217;s Tarmac is kitted out with a full Dura-Ace Di2 groupset. Gear ratios differ on his training bike and racing bike because, as we find out, he&#8217;s a fan of his knees! Wheels are from Roval and with a wide choice of tires on offer from Specialized, Schachmann opts for his preferred Turbo Cottons in 26 mm. To find out if he uses tubular, clinchers or tubs, well, I&#8217;m going to force you to watch the vid. You may be able to work it out as Max isn&#8217;t quite sure himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major change for the team, and one that seems quite a surprise, is that bars and stem this season are from Shimano&#8217;s in-house brand Pro. This is a big change from seasons past when the team used Specialized&#8217;s own and, for the most part, proprietary components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the team still sticks with Specialized saddles. For Max, well, he clearly has expensive taste, opting for the Power Mirror saddle – a $450 3D-printed perch. It&#8217;s lucky he doesn&#8217;t have to pay for it. I&#8217;ve got to admit that I can understand why he likes the saddle. As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/specialized-power-mirror-saddle-long-term-review/\">recent review</a> it&#8217;s quite possibly the comfiest place I&#8217;ve put my derriere while riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery__slider\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"491473\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=491473\" class=\"wp-image-491473\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6731.jpg 1499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"491470\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=491470\" class=\"wp-image-491470\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6736.jpg 1499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"491469\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=491469\" class=\"wp-image-491469\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6752.jpg 1499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"491466\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=491466\" class=\"wp-image-491466\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6854.jpg 1499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"491463\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=491463\" class=\"wp-image-491463\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DSC6880.jpg 1499w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chatting with Max in the lead-up to him defending his title at Paris-Nice was a privilege. I&#8217;m sure he could have used his time more constructively. So, I&#8217;d like to say a big thanks to the now double Race to the Sun winner for his time.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/my-bike-max-schachmanns-specialized-tarmac-sl7/\">My Bike: Max Schachmann&#8217;s Specialized Tarmac SL7</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"852c38f00d85ae8cd44f47677381a15adf6c95bac293b6d2f54912c1bb85fa40","category":"Cycling"}
