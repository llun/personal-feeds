{"title":"Some M1 iMac Models Shipping With Crooked Mountings","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/m1-imac-crooked-mountings/","date":1623700208000,"content":"Some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> iMacs appear to have a manufacturing defect that causes the display to be mounted on the stand in a way that's not perfectly aligned, leading to a crooked display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/m1-imac-back.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYouTuber iPhonedo over the weekend published a review of the ‌M1‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, and he found that his machine appeared to be tilted on one side, a mounting disparity that was visibly noticeable and proved with a ruler.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAnother person on the Apple Support Communities <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252834820\">also complained</a> of a non-level display with a 1mm disparity between the right and the left sides of the display, and there was a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/nzty91/some_imacs_are_shipping_crooked/\">third complaint on Reddit</a>, with the person in that situation discovering the issue after watching iPhonedo's video.<blockquote>Checked mine after watching this and it's also crooked.\r\n<br />\r\nNot to the degree of his, but not completely level either.\r\n<br />\r\nI'm outside of my return window and I can't take the time hit of not having a machine to work on for a month, but super disappointing that Apple of all companies is shipping units with such a glaring oversight.</blockquote>Even our own orange ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌ that we ordered for testing appears to have a slightly crooked display. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan had noticed the ‌iMac‌ was crooked and assumed it was a problem with his desk, but it appears that may not be the case. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are seven screws holding the ‌iMac‌'s display to the mount, and the manufacturing issue does not appear to be user fixable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple may opt to allow returns of crooked iMacs after the two week return window, but it appears to be a problem that's limited in scale at this time so we don't yet know how support staff will respond. Apple customers who purchase a new ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌ should check for a crooked display right when receiving a new machine so that it can be returned or swapped out within its two week return window to avoid having to try to get support from Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo far there are only a handful of known iMacs with this manufacturing issue, but let us know in the comments below if you've had issues with the mounting on your ‌M1‌ ‌iMac‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/m1-imac-crooked-mountings/\">Some M1 iMac Models Shipping With Crooked Mountings</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-m1-imac-models-shipping-with-crooked-mountings.2300906/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MvsXuHRX7tM:zwdInK3l7zk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MvsXuHRX7tM:zwdInK3l7zk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MvsXuHRX7tM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"056434d305b9b3f443a3625fce7f967288359830efe270dcfb55a46e7458ac03","category":"Apple"}
