If you’d like to read more about this exciting partnership, <a href=\"https://grafana.com/blog/2020/12/15/announcing-amazon-managed-service-for-grafana/?pg=hp&amp;plcmt=hero-btn1\">check out this blog</a> by Grafana Lab’s CEO, Raj Dutt.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana</a> is one of the most popular open source technologies used to create observability dashboards for your applications. It has a pluggable data source model and support for different kinds of time series databases and cloud monitoring vendors. Grafana centralizes your application data from multiple open-source, cloud, and third-party data sources.</p> \n<p>Many of our customers love Grafana, but don’t want the burden of self-hosting and managing it. <span title=\"\">AMG</span> manages the provisioning, setup, scaling, version upgrades and security patching of Grafana, eliminating the need for customers to do it themselves. <span title=\"\">AMG</span> automatically scales to support thousands of users with high availability.</p> \n<p>With <span title=\"\">AMG</span>, you will get a fully managed and secure data visualization service where you can query, correlate, and visualize operational metrics, logs and traces across multiple data sources including cloud services such as AWS, Google, and Microsoft. <span title=\"\">AMG</span> is integrated with AWS data sources, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\" title=\"\">Amazon CloudWatch</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/\" title=\"\">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/x-ray/\" title=\"\">AWS X-Ray</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/\" title=\"\">AWS IoT SiteWise</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/\" title=\"\">Amazon Timestream</a>, and others to collect operational data in a simple way. <span title=\"\">AMG</span>&nbsp;is also tightly integrated with the newly announced <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/\" title=\"\">Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)</a>, providing customers a comprehensive observability solution for container based applications. Additionally, <span title=\"\">AMG</span> also provides plug-ins to connect to popular third-party data sources, such as <a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/\">Datadog</a>, <a href=\"https://www.splunk.com/\">Splunk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\">ServiceNow</a>, and <a href=\"https://newrelic.com/\">New Relic</a> by upgrading to Grafana Enterprise directly from the AWS Console.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/08/01_creating_grafana2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-45407 size-large\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/08/01_creating_grafana2-939x1024.png\" alt=\"Screenshot for creating and configuring a managed Grafana workspace\" width=\"939\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p><span title=\"\">AMG</span> integrates directly into your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/\" title=\"\">AWS Organizations</a>. You can define a <span title=\"\">AMG</span> workspace in one AWS account that allows you to discover and access datasources in all your accounts and regions across your AWS organization. Creating dashboards in Grafana is easy as all these different datasources are discoverable in one place.</p> \n<p>Customers really like Grafana for the ease of creating dashboards, it comes with many built-in dashboards to use when you add a new data source, or you can take advantage of its broad community of pre-built dashboards. For example, you can see in the following image a really nice dashboard that <span title=\"\">AMG</span> created for me from one of my <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" title=\"\">AWS Lambda</a> function.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/14/lambda-automatic.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-45848 size-large\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/12/14/lambda-automatic-834x1024.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of an automatic dashboard for Lambda function\" width=\"834\" height=\"1024\" /></a></p> \n<p>One of my favorite things from <span title=\"\">AMG</span> is the built-in security features. You can easily enable single sign-on using AWS Single Sign-On, restrict access to data sources and dashboards to the right users, and access audit logs via <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\" title=\"\">AWS CloudTrail</a> for your hosted Grafana workspace. With AWS Single Sign-On you can leverage your existing corporate directories to enforce authentication and authorization permissions.</p> \n<p>Another powerful feature that <span title=\"\">AMG</span> has is support for Alerts. <span title=\"\">AMG</span> integrates with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\" title=\"\">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> so customers can send Grafana alerts to <span title=\"\">SNS</span> as a notification destination. It also has support for four other alert destinations including <a href=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/\">PagerDuty</a>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://victorops.com/\">VictorOps</a> and <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie\">OpsGenie</a>.</p> \n<p>There are no up-front investments required to use <span title=\"\">AMG</span>, and you only pay a monthly active user license fee. This means that you can provision many users to access to your Grafana workspace, but will only be billed for active users that log in and use the workspace that month. Users granted access but that do not log in, will not be billed that month. You can also upgrade to <a href=\"http://grafana.com/products/aws-enterprise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grafana Enterprise</a> using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/\" title=\"\">AWS Marketplace</a>, to get access to enterprise plugins, support, and training content directly from Grafana Labs.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Availability</span></strong></p> \n<p>This service is available in <span title=\"\">US East (N.
