Reporters at BuzzFeed News obtained the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/full-facebook-stop-the-steal-internal-report\">report</a>, titled “Stop the Steal and Patriot Party: The Growth and Mitigation of an Adversarial Harmful Movement” and published the document today after Facebook reportedly began restricting employees’ access to it.</p>\n<p>The social media company was apparently unprepared for the idea that people would use their own accounts to spread misinformation and calls for violence and other antidemocratic behavior. Among the conclusions, Facebook acknowledged that, while it had prepared tools to combat “inauthentic behavior,” which might include provocations from a fake account run by Russian intelligence operatives, for example, the company was woefully unprepared to confront “coordinated <em>authentic</em> harm.” (Emphasis Facebook’s.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760154#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760154&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d6f928387ba5f5cc1b73519afc0977b26048e13c90a511b74c3748da47a5593","category":"Tech"}
