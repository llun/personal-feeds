It has everything: suspended laptop compartment that fits most 13-inch laptops, rolling luggage pass-through, ultra-comfortable edgeless shoulder straps, and full clamshell opening. Tom Bihn bags are all cut and sewn in Seattle, and come with a lifetime guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>love</em> Tom Bihn’s bags. I bought one over a decade ago for my beloved 11-inch MacBook Air, traveled on dozens of flights with it, and now it’s still a perfect-sized bag for going places with an 11-inch iPad. And the bag looks brand-new. Tom Bihn’s bags are just the best stuff.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Tom Bihn’s Synik 22’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/05/tom-bihn\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9f2b8642a0e5e3f5edb2b0b1231f790335c70b1e565512508dde0208511327ff","category":"Tech"}
