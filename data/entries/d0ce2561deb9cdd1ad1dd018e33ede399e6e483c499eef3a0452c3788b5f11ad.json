After <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334315/apple-discontinues-imac-pro-as-signs-point-to-imminent-m1-launch.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334315/apple-discontinues-imac-pro-as-signs-point-to-imminent-m1-launch.html\">retiring the iMac Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/imac-configurations-3802921/\">discontinuing some higher-end storage configurations of the iMac 4K</a>, the latest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/macos-big-sur-release-date-3779573/\">macOS Big Sur 11.3 beta</a> contains some clues that new models might be landing very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/23/new-apple-silicon-imacs-referenced-in-latest-macos-big-sur-11-3-beta/&amp;xcust=1-1-340440-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported by 9to5Mac</a>, the fifth Big Sur 11.3 beta that landed this week contains references to iMac21,1 and iMac21,2 code identifiers that haven&rsquo;t been seen before. 9to5Mac says they match the Apple silicon codenames previously reported by Bloomberg, though there&rsquo;s nothing out of the ordinary about the numbering. Last year&rsquo;s iMac refreshes were <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634&amp;xcust=1-1-340440-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">labeled iMac20,1,&nbsp;iMac20,2</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it still points to a possibly imminent release. While the existence of the identifiers doesn&rsquo;t <em>necessarily</em> mean new iMacs are around the corner, it certainly lends some more fuel to that particular fire. A new iMac form factor has been rumored for more than a year, bringing a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234277/pro-display-xdr-inspired-imac-redesign-for-wwdc-teased-by-noted-apple-leaker.html\">Pro XDR Display-inspired redesign</a> that shrinks the bezels and eliminates the chin, and it stands to reason that the next Apple silicon-based Mac will be the iMac. New MacBooks are seemingly slated for the second half of 2021 and the Mac Pro isn&rsquo;t rumored to arrive until 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been nearly 10 years since the iMac received its thin-edge design and another eight before it had its last major redesign. The current iMac form factor is basically a variation of the iMac G5 that replaced the iconic iMac G4 in 2004.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"How to use Sticky and Slow Keys in macOS to make you a better typist","siteHash":"a7879ba5f180a82d66aec288ff9d7878ee4e9167517300eaf1008def9c1281a2","entryHash":"d0ce2561deb9cdd1ad1dd018e33ede399e6e483c499eef3a0452c3788b5f11ad","category":"Apple"}
