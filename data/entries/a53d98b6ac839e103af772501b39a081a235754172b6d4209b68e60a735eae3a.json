Paintings adorn the walls of at least 300 sites in the karst hills of Maros-Pangkep, with more almost certainly waiting to be rediscovered. But archaeologists say humanity's oldest art is crumbling before their very eyes.</p>\n<p>\"We have recorded rapid loss of hand-sized spall flakes from these ancient art panels over a single season (less than five months),\" said archaeologist Rustan Lebe of Makassar's culture heritage department.</p>\n<h2>Erasing history</h2>\n<p>The culprit is salt. As water flows through a limestone cave system, it carries minerals from the local bedrock, and the minerals eventually end up in the limestone. At the limestone's surface, those minerals oxidize into a case-hardened rocky crust. Nearly all of the oldest rock art in Maros-Pangkep—like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/this-painted-pig-is-the-worlds-oldest-figurative-art/\">the oldest drawing in the world</a> that depicts an actual object—is painted in red or mulberry-purple pigment on that hard outer layer. The rock is resistant to most weathering, providing a durable canvas for humanity's oldest artwork.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765735#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765735&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
