You can build an entire career around nothing but this topic—making you a DB admin, not a humble sysadmin like yours truly—but for today, we're just going to cover the basics.</p>\n<p>For this guide, we're going to be using Ubuntu Linux as the underlying operating system—but <em>most</em> of these steps and tips will be either the same, or broadly similar, across nearly any OS or distribution you might install MySQL on.</p>\n<h2>Installing MySQL</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/install-mysql-server.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          If you're even vaguely familiar with Ubuntu or Debian, the installation process shouldn't be surprising: <strong>apt install mysql-server</strong> and you're off to the races.
