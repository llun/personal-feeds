Long story short, it's now much more powerful, enough to make Xbox's $15/month Game Pass Ultimate an increasingly attractive subscription option.</p>\n<p>Xbox Game Streaming, which was previously known as Project xCloud, works much like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/18-months-after-launch-google-stadia-now-supports-android-tv/\">Google Stadia</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-impressions-more-than-good-enough-for-5-99-mo/\">Amazon Luna</a>, and other cloud-streaming options. Pick a game, and a server farm will spin up a personal instance and beam its gameplay video to your preferred, Internet-connected device while tracking your local button taps. The concept is a downgrade from locally owned hardware for a few reasons, including button-tap latency and hits to any ISP bandwidth caps, but it's also arguably easier for some households than buying a new console.</p>\n<p>The Xbox version has been quite attractive thanks to its value proposition.;\" Ince it includes over 260 games as part of a $15/month subscription, as opposed to a smaller Luna library, \"a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/weeks-after-launch-nvidias-geforce-now-attracts-a-million-streaming-gamers/\"&gt;service-compatibility issues with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/weeks-after-launch-nvidias-geforce-now-attracts-a-million-streaming-gamers/\">Nvidia GeForce Now</a>, and the a la carte pricing universe of Stadia. (Game Pass also comes in $10/month flavors, meant specifically for local hardware.) Up until now, however, the catch has been measly power on the server-farm side, since its cloud instances regressed to the \"base\" Xbox One console spec. Earlier this month, Xbox execs confirmed that its server fleet would begin upgrading to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/xbox-series-x-s-review-beautiful-powerful-but-whatcha-gonna-play/\">Xbox Series X</a> spec, which supports higher frame rates, higher pixel resolutions, faster loading times, and advanced rendering features.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775411#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775411&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa9b3e57780567e4c8fac134fda3c2a6765d8abaab1ba89ec17d79d68bdce797","category":"Tech"}
