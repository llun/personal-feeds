Founded four years ago, Voyage is working to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/how-startups-are-building-driverless-cars-without-googles-billions/\">launch a self-driving taxi service</a> at the Villages, a massive retirement community in Florida.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg says that \"no deal is imminent,\" and I don't have any inside information. But such a deal would be consistent with an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/07/slow-progress-on-self-driving-is-putting-startups-in-a-bind/\">ongoing trend</a>: it's becoming harder and harder for self-driving startups to remain independent.</p>\n<p>Voyage was part of a wave of self-driving startups that were founded between 2013 and 2018.
