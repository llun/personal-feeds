The data that Apple has collected will improve voice recognition systems for atypical speech patterns, according to an Apple spokesperson.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlong with improving how &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; understands people with atypical speech patterns, Apple has also implemented a Hold to Talk feature for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that allows users to control how long they want &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to listen for. This prevents &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; from interrupting users with a stutter before they're finished speaking.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can also be used without voice all together, through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/type-to-siri-ios/\">a Type to Siri feature</a> that was first introduced in iOS 11.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple plans to outline its work to improve &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in a research paper set to be published this week, which will provide more details on the company's efforts.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle and Amazon are also working to train Google Assistant and Alexa to better understand all users, including those who have trouble using their voices. Google is collecting atypical speech data, and Amazon in December launched the Alexa Fund to let people who have speech impairments train an algorithm to recognize their unique vocal patterns.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/apple-siri-atypical-speech-improvements/\">Apple Training Siri to Better Understand People With Atypical Speech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-training-siri-to-better-understand-people-with-atypical-speech.2286231/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8Fe5yTGHi-A:906Mmb_3P6U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8Fe5yTGHi-A:906Mmb_3P6U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8Fe5yTGHi-A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5ac1d765f94d64568f382f73e94842ecb5db87d0395b152f59fc8c25c97fc70c","category":"Apple"}
