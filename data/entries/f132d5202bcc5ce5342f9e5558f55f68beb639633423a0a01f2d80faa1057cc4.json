{"title":"Apple Launches Podcasts Subscriptions","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-launches-podcasts-subscriptions/","date":1623743531000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launching-on-june-15/\">As expected</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a> has officially rolled out Apple Podcast Subscriptions, offering content creators and podcasters an opportunity to receive support through monthly subscriptions from their fans and listeners.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/apple-podcasts-subcirptions.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple announced the new service during its April event and ultimately had planned to launch it soon after. The company, however, then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/apple-delays-podcasts-subscriptions-launch/\">decided to delay its launch</a> to ensure that the \"best experience\" is being given. Now, listeners can decide to subscribe to a monthly subscription for their favorite show, and by doing so, receive an ad-free listening experience with bonus content.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll subscriptions made through the platform are subject to Apple's 30% commission rule, meaning creators only get 70% of the subscriptions that users pay. Additionally, if users subscribe to a podcast but wish to use a thrid party podcast client, the benefits of the purchase are not accessible. Apple Podcast Subscriptions also include the ability for podcast creators and users to create Channels, which are a collection of different shows on a single page.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts-subscriptions/\">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-launches-podcasts-subscriptions/\">Apple Launches Podcasts Subscriptions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-podcasts-subscriptions.2300962/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=D3vCPByycpE:oPv6pIq0Ip8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=D3vCPByycpE:oPv6pIq0Ip8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/D3vCPByycpE\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f132d5202bcc5ce5342f9e5558f55f68beb639633423a0a01f2d80faa1057cc4","category":"Apple"}
