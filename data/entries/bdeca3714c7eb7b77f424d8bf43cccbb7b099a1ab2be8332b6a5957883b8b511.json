The air-sprung shock is available in metric-only sizing, however.</p>\n<p>Its coil-sprung counterpart, the DHX also features the same adjustments and lockout lever and is only available in metric sizes, too.</p>\n<p>Both shocks sit alongside the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/rear-shocks/fox-float-dpx2-factory-evol-rear-shock-review/\">DPX2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/rear-shocks/fox-float-x2-rear-shock-review/\">Float X2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/fox-2021-suspension/\">DHX2</a> stablemates, and prices start at £569 / $499 / €699, rising to £659 / $569 / €799.</p>\n<h2>2022 Fox Float X rear shock details and specifications</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pictured is the eyelet mount version of the Float X.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox Suspension</i></span></div>\n<p>Fox touts the Float X as a thinned-down, lighter version of its DPX2 and will be sold alongside its bigger sibling.</p>\n<p>Its high-volume air spring is tuneable with volume spacers in 0.1in cubed increments. Tuning the spring rate with spacers changes how progressive the spring rate is; the more spacers the more progressive it will be.</p>\n<p>Fox claims that it requires 40psi less spring air pressure for the same sag levels compared to the DPX2, thanks to its high volume air can.</p>\n<p>The Float X is available in metric stroke and eye-to-eye sizes only, and there are trunnion-mounted options, too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Float X has low-speed compression and rebound adjustment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox Suspension</i></span></div>\n<p>The external low-speed compression adjuster has 12 clicks of adjustment, while Fox says the rebound adjuster has increased range over the DPX2. There’s also a two-position firm mode which is essentially a lockout lever.</p>\n<p>It has a hydraulic top-out function, while there’s a progressive MCU bottom-out bumper to reduce the chance of harsh bottoming.</p>\n<p>The shock’s piggyback lengths change with its stroke. For shocks with more travel, more oil is displaced and therefore a larger reservoir is needed.</p>\n<p>The 2022 Float X is available in Factory and Performance Elite specifications.</p>\n<h2>2022 Fox DHX rear shock details and specifications</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The DHX uses Fox’s coil springs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox Suspension</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2022 Fox DHX shares most of its features with the Float X. The most notable difference is, of course, its coil spring (instead of air) and different-looking body and piston.</p>\n<p>Other extras include detents on the spring collar so it’s easier to count how many turns of preload are applied, a spring scuff guard on the shock’s body (as the spring compresses it can ‘banana’ and scrape the shock) and a spring retainer identical to the one used on the DHX2.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The external low-speed rebound has 11 clicks of adjustment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox Suspension</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2022 Fox DHX is only available in Factory specification.</p>\n<h2>2022 Fox Float X and Fox DHX rear shock models and prices</h2>\n<p>Across the Float X and DHX range, three models are available with prices ranging from £569 / $499 / €699 to £659 / $569 / €799.</p>\n<h3>2022 Fox Float X Factory</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 2022 Fox Float X Factory.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox Suspension</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes standard eyelet (mm)</strong>: 190×45 / 210×50 / 210×55 / 230×57.5 / 230×65</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes trunnion eyelet (mm)</strong>: 185×52.5 / 185×55 / 205×60 / 205×62.5</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustment</strong>: Two-position open/firm lever.
