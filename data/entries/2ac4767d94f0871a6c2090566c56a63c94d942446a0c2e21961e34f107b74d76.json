{"title":"Review: Warmly satirical Werewolves Within is comic horror with a heart","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778113","date":1625421290000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p><em>Veep</em>'s Sam Richardson stars as park ranger Finn Wheeler in the comedy/horror/whodunnit <em>Werewolves Within</em>. </p></div>\n<p>After so many years of zombies dominating the horror genre, it's nice to see the classic werewolf making a comeback. Last year's sleeper indie film  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Snow_Hollow\"><em>The Wolf of Snow Hollow</em></a> was a wry, clever take that mixed elements of <em>Fargo</em>, <em>Scooby-Doo,</em> and the lesser-known 1981 film<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfen_(film)\">Wolfen</a></em>. And now we have the horror comedy (emphasis on the comedy) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_Within_(film)\"><em>Werewolves Within</em></a>, loosely based on the Ubisoft multiplayer VR game of the same name. I'm happy to report that the film is a worthy successor to the <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=goat\">GOAT</a> of the genre: 1981's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_London\"><em>An American Werewolf in London</em></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some minor spoilers below but no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p>This is only the second feature film from Director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2063694/\">Josh Ruben</a>, who cut his teeth making viral video shorts for College Humor. His first feature was last year's winsome <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/monster-mash-these-are-the-best-new-horror-movies-to-binge-this-halloween/\"><em>Scare Me</em></a>, about two writers holed up in a remote Catskills cabin who compete over who can tell the scariest story. Ruben, who is also an actor, wrote and co-starred in that film (opposite Aya Cash, whose portrayal of Stormfront was a highlight of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/review-dont-call-it-a-comeback-the-boys-returns-better-than-ever-in-s2/\"><em>The Boys</em> S2</a>). <em>Scare Me</em> earned positive reviews for its witty script and creative camera work, among other strengths. So when Ubisoft was looking for a director for its film adaptation of <em>Werewolves Within</em>, Ruben seemed an obvious choice.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778113#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778113&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2ac4767d94f0871a6c2090566c56a63c94d942446a0c2e21961e34f107b74d76","category":"Tech"}
