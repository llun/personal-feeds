Now <a href=\"https://news.voyage.auto/voyage-acquired-by-cruise-d5f76011032f\">it's official</a>: Cruise is acquiring Voyage.</p>\n<p>Voyage's strategy was to launch its first self-driving taxi service at the Villages, a massive retirement community in Florida. The Villages is large enough that people need a car to get around, yet many of its residents are at or near the age where they can't drive safely. The community had a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, reducing the risk that anyone would be killed if a self-driving car malfunctioned.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/googles-waymo-risks-repeating-silicon-valleys-most-famous-blunder/\">piece</a> two years ago, I suggested that focusing on a relatively easy application of self-driving technology like this could allow a startup like Voyage to succeed while their larger rivals floundered. I argued that once a company like Voyage has a viable commercial service in a limited area, expanding over time to a larger area and higher speeds would be relatively easy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750110#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750110&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
