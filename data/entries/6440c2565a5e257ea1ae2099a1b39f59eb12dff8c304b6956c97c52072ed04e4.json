Originally meant to debut at the 2020 SXSW festival, with a May 2020 theatrical release, the film was shelved in the face of the global pandemic. With theaters slowly reopening around the country (and the world), <em>The Green Knight</em> is finally being released this summer.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for the 14th-century medieval poem below.)</strong></p>\n<p>The original poem falls into the chivalric romance genre, relating a well-known story from Arthurian legend. (I highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345277600/?tag=arstech20-20\">J.R.R. Tolkien's translation</a> from 1925 or Simon Armitage's 2008 translation, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0571340164/?tag=arstech20-20\">recently revised</a>.) On New Year's Day, King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table gather at Camelot to feast and exchange gifts. A mysterious Green Knight disrupts the festivities and proposes a different kind of exchange: any one of the knights may strike him with one blow with his axe; in return, the Green Knight will come back in a year to return the blow. Sir Gawain, the youngest of the knights and nephew to Arthur, accepts the challenge and beheads the Green Knight. Everyone is shocked when the Green Knight picks up his severed head. He says Gawain must meet him at the Green Chapel one year hence to receive a similar blow, per their bargain.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764204#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764204&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6440c2565a5e257ea1ae2099a1b39f59eb12dff8c304b6956c97c52072ed04e4","category":"Tech"}
