The feature delays charging the battery past 80% when it predicts the user will be connected to power for an extended period of time, and aims to charge the battery before they unplug from power, according to Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOptimized Battery Charging can be toggled on or off in System Preferences > Battery > Battery on both Intel-based and M1-based Macs, but there are certain other battery health management features that cannot be disabled on M1-based Macs.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/macos-11-3-optimized-battery-charging-meetings/\">macOS 11.3 Could Ensure Your Mac is Fully Charged in Time for Calendar Events</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-11-3-could-ensure-your-mac-is-fully-charged-in-time-for-calendar-events.2285224/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VG0yiiAHNNE:mrFPfjf-Fq4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VG0yiiAHNNE:mrFPfjf-Fq4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VG0yiiAHNNE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88643a341027fa97a3a77e417cf9bca9df89dbe81807f54f2eb1c49f30e01406","category":"Apple"}
