The trial’s Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) sent a highly unusual letter to AstraZeneca soon after the Monday press release, noting that trial data it had seen during February and March meetings suggested that the vaccine’s efficacy was actually between 69 percent and 74 percent.</p>\n<p>“The DSMB is concerned that AstraZeneca chose to use data that was already outdated and potentially misleading in their press release,” the letter stated. “The point that is clear to the board is that the [vaccine efficacy number]... they chose to release was the most favorable for the study as opposed to the most recent and most complete. Decisions like this are what erode public trust in the scientific process.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752082#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752082&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a2ae5d3cf45e04179299840e11f2d9cd95bb5e1bb80e22fc4f8b0bae07a9561","category":"Tech"}
