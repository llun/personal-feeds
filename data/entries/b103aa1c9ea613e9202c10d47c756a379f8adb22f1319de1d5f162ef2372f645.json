The pair makes a hell of a problem-solving team, jazz hands and fist bumps and all.</p>\n<p>    </p><div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <div>\n                            <div>\n                                                                <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/91Bd7P8UwxL-300x453.jpg\" /></div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3><em>Project Hail Mary</em>                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <ul><li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hZlXPu\" target=\"_blank\">$17 at Amazon</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fproject-hail-mary-by-andy-weir-hardcover%2F-%2FA-81193200&amp;subid1=ArsPHMReview\" target=\"_blank\">$17 at Target</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                    </ul></div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\nBut the relative ease with which Grace and Rocky understand each other got me thinking about the real-world issues that might arise when two beings from vastly different evolutionary backgrounds try to communicate. <em>PHM</em>'s otherwise solid commitment to science leans a bit here on what we might call the \"anthropic principle of science fiction,\" after the more well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle\">general anthropic principle</a>. To wit: Rocky and Grace can communicate well with each other because it serves the story, and if they couldn't, the book would be shorter and less interesting.\n<p>I get it—<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3407971-see-the-turtle-ain-t-he-keen-all-things-serve-the\">that's how storytelling works.</a> I don't want to sound like a bitter basement-dwelling critic throwing shade at a bestselling science fiction author. But <em>PHM</em> is like <em>The Martian</em> in that it's about solving problems <em>realistically.</em> From my nerd basement throne, it feels like the softer sciences of linguistics and anthropology (or perhaps xenolinguistics and xenoanthropology) don't get the same stage time as their more STEM-y counterparts like physics and relativity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767514#p3\">Read 59 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767514&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b103aa1c9ea613e9202c10d47c756a379f8adb22f1319de1d5f162ef2372f645","category":"Tech"}
