Comcast's 56 percent increase in upstream traffic made me wonder if the company will increase upload speeds any time soon, so I checked out the Xfinity website today to see the current upload speeds. Getting that information was even more difficult than I expected.</p>\n<p>The Xfinity website advertises cable-Internet plans with download speeds starting at 25Mbps without mentioning that upstream speeds are just a fraction of the downstream ones. I went through Comcast's online ordering system today and found no mention of upload speeds anywhere. Even clicking \"pricing &amp; other info\" and \"view plan details\" links to read the fine print on various Internet plans didn't reveal upload speeds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746817#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746817&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"84ff6fda7100810f10532d2cfb762a21028045de7fb320b57b6dd164d9292a37","category":"Tech"}
