On an almost daily basis, current NASA astronauts take T-38s out for flights to hone their flying skills,or to jet across the country for mission training. A few hundred meters away from the main runway, Intuitive Machines is testing rocket engines to support lunar landings.</p>\n<p>Crain is the chief technology officer for Houston-based Intuitive Machines, which is building landers to take cargo to the lunar surface. Intuitive Machines has a mixture of NASA and commercial contracts and has emerged as one of a new generation of mostly small companies seeking to extend the sphere of economic activity to the lunar surface.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761248#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761248&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5dc302ceb16650f26f137ce18e73067fc8465e1ad6530b9561bcaebeb1bbff39","category":"Tech"}
