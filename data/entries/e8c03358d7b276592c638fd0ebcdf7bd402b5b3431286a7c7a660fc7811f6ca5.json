This booster has truly become the workhorse of the global launch industry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After learning to crawl, walk and run, the Falcon 9 is now sprinting. Today:</p>\n<p>• 100th consecutive, successful launch of a Falcon 9</p>\n<p>• 16th launch of 2021, a cadence of one rocket every nine days</p>\n<p>• 6th launch during the last 33 days, once every five days <a href=\"https://t.co/kmuBJwA82i\">pic.twitter.com/kmuBJwA82i</a></p>\n<p>— Eric Berger (@SciGuySpace) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1397630987832643586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Original post</strong>: SpaceX will attempt to launch another batch of 60 Starlink satellites today at 2:59 pm ET (18:59 UTC) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This marks the 28th overall launch of operational Starlink satellites.</p>\n<p>The most notable aspect of today's mission is that it would be the 100th consecutive successful flight for the Falcon 9 rocket. This record dates back to June 2015, when the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage failed during the launch of a cargo supply mission to the International Space Station. The Dragon capsule was lost after the second stage broke apart and sank into the Atlantic Ocean.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767674#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767674&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8c03358d7b276592c638fd0ebcdf7bd402b5b3431286a7c7a660fc7811f6ca5","category":"Tech"}
