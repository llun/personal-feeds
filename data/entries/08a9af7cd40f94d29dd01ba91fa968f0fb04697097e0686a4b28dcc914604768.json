Play Store listings will also outline whether apps employ security practices like data encryption, if Google's Families policy is followed, if the data sharing details have been verified by an independent third party, and if an app allows users to request data deletion.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with Apple's App Privacy labels, Google Play developers must self-report information, and Google will introduce a policy that requires developers to provide accurate details. If a developer violates this policy, Google will \"require the developer to fix it\" and there could be \"policy enforcement\" consequences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle plans to share additional policy requirements and resources this summer, and all Play Store apps will be required to provide this information starting in the second quarter of 2022.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-play/\">Google Play</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/google-play-store-privacy-labels/\">Google Plans to Add Privacy Labels to Play Store Apps Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-plans-to-add-privacy-labels-to-play-store-apps-next-year.2295105/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zom6foJTN3c:uHRAEF0nYMI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zom6foJTN3c:uHRAEF0nYMI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zom6foJTN3c\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"08a9af7cd40f94d29dd01ba91fa968f0fb04697097e0686a4b28dcc914604768","category":"Apple"}
