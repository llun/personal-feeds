The plant will be run as a subsidiary of Porsche in a joint venture with Customcells and will develop <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/eternally-five-years-away-no-batteries-are-improving-under-your-nose/\">cells that use silicon as opposed to graphite</a> for the anode material.</p>\n<p>\"We already started within research and pre-development to build up know how and knowledge about cell chemistry, and the company Cellforce Group will have around 60 engineers in development and about 20 in production; the main focus, at least in the beginning, is to take care about the development of the cell and cell chemistry,\" said Michael Steiner, member of the executive board, R&amp;D at Porsche.</p>\n<p>But unlike other <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/volkswagen-group-wants-six-new-european-battery-by-2030/\">recent battery factory announcements</a>, the goal for Cellforce is high performance, not high volume.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774776#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774776&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
