Shortly after entering the atmosphere, an infrared camera aboard a WB-57 aircraft was able to track the vehicle as it glided down to the surface. Sea states were remarkably calm as the vehicle, which resembled a toasted marshmallow following its rigorous reentry through Earth's atmosphere, wasÂ hoisted aboard the <em>GO Navigator</em> recovery boat.</p>\n\n<p>Inside, NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Vic Glover, and Shannon Walker, along with Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi, were healthy and happy after spending nearly six months living aboard the International Space Station and feeling the effects of Earth's gravity again.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761816#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761816&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7a64cf97edc98d3c30a8708372418cb1c0e9a759dd1fab9b058f73762a6113c7","category":"Tech"}
