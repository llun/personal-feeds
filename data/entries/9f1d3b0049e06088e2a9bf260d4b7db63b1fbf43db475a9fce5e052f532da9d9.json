href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a> and wide rims for some time.</p>\n<p>The 4 Season Gravel Disc X-Wide is a reasonably affordable aluminium wheelset aimed at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-gravel-bike/\">gravel</a>, with an internal rim width of 25mm that’s ideal for tyres from 35mm to 50mm wide.</p>\n<p>The rims use Hunt’s H_Lock inner profile, the brand’s name for the pronounced bead humps that help prevent untimely dismounting of a tubeless tyre when it’s subjected to side loads, and makes riding at the lower pressures demanded by gravel safer.</p>\n<p>The rims have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hooks</a> so can be used with standard clinchers too, although it’s interesting to note how minimal these are.</p>\n<p>As with other Hunt wheels, the Gravel Disc X-Wides are available in all major axle standards and a choice of Shimano freehubs or SRAM drivers.</p>\n<p>Hunt uses asymmetric rims for more even left-right spoke tension balance, and laces them with Pillar spokes secured using corrosion-resistant brass nipples.</p>\n<p>The complete set with end caps for 12mm axles front and rear weighs 1,653g on our scales, including rotor lock rings, cassette spacer, tubeless valves and tape.</p>\n<ul><li>£359</li>\n<li><a

Fear not because RockShox’sDomain is a (slightly) more affordable option.</p>\n<p>It has those chunky stanchions that mean when you barrel into a rock garden your fork should be as stiff as any non-DH fork out there, but to save cash, its materials, damper and air spring are a little less ‘fancy’ than its top-spec counterparts.</p>\n<p>Instead of a Charger damper you get a Motion Control RC damper, which can be upgraded to a Charger down the line for a few hundred quid.</p>\n<p>OEM forks (i.e. the ones that come on a stock bike) might have a yet cheaper Motion Control R fork. If it’s got an R at the end of the name you get rebound control, if it’s RC you get rebound and compression.</p>\n<p>The DebonAir Spring is present, but it’s not quite the same as the one in the ZEB, so this can’t be upgraded – that’s because the internal space on the air side is different, thanks to the use of cheaper alloys.</p>\n<p>Aside from this, you get 150 to 180mm of travel in both wheel sizes, a short 44mm offset, 2.8in tyre clearance and a (claimed) weight a touch over 2.5kg.

Really, it’s a thing.</p>\n<p>The matching bib shorts are made from more conventional sounding synthetics and are designed to give a “super compressive race fit”.</p>\n<p>They feel almost papery in the hand and feature a substantial foam chamois. As is typical of high-end shorts, the legs are cuffless, with a laser-cut edge and tiny silicone dots on the inside to add grip.</p>\n<p>Ashmei’s Merino arm warmers are made from the same material as the jersey and they roll up to a tiny ball you likely wouldn’t notice in a back pocket.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Signature Merino jersey:</strong> Men’s £128 / Women’s £126</li>\n<li><strong>Signature bib shorts:</strong> Men’s £194 / Women’s £176</li>\n<li><strong>Merino arm warmers:</strong> £44</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ashmei.com\">Buy now from Ashmei</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Q36.5 Unique shoes</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Hunt-Q36.5-11-6927347.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Unique shoes are packed with features. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Hunt-Q36.5-10-63d1e4d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>A tongueless design aims for a sock-like fit.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Hunt-Q36.5-13-6ccaaed.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The soles are super-stiff carbon.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Q36.5 is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/meet-q36-5-fresh-high-end-road-gear-from-an-assos-veteran/\">former Assos R&amp;D director Luigi Bergamo’s brand</a> and the Unique is claimed to be the first “body-mapped” cycling shoe for the road, aiming to offer comfort, support and performance.</p>\n<p>Like other premium shoes – the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-s-works-ares/\">Specialized Ares</a> is one – the Unique uses a tongueless construction that’s meant to offer a sock-like fit. This is achieved by stitching a wraparound elasticated section inside a one-piece microfibre upper.</p>\n<p>Hidden inside the shoe, a “Power Wrap Support” runs round the mid-foot including the Boa dials, to help with power transfer.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the included footbed is said to reduce pressure on the foot and even outperform custom orthotics – quite a claim.</p>\n<p>It almost goes without saying, but the outsole is all-carbon. It features an unusual three-dimensional design that mimics a vertebral column.</p>\n<p>All this comes at a hefty price tag of course, although recent shoe launches have all but inured us to sticker shock.</p>\n<ul><li>€424 / £399</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/shop/cycling-shoes/unique-road-shoes-white/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now from Q36.5</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n","author":"Matthew Loveridge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9f1d3b0049e06088e2a9bf260d4b7db63b1fbf43db475a9fce5e052f532da9d9","category":"Cycling"}
