{"title":"12.9-Inch iPad Pro Now Delivers as Late as Mid-July","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-delivers-as-late-as-mid-july/","date":1620223856000,"content":"While the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is set to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-shipping-may-21/\">in the second half of May</a>, orders placed today are estimated for delivery as late as mid-July on Apple's online store in the United States â€” some two months later. The new 11-inch iPad Pro is faring better so far, with some configurations available for delivery in the last week of May.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPad-Pro-July-Shipping.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a Liquid Retina XDR Display with mini-LED backlighting, providing higher brightness and improved contrast ratio, but Apple suppliers have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/high-end-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issue/\">reportedly faced yield issues</a> producing the display. The consumer electronics industry is also facing a global chip shortage that is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/apple-supplier-tsmc-chip-shortage-2022/\">expected to last into 2022</a>, and this could be having an impact on iPad Pro shipping estimates to some extent.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iPad Pro was announced at Apple's Spring Loaded event on April 20, so the fact that some customers might not get the device into their hands until mid-July underscores the issues that Apple is facing with supply.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iMac is also facing delivery estimates of mid-to-late June for many configurations in the United States, and even a four pack of AirTags won't arrive until mid-June.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-delivers-as-late-as-mid-july/\">12.9-Inch iPad Pro Now Delivers as Late as Mid-July</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-now-delivers-as-late-as-mid-july.2294930/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VvOAwAXaAGM:Xj1HMxHl2Dg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VvOAwAXaAGM:Xj1HMxHl2Dg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VvOAwAXaAGM\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35f17f25b75c5156e1a8ff7c1e3430611c3e5bceb648a1ee5754fefb6a155af7","category":"Apple"}
