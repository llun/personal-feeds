The only drawback to using Apple Fitness+ with AirPlay is that on-screen metrics such as heart rate and calories burned are not displayed on the Mac, but they can still be viewed on an Apple Watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirPlay to Mac is supported on the following Mac models running macOS Monterey:<ul><li>MacBook Pro (2018 and later)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>MacBook Air (2018 and later)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>iMac (2019 and later)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Mac mini (2020 and later)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Mac Pro (2019)</li></ul>We've encountered issues with Apple Fitness+ workouts over AirPlay on macOS Monterey, but the software update is currently in beta. The feature should be functional by time macOS Monterey is publicly released later this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple Fitness+ was not supported on the Mac until now, as there is no Fitness app for Mac and the service is not available on the web.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLaunched in December 2020, Apple Fitness+ is a subscription-based service that provides access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. Apple Fitness+ can be accessed in the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with a few exceptions. The service is priced at $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year in the United States and is available in five other countries.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/\">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-fitness-plus-will-work-with-airplay-to-mac/\">macOS Monterey Brings Apple Fitness+ to the Mac With AirPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-monterey-brings-apple-fitness-to-the-mac-with-airplay.2301202/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4ICV7nCr_6A:YKpfpilyKFQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4ICV7nCr_6A:YKpfpilyKFQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4ICV7nCr_6A\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"37d10c5daa15ec3726b5e83717286752bc4f10305ab626befaae8ee96cb97369","category":"Apple"}
