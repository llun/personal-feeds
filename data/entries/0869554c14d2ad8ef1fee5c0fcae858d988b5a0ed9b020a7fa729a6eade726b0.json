It's also really good.

For the longest time, Honda wouldn't bring the Civic Type-R to these shores. And the affordable \"it car\" <em>du jour</em> is the Toyota GR Yaris, a three-cylinder fun machine that wins over everyone who drives it. Everyone in Europe and Japan that is, because Americans will need to wait a quarter-century to find out how the Yaris handles the Cherahola Skyway, Mount Palomar, or Angeles Crest Highway—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/porsche-will-start-testing-a-lower-carbon-biofuel-in-racing/\">assuming you can still buy gasoline</a> to run it.</p>\n<p>Well, not this time. Say hello to the $32,250 Hyundai Veloster N, a bonkers little thing with asymmetric doors and handling tuned on the mighty Nürburgring Nordschleife. Shockingly, not only is it on sale here in the US, but it's not available to our cousins on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>In 2020, I finally tried out one of Hyundai's Velosters, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/the-2020-hyundai-veloster-turbo-a-quirky-hot-hatch-but-not-enough-fun/\">in this case, the Turbo model</a>. My conclusion at the time was that the fully loaded Veloster Turbo was let down by its dual clutch transmission and that I suspected the similarly priced Veloster N would be better. As it turns out, I was correct.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760117#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760117&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
