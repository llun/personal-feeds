But instead of using oxygen to do so, it uses nitrate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is a very weird, [newly discovered] organism,” said Jana Milucka, a biologist at the Max Planck Genome Center in Cologne and senior author on the resulting paper, published in</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nature</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in early March.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team named the bacteria </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candidatus Azoamicus ciliaticola</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning \"nitrogen-friend that lives inside a ciliate.\" Its partner, the ciliate, is a microorganism that moves around using cilia, tiny hair-like protrusions outside their cell walls. The host organism is part of a group of ciliates called Plagiopylea.</span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749764#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749764&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14d138231c340192ac1725f8270664113005544341f35998c39737a0e3677dc0","category":"Tech"}
