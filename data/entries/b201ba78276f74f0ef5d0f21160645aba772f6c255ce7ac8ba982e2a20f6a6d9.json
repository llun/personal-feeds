SongPop Party is a new game for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV — exclusively on Apple Arcade.</p>\n\n<p>With tens of thousands of hit songs, there’s music for everyone in the family to enjoy. Unlock playlists spanning all decades and genres in a fast-paced competition. Play solo, host a local party with up to 8 friends, or compete online in arena mode. SongPop Party is already included if you’ve got an Apple Arcade or Apple One subscription — all you need to do is download it. We played it over the weekend and it’s a lot of fun — a terrific party game.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/23/songpop-party\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b201ba78276f74f0ef5d0f21160645aba772f6c255ce7ac8ba982e2a20f6a6d9","category":"Tech"}
