But since you’re here now, allow us to catch you up on all of the stuff you need to know from the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bring on the rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it was a pretty quiet week for Apple news—even the Epic-Apple trial was uneventful—the rumor mill was in full swing. Just this week we learned about the new MacBook Air, iPhone 13, and a new Apple Music+ service, not to mention new AIrPods possibly arriving this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While we already expected Apple would deliver a redesigned MacBook Air after hearing reports that a new MacBook Pro is in the works, but based on the details we got this week, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346093/the-next-macbook-could-have-white-bezels-to-match-the-imac.html\">it’s going to be quite a change</a>. According to Jon Prosser, Apple’s new ultraportable will come in the iMac colors, sport a white bezel, and ditch the wedge design for the first time since its 2008 launch. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346119/2021-macbook-air-specs-colors-design-ports-magsafe-ram-apple-silicon-price-release.html\">Here’s everything we expect from the new machine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 13</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Details are still being filled in about the next iPhone, and this week we got some small but significant details. First, the rumors say Apple is making the camera bump a bit thicker and larger as compared to the iPhone 12 Pro, which could mean that big changes are coming to the camera. And DigiTimes reported that Apple has shrunk a key component of the True Depth camera system, which fits in with the rumors of a smaller notch. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/iphone-2021-rumors-specs-120hz-a15-display-notch-camera-colors-release-date.html\">Catch up on everything we know </a>about the next iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Music+ and AirPods</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the loaded Spring Loaded event, we thought Apple was done with new stuff until at least WWDC, but now we’re not so sure. A new rumor this week claims that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346526/apple-music-plus-third-gen-airpods-may-18-rumor.html\">Apple will be launching two new products next week</a>: Apple Music+ and the third-generation AirPods. Apple Music is expected to bring high-fidelity sound for the first time—and isn’t expected to cost any more than the current $10 per month. And what better way to listen to those lossless tunes than with a new pair of AIrPods with shorter stems and likely better battery life. Now, we’re <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346595/nobody-needs-hifi-apple-music.html\">not sure anyone actually needs Apple Music+</a> but well, that’s beside the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirTag</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, we don’t have rumors about the next AirTag just yet, but we do have a few ideas about what it should include.
