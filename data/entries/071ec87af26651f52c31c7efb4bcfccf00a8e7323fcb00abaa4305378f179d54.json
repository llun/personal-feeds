But Amazon’s <a href=\"/misc/2021/03/amazon-icon-old.png\">previous iOS app icon</a> was, objectively, terrible. For one thing, the only thing about it that branded it as Amazon’s was the word “Amazon”. When your icon is your name, you’ve probably got a problem. But the other problem was the shopping cart. The whole point of Amazon being an online store is that you don’t need a shopping cart. They’ve been stretching this metaphor <a href=\"/misc/2021/03/amazon-ancient.jpeg\">for over two decades</a> but it’s not a good one.</p>\n\n<p>I love the idea of using a cardboard box as the icon. <em>That’s</em> the iconic real-world object we all associate with Amazon. Sure sometimes you’re just getting something boring like toothpaste or deodorant. But sometimes you get something great — like a new book you preordered a few months back and sort of forgot about. Sometimes a box from Amazon is <em>fun</em>. So hell yes, make the app icon a fun cardboard box.</p>\n\n<p>My problem with the new icon isn’t that the tape looked like a Hitler mustache. (They could’ve solved that by just <a href=\"/misc/2021/03/amazon-tape-both-ends.png\">putting tape on both ends of the box</a> — boxes need tape on the bottom too.) It’s that the ethos of utterly flat design robs the concept of <em>fun</em>. Look at how much better the <a href=\"/misc/2021/03/installer-package.png\">MacOS standard installer package icon</a> looks than Amazon’s new icon. Just for a boring installer. Amazon is doing the right thing by today’s design trend — it’s the trend that’s wrong, and designers need to start asserting otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king; in the land of militantly flat design, a little bit of depth will spark joy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Amazon Tweaks Their New iOS App Icon’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/02/amazon-icon\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"071ec87af26651f52c31c7efb4bcfccf00a8e7323fcb00abaa4305378f179d54","category":"Tech"}
