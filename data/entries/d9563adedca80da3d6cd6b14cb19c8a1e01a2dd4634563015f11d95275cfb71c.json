Spaces originally launched last year, and since, only certain Twitter users have had access to the feature.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Today, we’re bringing the ability to host a Space to all accounts with 600 or more followers on Twitter. Based on what we’ve learned so far, these accounts are likely to have a good experience hosting live conversations because of their existing audience.</blockquote>Twitter in March said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/twitter-spaces-chat-feature-april-launch/\">Spaces would be available to everyone by April</a>, and with that timeframe now passed, the company says it wants to learn, and hear more from users before it officially switches the feature on for all users.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Before bringing the ability to create a Space to everyone, we’re focused on learning more, making it easier to discover Spaces, and helping people enjoy them with a great audience. </blockquote>Alongside the wider pool of users with access to Spaces, Twitter also revealed that it is working on the ability for users to pay for tickets to attend Spaces as a way to monetize the feature. Twitter says it will only take a \"small amount\" of commission from the ticket sales.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/twitter-spaces-more-than-6oo-followers/\">Twitter Opens Spaces to All Users with More Than 600 Followers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-opens-spaces-to-all-users-with-more-than-600-followers.2294659/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nwbm_ep92pQ:pv9bWdp-Eow:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nwbm_ep92pQ:pv9bWdp-Eow:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nwbm_ep92pQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d9563adedca80da3d6cd6b14cb19c8a1e01a2dd4634563015f11d95275cfb71c","category":"Apple"}
