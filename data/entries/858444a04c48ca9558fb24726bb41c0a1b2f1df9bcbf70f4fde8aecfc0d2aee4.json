Magic Lasso Adblock is an efficient, high performance ad blocker for your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.  Magic Lasso Adblock provides up to a <a href=\"https://www.magiclasso.co/insights/difference-adblocking/\">2.0× speed increase on common websites</a>, improves your privacy and security by removing ad trackers, and works with Safari across all Apple devices. It works and feels as if Apple themselves had designed an ad blocker.</p>\n\n<p>And unlike some other ad blockers, Magic Lasso Adblock respects your privacy, doesn’t accept payment from advertisers, and is 100% supported by its community of over 200,000 users. And it respects privacy-respecting ads like those on DF itself. (DF ads set no cookies, don’t execute any JavaScript, and are served from DF’s own server.)</p>\n\n<p>Download for free today via the <a href=\"https://www.magiclasso.co/\">Magic Lasso website</a>, the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-lasso-adblock-for-safari/id1260462853?ls=1\">iOS App Store</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-lasso-adblock-for-safari/id1198047227?ls=1\">Mac App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/09/magic-lasso\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"858444a04c48ca9558fb24726bb41c0a1b2f1df9bcbf70f4fde8aecfc0d2aee4","category":"Tech"}
