As Apple explains: \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The all-new Center Stage uses the Ultra Wide camera and machine learning to change the way you participate in video calls. As you move around, it automatically pans to keep you center in the frame. When others join in or leave the call, the view expands or zooms in. Center Stages works with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> and other video conferencing app for an even more engaging experience.</blockquote>The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Pros were one of a handful of new announcements Apple made during its \"Spring Loaded\" event.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/april-2021-event/\">April 2021 event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/m1-ipad-pro-center-stage-selfie-camera/\">M1 iPad Pro Selfie Camera Can Automatically Pan and Zoom to Keep You in Frame During Video Calls</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-ipad-pro-selfie-camera-can-automatically-pan-and-zoom-to-keep-you-in-frame-during-video-calls.2292405/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vqpKEurrkEA:JqaHYYKYJ9g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vqpKEurrkEA:JqaHYYKYJ9g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vqpKEurrkEA\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e3d620804e71cf7cbe69b3048bbc3bcd175f7aa57c0c6535d962294ef7836963","category":"Apple"}
