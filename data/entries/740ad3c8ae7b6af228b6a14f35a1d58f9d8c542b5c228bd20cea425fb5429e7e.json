Critics have derided it as a \"jobs program\" intended to retain employees at key centers, such as Alabama-based Marshall, as well as those at primary contractors such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Aerojet Rocketdyne. Such criticism has been bolstered by frequent schedule delays—the SLS was originally due to launch in 2016, and the rocket will now launch no sooner than 2022—as well as cost overruns.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749541#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749541&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"740ad3c8ae7b6af228b6a14f35a1d58f9d8c542b5c228bd20cea425fb5429e7e","category":"Tech"}
