Christie’s auction house, which hosted the sale,\nconfirmed his statement, also declining to reveal his legal name.</p>\n\n<p>Metakovan is the chief financier behind Metapurse, a crytpo-based\nfund that acquires NFTs and other virtual properties; it claims to\nbe the largest NFT fund in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So an investor in an NFT venture made sure an NFT auction made news headlines? I’ll gladly admit I don’t understand this entire NFT thing, but this seems like a publicity scam.</p>\n\n<p><small>* <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/bloomberg-big-con\">Don’t get me started on this outfit</a>.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Robbing Peter to Buy Paul’s NFT’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/12/metakovan-nft-art\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5e1421e4d67e4ca9f4fafa39e9dc0032493ddfd0cbba4184f3bdc47633552952","category":"Tech"}
