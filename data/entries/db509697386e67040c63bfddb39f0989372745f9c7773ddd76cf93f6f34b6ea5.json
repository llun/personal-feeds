Amazon has discounted the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods with Wired Charged case to $100</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Airpods Pro to $190</a>, both all-time low prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These AirPods are the same as the more expensive model except for the case. While wireless charging is nice, however, we don’t think it’s a necessary feature, especially when you’re saving $50 by downgrading. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">In our review of the model with the wireless case</a>, we called the AirPods “the best true wireless earbuds around” and also said “wireless charging isn’t a big deal” due to slower charging times and the excellent battery life of the AirPods. It’s just as easy to plug in a Lightning cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro are Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds that normally retail for $249. Amazon has knocked $70 off the price, bringing it down to the usual refurbished price. AirPods Pro have noise-cancellation and a tighter fit than the regular AirPods. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">In our review</a>, we called them “effortless,” “rock-solid” and “delightful” and highly recommended them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’ve been wanting a pair of AirPods but didn’t want to spend a ton of money, these are the deals you’ve been waiting for.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"db509697386e67040c63bfddb39f0989372745f9c7773ddd76cf93f6f34b6ea5","category":"Apple"}
