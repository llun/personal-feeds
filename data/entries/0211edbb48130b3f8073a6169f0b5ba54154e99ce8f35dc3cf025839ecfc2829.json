So with that in mind, we posted this poll on our Twitter feed to you, dear reader: Who do you think should be Cook’s successor? And here are the results.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>OK, we know Tim Cook isn't retiring for a while, but if he was, who do you think should be his successor?</p>— Macworld (@macworld) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/macworld/status/1380250069870465025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-342867-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><h2>Federighi finishes first</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Senior VP <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/leadership/craig-federighi/&amp;subid1=1-1-342867-0-0-0\">Craig Federighi</a> was the top choice in the poll and that’s not surprising. Of all of Apple’s <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/leadership/&amp;subid1=1-1-342867-0-0-0\">leaders</a>, Federighi is the most recognized by Apple users and fans. He has taken over the mantle of showmanship during Apple events, able to combine enthusiasm, intelligence, humor, and charm in performances that are must-see. Plus he seems like a really great guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>It definitely should be someone who knows Apple inside out and Craig is that. Plus, he looks the part for being the face of Apple and he knows how to present product info clearly and in depth.

That’s probably why Chief Operating Officer <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/leadership/jeff-williams/&amp;subid1=1-1-342867-0-0-0\">Jeff Williams</a> did poorly in our poll—despite the fact that Cook himself was COO before becoming CEO. Some of our readers appreciated that fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>But the current CEO's preference should be for Jeff Williams. Both apparently have very similar characteristics and personalities. But I am not convinced that it would be the best option.</p>— _asfonseca 😷💉 (@_asfonseca) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/_asfonseca/status/1380256054672551942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-342867-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I concur. Jeff Williams is the most probable successor.</p>— iHadrami  (@iHadrami_) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/iHadrami_/status/1380258676443918340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-342867-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><h2>Joz needs to market himself better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Senior VP <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/leadership/greg-joswiak/&amp;subid1=1-1-342867-0-0-0\">Greg “Joz” Jozwiak</a> finished last in our poll. That’s not because he’s incapable of the job, but more likely that the people who voted in our poll aren’t that familiar with him. He replaced Phil Schiller last August and has recently been more present during Apple events. Another reason he didn’t do well in our poll: he’s a marketing guy, not a “product” guy, and as I mentioned before, Macworld readers have a preference for product people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Federighi is popular because of his charismatic personality, but he is a technician and not a business executive. From this list, the best options are, without a doubt, Joswiak and Williams. I would prefer Joswiak, he seems to be more daring and has a more expansive personality.</p>— _asfonseca 😷💉 (@_asfonseca) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/_asfonseca/status/1380254878371614724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-342867-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><h2>The walking dead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Zombie Steve Jobs got the second-most votes in our poll, and we’re not surprised. When there’s a joke answer in a poll, some people will pick it, regardless of what they really believe. (I’m guilty of doing that.) But there’s a sizeable section of Apple’s fan base that is devoted to Steve Jobs, and a vote here is symbolic of that devotion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you really, really want a zombie Steve Jobs as CEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we were trying to be funny, but some of you took exception to our suggestion that a waking dead man could run the most powerful company in the world. Which goes to show that we here at Macworld should just stick to providing helpful and insightful content and stay away from the business of deciding the company’s next leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Wow that's bad taste</p>— Benj Edwards (@benjedwards) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/benjedwards/status/1380250489770622978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-342867-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>\"Zombie Steve Jobs\"?
