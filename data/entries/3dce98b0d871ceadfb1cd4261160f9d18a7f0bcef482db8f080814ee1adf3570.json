bikes. It looks superb in the flesh and rides beautifully.</p>\n<p>The star is the Italian-made frameset. The tubes are custom-shaped to Condor’s specifications and are tripled butted. The ride is lively and smoothes out the rough stuff – exactly what is desired from a steel frame.</p>\n<p>The frame has also been updated over the older version of the Fratello, with thru-axles, flat-mount disc brakes and internal routing for Di2. There is also internal routing for a dynamo light in the front fork.</p>\n<p>At this price point, we would expect hydraulic disc brakes but the Fratello came with cable-actuated disc brakes, showing not the best value for money.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-condor-fratello-disc-review/\">Read our Condor Fratello Disc review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n

The compliant and comfortable nature of a steel frame also lends itself well to this role. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Versatility</span></h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On the right bike, mudguards can even complement its look.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>As steel bikes often err towards the endurance side of things, you’ll typically find provision to fit mudguards and racks, as well as generous tyres clearances. This gives them a level of versatility that isn’t often found on aluminium or carbon bikes. </span></p>\n<p><span>Tradition and physical constraints also mean that steel road bikes tend to use the most unfussy of standards – threaded <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">bottom brackets</a>, external cables and external headsets make sourcing replacement parts and maintenance a breeze.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Longevity</span></h3>\n<p><span>In the event of a frame failure, steel bikes are far, far easier to repair than other materials such as titanium, carbon or aluminium. </span></p>\n<p><span>It’s possible to go as far as replacing entire tubes, but that may not be economical in many cases. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, for small repairs, you may be surprised by how affordable the prices your friendly local frame builder will charge. </span></p>\n<h3><span>Double-butt-what-now?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Manufacturers will often quote the steel that is used to construct its frames.</span></p>\n<p><span>More expensive tubesets will see increasingly exotic tube shapes used to tune ride quality, ultra-thin-walled tubing that reduces weight and can result in a lively ride, and double- or even triple-butted forming. </span></p>\n<p><span>Big names in the tubing industry include Reynolds, Tange, Columbus and <span>Dedacciai</span>. It’s also increasingly common to see brands speccing their own ‘custom-drawn’ tubing. </span></p>\n<p><span>The difference in ride quality between bog-standard straight un-butted ‘gas pipe’ tubing and high-end ultra-thin-walled tubing is fairly chasmic. However, everything in the middle range is much of a muchness. </span></p>\n<p><span>Geometry and tyre choice will have a far greater impact on how a steel road bike rides than tube choice here. </span></p>\n<p><span>That said, there is no denying that the ride quality of truly skinny steel can be absolutely sublime, with a zingy spring that is quite unlike anything else. </span></p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"3dce98b0d871ceadfb1cd4261160f9d18a7f0bcef482db8f080814ee1adf3570","category":"Cycling"}
