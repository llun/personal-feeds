Presumably, this would have functioned in much the same way that the smart connector did on the first and second-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros, third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, and seventh and eighth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, in order to be able to connect to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/\">Smart Keyboard</a> or accessories such as Logitech's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/26/logi-base-ipad-pro-stand/\">Logi BASE</a> &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; charging dock in landscape mode. The two-port system apparently also supported concurrent charging.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBeyond docking in accessories such as keyboards, two ports could also have opened up the option for connecting to multiple wired accessories such as external hard drives or SD card readers via a dongle for compatibility with the 30-pin connector, without the need for a multi-port adapter.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPrototype first-generation iPads with two ports have been seen a number of times before, with some images even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2012/05/28/prototype-original-ipad-with-dual-dock-connectors-surfaces/\">showing the internals</a> of a two-port &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Patents <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2010/09/25/apple-ipad-design-patents-showing-dual-dock-connectors/\">depicting the dual-port design</a> have also come to light in the past.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple reportedly chose to remove the feature in the design verification testing stage. While Apple has launched 22 different &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models in six screen sizes, every &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model to date has only had just one port for data transfer and charging.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGiven that some &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; power-users hope that the tablet will one day feature more than one port to aid productivity, it is interesting that Apple considered implementing such a feature long before the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> or even the switch to a USB-C connector on some models. Some may believe that the images prove that Apple saw the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a productivity-oriented device long before it was truly capable of doing so with features such as multitasking, the Files app, or mouse support.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-planned-ipad-with-two-ports/\">Images of Prototype Show Apple Planned iPad With Two Ports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/images-of-prototype-show-apple-planned-ipad-with-two-ports.2289959/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WiXQLu3sXRQ:_4Ijp0JiuVA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WiXQLu3sXRQ:_4Ijp0JiuVA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/WiXQLu3sXRQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a82dfda2a2533afcd93effdeab4bd430360fd048445c4c559d4c47e78a4e968e","category":"Apple"}
