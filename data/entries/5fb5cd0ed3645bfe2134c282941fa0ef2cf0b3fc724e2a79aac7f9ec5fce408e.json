The intruder changed the level of sodium hydroxide to 11,100 parts per million, a significant increase from the normal amount of 100 ppm, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in a Monday morning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M\">press conference</a>.</p>\n<p>Better known as lye, sodium hydroxide is used in small amounts to treat the acidity of water and to remove metals. It’s also the active ingredient in liquid drain cleaners. It higher levels, it's toxic. Had the change not been reversed almost immediately, it would have raised the amount of chemical to toxic levels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740652#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740652&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5fb5cd0ed3645bfe2134c282941fa0ef2cf0b3fc724e2a79aac7f9ec5fce408e","category":"Tech"}
