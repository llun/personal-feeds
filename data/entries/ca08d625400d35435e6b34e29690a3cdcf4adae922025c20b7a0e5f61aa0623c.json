Two groups representing fiber and rural Internet providers yesterday <a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10208168836021/FBA_LEO_RDOF_Assessment_Final_Report_20210208.pdf\">submitted a report to the FCC</a> claiming that Starlink will hit a capacity shortfall in 2028, when the satellite service may be required to hit a major FCC deployment deadline.</p>\n<p>The study was commissioned by the Fiber Broadband Association (FBA) and NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association.

The funding for SpaceX and other ISPs won't be finalized until the FCC reviews their long-form applications, which were submitted after the reverse auction.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10208168836021/FBA-NTCA%20RDOF%20LEO%20Cover%20Letter%204821-7568-7899%20020821.pdf\">filing</a> accompanying the study they commissioned, the FBA and NTCA told the FCC:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740946#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740946&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca08d625400d35435e6b34e29690a3cdcf4adae922025c20b7a0e5f61aa0623c","category":"Tech"}
