We didn't have much detail on Mendez's reasoning last month, but we've since obtained a <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/california-net-neutrality-ruling-transcript.pdf\">not-yet-publicly released transcript of the hearing</a> in which he issued his verbal ruling against the injunction. (He did not issue a written ruling, citing time constraints caused by a shortage of judges in his district.)</p>\n<p>Mendez's denial of the injunction means that California can enforce its net neutrality law while the case continues, leaving open the possibility that Mendez could ultimately side with the broadband industry. But Mendez explained during the hearing why he thinks the industry is unlikely to succeed at trial.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750370#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750370&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c45022470d4e26f533578586f55fa17195c4fe4f3ae5fd6415f931fbb25074a","category":"Tech"}
