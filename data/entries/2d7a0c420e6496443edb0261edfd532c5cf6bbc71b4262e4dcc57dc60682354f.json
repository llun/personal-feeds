I apologize for the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/even-power-disasters-are-bigger-in-texas-heres-why/\">unplanned hiatus</a> last week. The Rocket Report's Houston-based author lacked power until Wednesday night amidst a massive winter storm and had no reliable Internet until Friday afternoon. We still had no hot water at our house, but at least we're no longer freezing. We're back just in time to spew all manner of spicy launch news this week.</p>\n<p>As always, Ars <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcomes reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).
