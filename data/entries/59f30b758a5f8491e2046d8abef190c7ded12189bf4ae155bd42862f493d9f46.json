Is it more like a language, or more like math? Some new research may have settled this question by watching the brain’s activity while subjects read Python code.</p>\n<h2>Two schools on schooling</h2>\n<p>Right now, there are two schools of thought. The prevailing one is that coding is a type of language, with its own grammar rules and syntax that must be followed. After all, they’re called coding <i>languages</i> for a reason, right? This idea even has its own snazzy acronym: Coding as Another Language, or CAL.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749712#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749712&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59f30b758a5f8491e2046d8abef190c7ded12189bf4ae155bd42862f493d9f46","category":"Tech"}
