{"title":"Flu Has Disappeared Worldwide During the COVID Pandemic","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-worldwide-during-the-covid-pandemic/","date":1619818894000,"content":"\n<p>Katie Peek, reporting for Scientific American:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since the novel coronavirus began its global spread, influenza\ncases reported to the World Health Organization have dropped to\nminuscule levels. The reason, epidemiologists think, is that the\npublic health measures taken to keep the coronavirus from\nspreading also stop the flu. Influenza viruses are transmitted in\nmuch the same way as SARS-CoV-2, but they are less effective at\njumping from host to host.</p>\n\n<p>As <em>Scientific American</em> <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/flu-season-never-came-to-the-southern-hemisphere1/\">reported last fall</a>, the drop-off in\nflu numbers was both swift and universal. Since then, cases have\nstayed remarkably low. “There’s just <em>no</em> flu circulating,” says\nGreg Poland, who has studied the disease at the Mayo Clinic for\ndecades. The U.S. saw about 600 deaths from influenza during the\n2020-2021 flu season. In comparison, the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention estimated there were roughly 22,000 deaths\nin the prior season and 34,000 two seasons ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These numbers are just ridiculous. It goes to show how much more contagious COVID is than influenza — COVID continued to wreak havoc in the face of precaution that practically eliminated spread of the flu. And it also shows how in the early days of the pandemic — like in New York City here in the U.S. — having no precautions in place allowed COVID to spread like wildfire.</p>\n\n<p>Questions: Will masking during flu season remain a thing here in the U.S.? We know now that COVID spreads primarily through aerosols, but how much of this reduction in influenza is thanks to increased handwashing and sanitizing? I love the idea of making hand sanitizer dispensers at store entrances standard.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/30/flu-disappeared\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"69c3dc9f067181c511f64a894c02abea0c021cdbb82758e6e1d11155ad4d1203","category":"Tech"}
