But whereas the previous version placed its Igus solid bushings in the links and pivoted on hollow aluminum pins, the new one moves the bushings to the post and head, and switches to solid 300-series stainless steel pins for improved longevity, smoother motion, and quieter operation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The links themselves are also lower-profile with more sculpted edges than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-486197\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The basic design of the eeSilk carries over, but there are also a number of key changes. The aluminum model&#8217;s stainless steel hardware will unfortunately require a 10 mm wrench (maybe an 8 mm?) to make angle adjustments.

Aluminum models are fitted with stainless steel bolts, while the carbon fiber posts are equipped with custom titanium hardware (including a slick machined titanium thumbwheel for the forward seatpost cradle bolt). Although the new eeSilk has interchangeable inserts to account for different rider weights and ride-quality preferences, both posts still have a 113 kg (250 lb) weight limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of weight, the durability-minded updates do add a bit of mass up top, and claimed figures have crept up as a result. The previous aluminum-only eeSilk tipped the scales at 295 g for a 27.2 mm size, but the new aluminum model is now 345 g for the same diameter; only when you get the nicer carbon fiber one will you hit that same sub-300 g figure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-486198\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-3.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The eeSilk seatpost is intentionally designed to be lightweight and visually unobtrusive. Photo: Cane Creek.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that some of the increased weight is due to the longer stock shaft length, which is now 375 g for aluminum seatposts and 350 mm for carbon fiber ones. As a result, the real-world weight gain is actually more modest, especially for particularly weight-focused riders that might end up lopping off any unneeded length, anyway. Both will also be offered in 31.6 mm diameters, which add 5 g to the aluminum model and 10 g to the carbon one. Other diameters can be accommodated with shims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the upside, pieces have come down, with the aluminum model now having a retail price of US$199 / £210 — a substantial US$90 drop from before — and the carbon fiber one costing US$299 / £330, which is only US$10 more than the original aluminum-only eeSilk. Pricing for other regions is still to be confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-486201\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cane-Creek-eeSilk-seatpost-v2-5.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The carbon fiber eeSilk seatpost will come with lighter-weight titanium hardware, similar to what&#8217;s shown here on the original eeSilk.
