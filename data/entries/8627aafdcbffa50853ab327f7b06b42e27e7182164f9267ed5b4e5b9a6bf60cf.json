However, following another series of images shared courtesy of social media consultant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068647025664025?s=20\">Matt Navarra</a>, Facebook has now publicly confirmed via <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/instagram-tests-letting-users-post-to-feeds-from-desktop\">Bloomberg</a></em> that the feature is indeed in the works.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>More screenshots of creating + publishing posts via <a href=\"https://t.co/3QaHTLlqBE\">https://t.co/3QaHTLlqBE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/G5mptOhN06\">pic.twitter.com/G5mptOhN06</a></p>â€” Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1408068652495097862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 24, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><blockquote>\"We know that many people access Instagram from their computer,\" said Facebook spokeswoman Christine Pai. \"To improve that experience, we're now testing the ability to create a Feed post on Instagram with their desktop browser.\"</blockquote>There's still no word on an official Instagram app built specifically for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, but presumably a browser-based way of posting would offer an alternative option for tablet users.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/25/desktop-instagram-posting-in-the-works/\">Desktop Instagram Posting Currently Being Tested, Confirms Facebook</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/desktop-instagram-posting-currently-being-tested-confirms-facebook.2302230/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FmNU7jKDihI:2UzFMHK4MwU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FmNU7jKDihI:2UzFMHK4MwU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FmNU7jKDihI\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8627aafdcbffa50853ab327f7b06b42e27e7182164f9267ed5b4e5b9a6bf60cf","category":"Apple"}
