So for example, if Spotify is selected and you say \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, play Moonlight Drive by The Doors,\" you no longer have to specify \"...on Spotify\" to prevent it from trying to play the track in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/\">The 8-Bit</a></em>, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will also set a music streaming service as the default if you ask it to play from that particular app for the first time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to users who have played with the feature, it only works with specific phrases at the moment, and sometimes revert back to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, so it sounds like there's still some work to do on Apple's end before it's fully consistent.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\niOS 14.5 is the biggest update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> to date, introducing several significant new features, including the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/unlock-iphone-wearing-mask-with-apple-watch/\">unlock your iPhone using an Apple Watch when wearing a mask</a>.
