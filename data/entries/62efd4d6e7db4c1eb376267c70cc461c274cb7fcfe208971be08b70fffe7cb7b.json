{"title":"AWS Local Zones Are Now Open in Boston, Miami, and Houston","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-local-zones-are-now-open-in-boston-miami-and-houston/","date":1620748504000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/\">AWS Local Zones</a> place select AWS services (compute, storage, database, and so forth) close to large population, industry, and IT centers. They support use cases such as real-time gaming, hybrid migrations, and media &amp; entertainment content creation that need single-digit millisecond latency for end-users in a specific geographic area.</p> \n<p>Last December I <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-more-aws-local-zones/\">told you about our plans</a> to launch a total of fifteen <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/\">AWS Local Zones</a> in 2021, and also announced the preview of the Local Zones in Boston, Miami, and Houston. Today I am happy to announce that these three Local Zones are now ready to host your production workloads, joining the existing pair of Local Zones in Los Angeles. As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-now-available-from-a-local-zone-in-los-angeles/\">original post</a>, each Local Zone is a child of a particular parent region, and is managed by the control plane in the region. The parent region for all three of these zones is <span>US East (N. Virginia)</span>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Using Local Zones</strong></span><br /> To get started, I need to enable the Zone(s) of interest. I can do this from the command line (<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-availability-zone-group.html#modify-availability-zone-group\"><code>modify-availability-zone-group</code></a>), via an API call (<code><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyAvailabilityZoneGroup.html\">ModifyAvailabilityZoneGroup</a></code>), or from within the EC2 Console. From the console, I enter the parent region and click <strong>Zones</strong> in the <strong>Account attributes</strong>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/lz_aa_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I can see the Local Zones that are within the selected parent region. I click <strong>Manage</strong> for the desired Local Zone:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/lz_zones_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I click <strong>Enabled</strong> and <strong>Update zone group</strong>, and I am ready to go!</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/lz_enable_boston_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I can create <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/\">Virtual Private Clouds</a> (VPCs), launch <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">EC2</a> instances, create SSD-backed <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">EBS</a> volumes (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ssd-backed-elastic-block-storage/\">gp2</a>), and set up <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">EKS</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\">ECS</a> clusters in the Local Zone (see the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/features/\">AWS Local Zones Features</a> page for a full list of supported services).</p> \n<p>The new Local Zones currently offer the following instances:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Name</td> \n   <td>Category</td> \n   <td>vCPUs</td> \n   <td>Memory<br /> (GiB)</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>t3.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/\">General Purpose</a></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c5d.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/\">Compute Intensive</a></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>g4dn.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/\">GPU</a></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>r5d.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/r5/\">Memory Intensive</a></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>I can also use EC2 Auto Scaling, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> in the parent region to monitor and control these resources.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Local Zones in Action</strong></span><br /> AWS customers are already making great use of all five operational Local Zones! After talking with my colleagues, I learned that the use cases for Local Zones can be grouped into two categories:</p> \n<p><strong>Distributed Edge</strong> – These customers want to place selected parts of their gaming, social media, and voice assistant applications in multiple, geographically disparate locations in order to deliver a low-latency experience to their users.</p> \n<p><strong>Locality</strong> – These customers need access to cloud services in specific locations that are in close proximity to their existing branch offices, data centers, and so forth. In addition to low-latency access, they often need to process and store data within a specific geographic region in order to meet regulatory requirements. These customers often use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/\">AWS VPN</a> to connect to the desired Local Zone.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://ambrahealth.com/\"><strong>Ambra Health</strong></a> provides a cloud-based medical image management suite that empowers some of the largest health systems, radiology practices, and clinical research organizations. The suite replaces traditional desktop image viewers, and uses Local Zones to provide radiologists with rapid access to high quality images so that they can focus on improving patient outcomes.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.couchbase.com/\"><strong>Couchbase</strong></a> is an award-winning distributed NoSQL cloud database for modern enterprise applications. Couchbase is using AWS Local Zones to provide low latency and single-digit millisecond data access times for applications, ensuring developers’ apps are always available and fast. Using Local Zones, along with Couchbase’s edge computing capabilities, means that their customers are able to store, query, search, and analyze data in real-time</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://edgegap.com/\"><strong>Edgegap</strong></a> is a game hosting service provider focused on providing the best online experience for their customers. AWS Local Zones gives their customers (game development studios such as <a href=\"https://triple-hill.com/\">Triple Hill Interactive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brutalgrounds.com/\">Agog Entertainment</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cofagames.com/\">Cofa Games</a>) the ability to take advantage of ever-growing list of locations and to deploy games with a simple API call.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.jacktrip.org/\"><strong>JackTrip</strong></a> is using Local Zones to allow musicians in multiple locations to collaboratively perform well-synchronized live music over the Internet.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.masomo.com/\"><strong>Masomo</strong></a> is an interactive entertainment company that focuses on mobile games including Basketball Arena and Head Ball 2. They use Local Zones to deploy select, latency-sensitive portions of their game servers close to end users, with the goal of improving latency, reducing churn, and providing players with a great experience.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://supercell.com/en/\"><strong>Supercell</strong></a> deploys game servers in multiple AWS regions, and evaluates all new regions as they come online. They are already using Local Zones as deployment targets and considering additional Local Zones as they become available in order to bring the latency-sensitive portions of game servers closer to more end users.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.takeda.com/en-us/\"><strong>Takeda</strong></a> (a global biopharmaceutical company) is planning to create a hybrid environment that spans multiple scientific centers in and around Boston, with compute-intensive R&amp;D workloads running in the Boston Local Zone.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.ubitus.net/en/index.html\"><strong>Ubitus</strong></a> deploys game servers in multiple locations in order to reduce latency and to provide users with a consistent, high-quality experience. They see Local Zones as a (no pun intended) game-changer, and will use it them to deploy and test clusters in multiple cities in pursuit of that consistent experience.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Learn More</strong></span><br /> Here are some resources to help you learn more about AWS Local Zones:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/\">Local Zones Overview</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/faqs/\">Local Zones FAQs</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/pricing/\">Local Zones Pricing</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-local-zones\">Local Zones Documentation</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-now-available-from-a-local-zone-in-los-angeles/\">AWS Now Available from a Local Zone in Los Angeles</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-a-second-local-zone-in-los-angeles/\">Announcing a Second Local Zone in Los Angeles</a>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-more-aws-local-zones/\">In the Works – 3 More AWS Local Zones in 2020, and 12 More in 2021</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></span><br /> We are currently working on twelve additional AWS Local Zones (Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, and Seattle) and plan to open them throughout the remainder of 2021.
