This comes after well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the third-generation AirPods <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">will enter mass production in the second half of 2021</a>, meaning a launch could be months away.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAt this point, it's unclear if Apple will even be holding its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">rumored March 23 event</a>, as it was generally expected that Apple would have announced the event by today at around 9 a.m. Pacific Time. Of course, Apple could choose to announce the event at a different time, or it could introduce new products with press releases as it did last March.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has a handful of products rumored to be in the pipeline, including its long-awaited AirTags item trackers, a new iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display, new iPad and iPad mini models, and a new Apple TV. A redesigned iMac with Apple silicon is also expected to launch this year, but it's unclear if the computer is ready yet. 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon are not expected until the second half of 2021.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/l0vetodream/\">L0vetodream</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/third-gen-airpods-no-longer-expected-soon/\">Leaker Casts Doubt on Third-Generation AirPods Launching Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-casts-doubt-on-third-generation-airpods-launching-soon.2288539/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=McS2p74OXUY:-8OZglEhi1w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=McS2p74OXUY:-8OZglEhi1w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/McS2p74OXUY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"530171ceffd0bc4a86d129887eae8d41cb3ee8de116065ceebe948192c321993","category":"Apple"}
