For every full-fledged sequel like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> or <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> on the Switch, you've had to face at least one warmed-over Wii U port like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, <em>Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker</em>, or <em>Hyrule Warriors Deluxe</em> (to name just a few).\n<p>While it's nice that these underloved Wii U games are getting a new lease on life (and a new fully portable play option) on the much more popular Switch, the idea of paying full price for a light update to a game you bought less than a decade ago on the Wii U might feel a little grating.</p>\n<p>For its latest Wii U rehash, Nintendo seems to have acknowledged this issue to some extent. The Switch port of the excellent <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> comes packaged with <em>Bowser's Fury</em>, a brand-new bit of \"open world\" content that extends <em>3D World</em>'s gameplay ideas in some interesting new directions. The result is a package that should have any 3D platforming fan at least taking a second look, even if they already bought the game a few years ago.</p>\n<h2>A new kind of 3D Mario</h2>\n<p>If you missed out on <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> the first time around, you might have to adjust your expectations for a 3D Mario platform game a little bit. Much like the 3DS’s <em>Super Mario 3D Land</em> before it, <em>3D World</em> generally avoids the wide-open areas and level-specific goals of games like <em>Super Mario 64</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741072#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741072&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1bafab540151027528250bfdbd58ed48e531461c0232d049642360ac421ac12f","category":"Tech"}
