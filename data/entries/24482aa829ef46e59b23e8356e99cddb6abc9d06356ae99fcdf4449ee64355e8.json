The series follows the fantasy adventures of noble and heroic talking animals. Every book in the series was written by author Brian Jacques, who passed away in 2011 shortly before the publication of the 22nd book.</p>\n<p>The streaming network plans to create both a feature film and an event TV series. The film will be based on the series' first book, which is simply titled <em>Redwall</em>. The screenplay will be written by Patrick McHale, who is best known as the creator of Cartoon Network's critically acclaimed animated miniseries <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741128#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741128&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24482aa829ef46e59b23e8356e99cddb6abc9d06356ae99fcdf4449ee64355e8","category":"Tech"}
