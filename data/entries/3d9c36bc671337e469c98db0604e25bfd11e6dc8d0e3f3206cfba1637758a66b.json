It's used instead of a password for account creation and login, with one-tap login.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you create an account using a passkey, there is no password to deal with. You can access that account with just a login and authentication through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> or Face ID.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNo password is required because your Apple device handles the generation and storage of the unique passkey used for the site, so login is just a matter of entering a username and authenticating. Passkeys are end-to-end encrypted and synced across all of your Apple devices thanks to ‌iCloud‌ Keychain. Since everything is stored in ‌iCloud‌ Keychain, credentials are preserved even if Apple devices are lost or stolen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPasskeys are more secure than most password plus two-factor authentication solutions, and developers can easily implement support for logins via passkeys.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt the current time, passkeys only work with Apple devices, so Apple is talking to partners at FIDO and the World Wide Web Consortium about a wider solution that would allow users to eliminate passwords across non-Apple devices as well.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPasskeys in ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌macOS Monterey‌ are designed for testing and are not for production accounts as Apple tests the feature. Apple is allowing developers to test passkeys as part of a multiyear effort to replace passwords.<blockquote>The emphasis of this preview is the authentication technology, an ‌iCloud‌ Keychain-backed WebAuthn implementation. An industry-wide transition away from passwords will need thoughtful and consistently applied design patterns, which are not part of this preview.</blockquote>Passkeys can be seen in greater detail in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/\">Apple's full WWDC session</a> \"Move beyond passwords.\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/apple-icloud-keychain-passkeys/\">Apple Aiming to Eliminate Passwords With Face ID/Touch ID Passkeys</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aiming-to-eliminate-passwords-with-face-id-touch-id-passkeys.2300327/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4pz6ypW27mM:HzbRed5LP7o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4pz6ypW27mM:HzbRed5LP7o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4pz6ypW27mM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d9c36bc671337e469c98db0604e25bfd11e6dc8d0e3f3206cfba1637758a66b","category":"Apple"}
