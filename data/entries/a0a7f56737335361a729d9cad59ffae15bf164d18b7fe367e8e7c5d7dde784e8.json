Alfonsina became the first woman to compete in men’s professional races when she raced in the Tour of Lombardy in 1917 and 1918, and famously raced in the 1924 <a href=\"/tags/giro-ditalia\">Giro d’Italia</a> after concealing her gender when registering for the race.</p>\n<p>The organisers excluded Alfonsina from the race when she finished outside the time limit after crashing on the stage from L’Aquila to Perugia.</p>\n<blockquote><p>She would be there in the workshop repairing tyres and it was hard to believe that this was the same woman who had broken the Hour record and competed in the Giro d’Italia</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, public support for her was so strong and she was allowed to continue the race, albeit without getting an official finishing position. Nevertheless, Alfonsina captured the public imagination, particularly as she was one of only 30 riders to complete the course out of 90 starters.</p>\n<p>Alfonsina broke the Hour record at the end of her racing career in her forties and in retirement co-owned a bike shop with her second husband and fellow pro racer, Carlo Messori, in Milan.</p>\n<p>Marino Vigna, a track cyclist who won gold in the team pursuit at the Rome 1960 Olympics, lived near the shop and was a regular customer. At the time, he was a teenager, and like other visitors to the bike shop, was in awe of Alfonsina and her achievements.</p>\n<p>He recalls, ‘Everyone knew all the great things Alfonsina had achieved in cycling, but she was very modest. She would be there in the workshop repairing tyres and it was hard to believe that this was the same woman who had broken the Hour record and competed in the Giro d’Italia.’</p>\n<p>Alfonsina died of a heart attack when her motorbike came off its stand, knocking her to the ground. She was 68.</p>\n<div id=\"file-44586\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/nicole_cooke.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Nicole Cooke</h3>\n<p>Olympic Champion, 2008; World Road Race Champion, 2000 and 2008; Ten-time National Road Race Champion</p>\n<h3>Corrine Hall (sighted pilot) and Lora Fachie</h3>\n<p>Paralympic Champions 2016 (Tandem Individual pursuit B); Paracycling World Track Champions, 2017 (Tandem Sprint, Kilo, Pursuit B); World Road Race Champions 2013, 2014 (Tandem Time Trial and Road Race B respectively)</p>\n<h3>Rachel Hedderman (née Heal)</h3>\n<p>First female sports director of a men’s team (ProContinental, UnitedHealthcare) in a WorldTour Race</p>\n<h3>Yvonne McGregor</h3>\n<p>Commonwealth Champion, 1994 (Points race); World Track Cycling Champion, 2000 (Pursuit); Hour record Holder 1995</p>\n<h3>Dervla Murphy</h3>\n<p>Multi-country cycle tourist and travel writer for over 40 years</p>\n<h3>Billie Fleming</h3>\n<p>Long-distance cyclist; former record holder for greatest distance cycled in a year</p>\n<p><strong>For more from Zwift this International Women's Month</strong>, <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5659013978&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">visit here</a></p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9272/cyclists-31-inspirational-women-no1-fiona-kolbinger\">Cyclist&#039;s 31 Inspirational Women No1: Fiona Kolbinger</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9301/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no11-jeannie-longo\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No11: Jeannie Longo</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9311/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no21-marianne-vos\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No21: Marianne Vos</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9321/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no31-marie-odile-amaury\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No31: Marie-Odile Amaury</a></div>    </div></div>  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/cyclists\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Cyclists</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"a0a7f56737335361a729d9cad59ffae15bf164d18b7fe367e8e7c5d7dde784e8","category":"Cycling"}
