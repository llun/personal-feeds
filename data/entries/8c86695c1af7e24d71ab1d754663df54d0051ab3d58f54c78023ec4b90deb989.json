Solid discounts on the entry-level iPad have been few and far between in early 2021, particularly for the 128GB model, so although this isn't quite an all-time low price it is among the best currently available online.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/ipad-sale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790161\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

As of today, we're only tracking a discount for the 128GB model, and this &#36;395.00 price tag is only at Amazon in Space Gray. Silver is available at a higher price of &#36;399.99, but it's also seeing a delayed shipping estimate.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;34 OFF</div>10.2-Inch iPad (128GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;395.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple introduced the eighth-generation iPad in September 2020 as an iterative update to the previous low-cost iPad, but with an upgraded A12 Bionic processor with Neural Engine. This version of the iPad supports Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and includes Touch ID.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor even more iPad deals, head to our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-deals/\">Best Deals guide for iPad</a>.
