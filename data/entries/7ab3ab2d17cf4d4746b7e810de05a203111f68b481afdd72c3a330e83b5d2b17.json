Nor does it hurt having Hunt Wheels as a sister company considering its reputation among the UK’s road and gravel riding fraternity.</p>\n<p>With access to so much rider input, it was only a matter of time before Cairn took a close look at its already successful first-generation e-Adventure and update it with some thoughtfully chosen upgrades and designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cairncycles.com/collections/ebikes-e-adventure\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Cairn E-Adventure now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The most obvious of these is the choice of wheel size. For those who mainly ride on paved surfaces the 700c wheel size of the first generation, e-Adventure is retained, while for those who are more adventurous there’s now a 650b wheel option.</p>\n<p>However, to simply assume that it is one bike with different-sized wheels would be an underestimation of how carefully Cairn designs its bikes. It is not just the wheels that differ between the two options – it’s also the rider contact points.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/cairn_e-adventure_2nd_generation_review_ce_3.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Given that the 650b will see more off-road action it gets flared drop handlebars from Cairn’s own range in place of the Ritchey Butano Comp S on the larger-wheeled road-orientated model.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the saddle is dependant on the chosen wheel size, while the 650b version of the e-Adventure also adds a dropper post into the mix. Until you’ve ridden with one, you won’t appreciate how beneficial it is being able to drop the saddle out of the way on off-road descents.</p>\n<p>One thing that remains unchanged from the first generation of the e-Adventure is the overall geometry of the bike’s aluminium frame.</p>\n<p>However, there are small but subtle changes: lower overall stand-over height, controls for the Favua drive system moved to the frame’s top tube, and a removable seat stay bridge to offer slightly more compliance at the rear of the bike.</p>\n<p>All you have to do now is decide which wheel size is the one for you.
