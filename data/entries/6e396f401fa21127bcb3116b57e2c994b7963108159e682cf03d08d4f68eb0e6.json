Some hundred years later, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ford/\">Ford</a> is now using <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/\">artificial intelligence</a> to eke more speed out of today’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/manufacturing/\">manufacturing lines</a>.</p>\n<p>At a <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/global-plants/livonia-transmission-plant.html\">Ford Transmission Plant</a> in Livonia, Mich., the station where robots help assemble torque converters now includes a system that uses AI to learn from previous attempts how to wiggle the pieces into place most efficiently. Inside a large safety cage, robot arms wheel around grasping circular pieces of metal, each about the diameter of a dinner plate, from a conveyor and slot them together.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761646#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761646&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e396f401fa21127bcb3116b57e2c994b7963108159e682cf03d08d4f68eb0e6","category":"Tech"}
