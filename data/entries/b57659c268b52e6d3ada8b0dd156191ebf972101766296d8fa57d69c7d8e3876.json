The scrub was necessitated by a range issue caused by an airplane in the launch zone. The company will now turn around the vehicle for another launch attempt on Wednesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>SpaceX founder Elon Musk was not happy with the situation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic.</p>\n<p>There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.</p>\n<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1409951549988782087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Original post</strong>: SpaceX is preparing to launch its second dedicated rideshare mission for its Falcon 9 rocket, named Transporter-2, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Tuesday afternoon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776960#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776960&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b57659c268b52e6d3ada8b0dd156191ebf972101766296d8fa57d69c7d8e3876","category":"Tech"}
