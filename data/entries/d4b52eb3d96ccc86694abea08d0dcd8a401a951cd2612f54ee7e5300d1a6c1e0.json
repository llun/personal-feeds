It is \"inevitable\" that some FDA decisions lead to controversy, she wrote, and \"I have tremendous confidence in the integrity of the staff and leadership\" involved in the decision. But, a review is necessary, she added, because the mounting concerns could \"undermine the public's confidence in the FDA's decision.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779094#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779094&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d4b52eb3d96ccc86694abea08d0dcd8a401a951cd2612f54ee7e5300d1a6c1e0","category":"Tech"}
