But don't rejoice too hard; the new support only comes on a few games, and it's only on Windows versions of those games played via <a href=\"https://www.protondb.com/\">Proton</a>.</p>\n<p>At Computex 2021, Nvidia announced a collaboration with Valve to bring DLSS support to Windows games played on Linux systems. This is good news, since DLSS can radically improve frame rates without perceptibly altering graphics quality. Unfortunately, as of this month, fewer than 60 games support DLSS in the first place; of those, roughly half work reasonably well in Proton, with or without DLSS.</p>\n<h2>What’s a DLSS, anyway?</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nvidia-dlss.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nvidia-dlss-640x260.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nvidia-dlss.png\">Nvidia's own benchmarking shows well over double the frame rate in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/metro-exodus-a-good-single-player-game-to-usher-in-the-pc-ray-tracing-era/\">Metro Exodus</a>.</em> Most third-party benchmarks \"only\" show an improvement of 50 to 75 percent. Note the DLSS image actually looks sharper and cleaner than the non-DLSS in this case!</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCcN8kCD90A\">nvidia</a>)</p></div>\n<p>If you're not up on all the gaming graphics jargon, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/\">DLSS</a> is an acronym for Deep Learning Super Sampling. Effectively, DLSS takes a low-resolution image and uses deep learning to upsample it to a higher resolution on the fly. The impact of DLSS can be astonishing in games that support the tech—in some cases more than doubling non-DLSS frame rates, usually with little or no visual impact.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771208#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771208&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be19e77e5af2cf96ff975798bb4f0fc50544e15e164273af0f5eebe74b11b5ce","category":"Tech"}
