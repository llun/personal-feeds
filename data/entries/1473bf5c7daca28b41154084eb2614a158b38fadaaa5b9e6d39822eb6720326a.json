The transition to current owner Ben Cooley was a smooth one, since he’d worked at the shop prior to purchasing it nearly a decade ago.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36943\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597.jpg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597-300x225.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597-768x576.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597-79x59.jpg 79w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2597-1200x900.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>The pandemic and ensuing shut-downs put new emphasis on the importance of bike shops as essential services, Bicycle Sport has always played a part in shaping the local cycling scene. Along with sponsoring events, teams, shop rides, and fundraisers, Cooley and partners also helped co-found Charlotte’s “Learn to Ride” program.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36940 aligncenter\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592.jpg 1500w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592-225x300.jpg 225w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592-44x59.jpg 44w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_2592-900x1200.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /></p>\n<p>While we all love new bike day, being able to put a customer on a “dream bike” like a Moots is a special experience for Ben and the team at Bicycle Sport.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>“We know this isn’t an everyday thing for most cyclists,” adds Cooley. “Every little detail matters, and we want to make their Moots be everything they expect it should be.” <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>As the shop’s owner, Cooley has plenty of bikes to choose from. But it’s his own Moots Routt that sees the bulk of the mileage along his favorite rides in the western North Carolina high country.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moots.com/moots-dealer-spotlight-bicycle-sport/\">MOOTS DEALER SPOTLIGHT&#8211; BICYCLE SPORT</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots</a>.</p>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"1473bf5c7daca28b41154084eb2614a158b38fadaaa5b9e6d39822eb6720326a","category":"Cycling"}
