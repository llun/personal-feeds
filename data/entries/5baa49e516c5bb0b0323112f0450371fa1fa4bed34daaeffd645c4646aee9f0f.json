Then there is a whole list of options that can transform it for other purposes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.r-m.de/en-gb/bikes/nevo3/nevo3-gt-vario/#F00431_05031211\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Riese &amp; Muller Nevo3 GT Vario now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Like to go off-road? Why not try the GX option, which provides all-terrain tyres for comfort and grip, wide flat pedals to allow you to keep pedalling no matter what shoes you’re wearing or how muddy you get, and ergonomic bar-end handles to provide a range of hand positions that make even the hardest of climbs less of a struggle.</p>\n<p>If on the other hand you’re considering an e-bike as an alternative to a second car, something that can be used for short shopping trips or carry small children on the school run, then consider the Heavy Duty package, which validates the bike for loads of up to 160kg, and then specify the integrated front rack.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/riese_muller_nevo3_gt_vario_review_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Whichever option is best suited to your needs, the base remains the same – an open-design aluminium frame with integrated motor and battery.</p>\n<p>That step-through frame means the bike is more accessible because it makes it easier for those with mobility issues to get on and off – not to mention those who are obliged to cycle in a skirt. Stepping through the open frame is far easier than trying to swing a leg over the back of the bike.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.r-m.de/en-gb/bikes/nevo3/nevo3-gt-vario/#F00431_05031211\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Riese &amp; Muller Nevo3 GT Vario now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Helping to move everything along, the Bosch motor used by Riese &amp; Müller on the Nevo3 GT Vario is the latest generation of Performance Line CX – the most powerful e-bike motor Bosch produces.</p>\n<p>As for the battery that powers the motor, there are once again multiple choices. You can start by buying a second 500Wh battery for a dual battery set-up or make the upgrade to a better-performing 625Wh battery pack.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/specialized/9429/specialized-como-sl-new-lightweight-e-bike-for-city-cycling\">Specialized Como SL: new lightweight e-bike for city cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/ribble/9551/ribble-launches-a-pair-of-ridiculously-light-e-bikes\">Ribble launches a pair of ridiculously light e-bikes</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/rapha/9388/rapha-classic-collection-relaunched-with-recycled-materials\">Rapha Classic Collection relaunched with recycled materials</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Riese &amp; Muller Nevo3 GT Vario specs</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated weight:</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame material</td>\n<td>Aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Motor</td>\n<td>Bosch Performance Line CX</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Bosch Powerpack 500 Performance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated range</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gearing</td>\n<td>FSA, Gates, Masura</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Selle Royal New Lookin Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bars</td>\n<td>Humbert Ergotec XXL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>Machi 650 29in</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyres</td>\n<td>Schwalbe Big Ben Plus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.r-m.de\" target=\"_blank\">r-m.de</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5baa49e516c5bb0b0323112f0450371fa1fa4bed34daaeffd645c4646aee9f0f","category":"Cycling"}
