Their titanium cookware lasts forever and their compact camping solutions have proven to be excellent allies on bicycle tours so it makes sense that Rapha would pair up with Snow Peak on a capsule collection, live now at their site. Sure, if you already have this gear, you don’t need to be bothered but if you’re a fan of Rapha and are curious about Snow Peak’s legacy, this is for you. I’ve been using the new Kanpai bottle for hot and cold-brewed coffee and its worked a treat.</p>\n<p>See the collection at <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/search/all?text=snow+peak\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ac1988da2e2fd3ec21fd9eda48232f67829a5ca0b41fff174868a57b540d1f67","category":"Cycling"}
