So-called “non-fungible tokens” are having a bit of a moment in recent weeks, attracting <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/nft-boom-vcs-pump-millions-into-digital-collectibles-start-ups.html\">a surge of venture capital cash</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/twitter-ceo-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-nft-sells-for-2point9-million.html\">eye-watering speculative values</a> for traceable digital goods. This despite the fact that most of the general public barely understands how this blockchain-based system of digital authentication works, or why it’s behind <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/beeple-everydays-controversy-nft-or-not-1952124\">people paying $69 million for a single GIF</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fungible? Token?</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the simplest way to start thinking about NFTs is as a digital version of the various “certificates of authenticity” that are <a href=\"https://www.format.com/magazine/resources/art/certificates-of-authenticity\">prevalent in the market for real-world art and collectibles</a>. Instead of a slip of paper, though, NFTs use cryptographic smart contracts and a distributed blockchain (most often built on top of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/ether-soars-above-1000-in-broad-cryptocurrency-rally/\">Ethereum</a> these days) to certify who owns each distinct, authentic token.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752094#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752094&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d9ae74da3f2c8254653c948b7a465e30696f87853bc3bdfc758ae0e25312a6bc","category":"Tech"}
