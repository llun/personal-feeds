This mission will launch from Blue Origin's spaceport in West Texas on July 20, which is the anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. With this timeline, Bezos seemed almost certain to get to orbit before his suborbital, space-tourism rival Sir Richard Branson, whose flight was scheduled for later this summer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772183#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772183&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8eec4e20062bf13447b55750ab8fae2c098053913c6d640ba5c245b126d4479d","category":"Tech"}
