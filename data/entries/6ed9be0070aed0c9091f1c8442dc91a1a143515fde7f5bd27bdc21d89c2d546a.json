Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal.”\n<p>Colonial temporarily halted operations on Saturday, after determining that it was the victim of a ransomware attack. The pipeline runs through 11 states, from New Jersey to Texas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764758#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764758&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ed9be0070aed0c9091f1c8442dc91a1a143515fde7f5bd27bdc21d89c2d546a","category":"Tech"}
