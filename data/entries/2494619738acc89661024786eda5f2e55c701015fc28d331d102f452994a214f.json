The agencies are probing Binance for potential criminal violations, the report says, though the company has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>The investigations come on the heels of a <a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/money-laundering-cryptocurrency-2019\">report by Chainalysis</a> that traced $2.8 billion worth of illicit bitcoin on exchange and trading platforms. Of that, $756 million went through Binance. Most of the suspect accounts received small amounts, but the majority of the illicit cryptocurrency flowed to a few hundred accounts that received between $100,000 to $100 million. Government officials are said to be focused on money laundering and tax evasion.</p>\n<p>The recent ransomware attack <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/colonial-pipeline-resumes-operations-after-ransomware-prompted-closure/\">on the Colonial Pipeline</a> that led to gasoline shortages has sharpened the focus on cryptocurrencies’ role in illegal activities. In that case, it's reported that Colonial paid the attackers <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/colonial-pipeline-paid-ransomware-hackers-5-million-u-s-official-n1267286\">$5 million</a> to return control of the pipeline’s operations. In another, a ransomware gang <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/ransomware-crooks-post-cops-psych-evaluations-after-talks-with-dc-police-stall/\">recently posted personnel records</a> from District of Columbia’s Metropolitan Police Department after the department didn’t cave to their demands of a $4 million ransom. The group, known as Babuk, is behind other ransomware attacks and frequently requests payment in bitcoin.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765146#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765146&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2494619738acc89661024786eda5f2e55c701015fc28d331d102f452994a214f","category":"Tech"}
