{"title":"Lezyne releases new ‘gravel’ mid-volume floor pumps","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/lezyne-releases-new-gravel-mid-volume-floor-pumps/","date":1615940340000,"content":"<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel. The wonderful bicycle industry marketing buzzword has now reached the telescoping world of floor pumps. And while you too may be shaking your head at Lezyne&#8217;s naming convention, the idea of a mid-volume pump makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lezyne’s new Gravel floor pump range consists of three models: the Sport Gravel Floor Drive (US$65), Gravel Floor Drive (US$80), and the Gravel Digital Drive Pro (US$100). All share the same basic concept: a larger barrel that provides a volume optimised for more efficient pumping of tyres that require less than 100 psi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look to the majority of floor pumps on the market today and you’ll likely see the gauges offer a scale of 0-160 psi, with the pump’s volume optimised to allow such extreme pressures to be reached. In turn, that means the volume of air moved with each stroke is greatly compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the opposite end of the scale are a number of “mountain bike-specific” floor pumps, optimised to move large amounts of air before becoming quite hard to push once above 40 psi (or thereabouts).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lezyne’s new floor pumps slot right in the middle, aiming to offer more volume per stroke while still allowing modern road riding pressures of 70-90 psi to be reached. And Lezyne achieves this without volume switches or the need for dual chambers like some more premium options. Equally, the narrower 0-100 psi scale on the gauge means you’re more likely to hit (and see) your intended figure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All three pumps feature <a href=\"https://ride.lezyne.com/products/abs-1-pro-tubeless-chuck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lezyne’s new ABS-1 Pro Tubeless chuck</a>. This is a thread-on chuck with a flippable head that can now thread onto a Presta valve stem with the core removed for easier tubeless inflation. Lezyne has integrated a Presta valve core tool into the chuck for easy use of this feature, and it’ll surely help ensure you don’t get the dreaded accidental valve core removal under normal pumping use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Tubeless chuck is Presta-only – an obvious trade-off. However Lezyne’s pre-existing ABS Flip Chucks – which offer Presta and Schrader compatability – can be swapped in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The base model pump features a large 3.5&#8243; analogue gauge, while the two more expensive versions receive a digital gauge with a 0.5 psi resolution. The two more affordable options feature a reinforced plastic base, while the Pro version earns a full aluminium construction with a wooden handle. As with all Lezyne floor pumps, these new models are fully rebuildable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hunch is that Lezyne will soon have plenty of competition within this mid-volume pump space. It just makes sense that new pumps should be optimised for the larger-volume tyres and lower running pressures that most of us now use across various disciplines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped wp-block-gallery__slider\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"492673\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=492673\" class=\"wp-image-492673\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Sport-Drive-floor-pump.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">A mid-volume pump to better suit modern tyres. </figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"492672\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=492672\" class=\"wp-image-492672\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-Gravel-Digital-Drive-Pro-floor-pump.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">The top-tier Digital Drive Pro offers a full aluminium construction. </figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"492669\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=492669\" class=\"wp-image-492669\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lezyne-ABS-1-Pro-Tubeless-chuck.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">The new ABS-1 Pro Tubeless Chuck can be threaded over Presta valve stems with the core removed.
