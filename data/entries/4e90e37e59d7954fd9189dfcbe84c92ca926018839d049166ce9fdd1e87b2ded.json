{"title":"[Sponsor] Atoms Are Sold Out","link":"https://atoms.com/df-march","date":1614645637000,"content":"\n<p>Hey Daring Fireball readers, many of you are familiar with Atoms, and a lot of you wear our shoes and the comfortable masks we make. We are currently sold out of almost all of our shoes because Humans of New York did an in depth story on our co-founder Sidra’s personal journey. So this week, instead of ordering with Atoms, we would encourage you to <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/aoc-social-20210219?refcode=atomsdotcom\">support relief efforts in Texas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And while you are at it, do read the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidraqasim/status/1354922768219992065\">story at Humans of New York</a>, it is a bit long, but right in the sweet spot you all like. Thanks.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Atoms Are Sold Out’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2021/03/atoms_are_sold_out\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4e90e37e59d7954fd9189dfcbe84c92ca926018839d049166ce9fdd1e87b2ded","category":"Tech"}
