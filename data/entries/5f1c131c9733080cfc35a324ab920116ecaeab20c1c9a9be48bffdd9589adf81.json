{"title":"Looking to Grab a HomePod Before They're Gone? These Retailers Still Have Stock","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/homepod-before-theyre-gone/","date":1615816462000,"content":"Apple last week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">discontinued the original HomePod</a>, marking just over three years on the market for the full-size smart speaker. If you're looking to purchase the larger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> before it's completely gone, there are still some options online today.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/homepod-feature-blue2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1206\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788875\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe biggest retailer with remaining stock on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-homepod/homepod/white\"><strong>Apple</strong></a> itself, which has the White &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; for &#36;299.00 on its website. Space Gray is no longer available.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAt <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/633495/10014?prodsku=5902411&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5902411%2Fpdp&intsrc=APIG_4831\"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a> you can order the <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/633495/10014?prodsku=5902411&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5902411%2Fpdp&intsrc=APIG_4831\">White HomePod</a> for &#36;299.99 with both pickup and delivery options. <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/633495/10014?prodsku=5902410&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5902410%2Fpdp&intsrc=APIG_4831\">Space Gray</a> is also available at &#36;299.99, although it appears limited to local pickup.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNext, <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13717773-1595027191812?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tigerdirect.com%2Fapplications%2Fsearchtools%2Fitem-details.asp%3FEdpNo%3D6005432&cjsku=41677236\"><strong>TigerDirect</strong></a> has stock on both original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; options, with same-day shipping available as well. TigerDirect is selling the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; at &#36;299.00.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAnother third-party retailer with &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; stock is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43979&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expercom.com%2Fview_product_set.html%3FPRODUCT_SET_ID%3D114%26RETURN_URL%3D%2Fpages%2Fsandy\"><strong>Expercom</strong></a>, which has both the White and Space Gray options at &#36;299.00 available to ship today.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/462641/type/dlg/https://datavision.com/products/apple-homepod-wireless-speaker-white\"><strong>DataVision</strong></a> has the White &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in stock, but it's selling the speaker at a high price of &#36;314.00, so it'll be best to shop at some of the other retailers first.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; debuted at a price of &#36;350, but eventually Apple permanently marked the price down to &#36;299. Over the past few years, we did see the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; drop down to between &#36;150 and &#36;200 during holiday sales, with &#36;199 being one of the most popular discount prices since 2018.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOf course, now that it's discontinued, we'll never see these sale prices again and you'll have to pay full price (or more) if you really want to purchase the original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in 2021.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.
