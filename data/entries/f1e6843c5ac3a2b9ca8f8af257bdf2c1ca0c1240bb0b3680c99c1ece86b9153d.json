The ‌iPhone 13‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro will share a battery of 3095mAh, compared to 2815mAh. The smallest model of the lineup, the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, will feature a 2406mAh battery, compared to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>'s 2227mAh. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> devices, the size of the battery only tells a portion of a device's battery story. The other half comes down to the efficiency of the A-series chip and other components. The A15 chip, expected in the ‌iPhone 13‌, will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/09/iphone-13-pro-120hz-refresh-rate/\">improve energy efficiency</a> on top of the larger battery. While the higher-end models of the 2021 ‌iPhone‌ lineup will feature larger batteries, so will the smallest ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, according to this rumor.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone 12 mini‌, which is the smallest ‌iPhone‌ Apple has made to date, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp/\">has performed poorly</a> in sales compared to the other models. One reason may be the smaller battery in the device, leading to struggling all-day battery life. However, Apple seems to be set to address those concerns if this rumor proves to be true. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe larger batteries will also help accommodate the rumored inclusion of a ProMotion 120Hz display in the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max. Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has stated that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">Apple plans to include the ProMotion technology in the highest-end models of the lineup</a>. Compared to the current peak 60Hz, a 120Hz display will use more battery. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/iphone-13-models-larger-camera-bumps/\">Schematics of the upcoming</a> ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup seen by <em>MacRumors</em> indicated that the 2021 iPhones will be thicker in design. Thanks to this rumor, the increase in thickness seem to be due to the larger battery capacities. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/l0vetodream/\">L0vetodream</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/iphone-13-larger-battery-capacities/\">iPhone 13 Lineup Appears to Feature Significantly Larger Battery Capacities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-lineup-appears-to-feature-significantly-larger-battery-capacities.2298753/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZAYDB8dwIHc:LjhST-C4FMI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZAYDB8dwIHc:LjhST-C4FMI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZAYDB8dwIHc\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f1e6843c5ac3a2b9ca8f8af257bdf2c1ca0c1240bb0b3680c99c1ece86b9153d","category":"Apple"}
