{"title":"Internal Letter Circulates at Apple — and Leaks to The Verge — Pushing Back Against Returning to the Office","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook","date":1622865011000,"content":"\n<p>1,400 words to say they’d prefer a policy that allows teams within Apple to determine their own remote work policies. Good communication <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400270458608664577\">is to the point</a>, and this is not to the point at all. No wonder the letter-writer(s) feel “unheard”. It’s hard to get through the whole letter, and if you do make it through, it reeks of self indulgence. Some serious ✊🍆 vibes. The “formal requests” at the end about employees with disabilities and the “ environmental impact of returning to onsite [<em>sic</em>] in-person work” are such transparent pandering. (I have never once heard of Apple not doing whatever it takes not only to accommodate employees with any disability, but to make them feel welcome.)</p>\n\n<p>And who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark? Three days a week on site and two days remote is a <em>huge</em> change for Apple.</p>\n\n<p>Given that these letters <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook\">keep</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook\">leaking</a> to Zoe Schiffer at The Verge, I can’t help but think that the problem for Apple is that they’ve grown so large that they’ve wound up hiring a lot of people who aren’t a good fit for Apple, and that it was a mistake for Apple to ever hook up a company-wide Slack. Companies are not democracies, but the employees writing these letters sure seem to think Apple is one. It’s not, and if it were, the company would sink in a snap. Apple’s new “three days on site” policy wasn’t a request for comments — it was a decision — and Tim Cook’s company-wide letter already leaves room for individual teams to adjust it to their own needs.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/apple-remote-work\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"83ec40938f02ebfb890687e88945c0d3e5930d1503948b2b903afe6c6ff87911","category":"Tech"}
