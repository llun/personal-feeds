Unscramble words using your enchanted language vortex from the multiverse of infinite vocabularinities, collect power-ups from dysenteric deer, and stop your crazy cat-collecting neighbor from destroying your house!</blockquote>There's an extensive single player game that features a story by Inman, along with the option to play 1v1 games with either friends or strangers. Gameplay is free, but there are cosmetic in-app purchases that are available.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKitty Letter can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
