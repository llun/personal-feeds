The figures for 2021 have not been published yet, but they are unlikely to change significantly.</p>\n<p>The 2020 sum included a €500,000 overall prize for champion Tadej Pogačar (Team UAE Emirates), although the Slovenian accumulated far more through the course of the race for stage wins, placings on stages and climbs, and long spells in the polka-dot and white jerseys.</p>\n<p>Riders can earn money from all the main prizes, as well as on categorised climbs, intermediate sprints or even just finishing within the first 160 classified riders in the race.</p>\n<p>All <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/tour-de-france-startlist/\">Tour de France teams</a> have different formulas for sharing the prize money, but usually it’s put into a pot and divided between every rider (and often staff) on the team at the end of the race. Cycling is a team sport with individual winners, after all.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the 2020 Tour de France prize money was broken down.</p>\n<h2>Tour de France stage winner prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The winner of each stage of the 2020 Tour de France wins €11,000.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Broadway/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>The winner of every stage earned €11,000 in 2020, as well as a place on the podium at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Second-place was worth half that, €5,500, while the rider in third raked in €2,800.</p>\n<p>In fact, every rider down to 20th place (€300) earned a share of the €28,650 on offer each day.</p>\n<p>Here’s the full breakdown for each individual stage classification.</p>\n<ol><li>€11,000</li>\n<li>€5,500</li>\n<li>€2,800</li>\n<li>€1,500</li>\n<li>€830</li>\n<li>€780</li>\n<li>€730</li>\n<li>€670</li>\n<li>€650</li>\n<li>€600</li>\n<li>€540</li>\n<li>€470</li>\n<li>€440</li>\n<li>€340</li>\n<li>€300</li>\n</ol><h2>Tour de France yellow jersey prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogacar took home €500,000 for winning the 2020 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Broadway/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>If winning the stage also put a rider into the yellow jersey, there was an extra €500 up for grabs, with the same prize on offer for each day a rider wore the maillot jaune.</p>\n<p>That, however, is small fry compared to the main prize pot for the general classification.</p>\n<p>The rider in the yellow jersey on the final podium in Paris in 2020 won €500,000, with Pogačar taking the spoils in last year’s race. The prize increased in 2016 and has remained the same since.</p>\n<p>Chris Froome (twice), Geraint Thomas and Egan Bernal ensured Team Sky/Team Ineos took the half-a-million top prize from 2016 to 2019.</p>\n<p>Thomas, the 2018 winner, was also second in 2019, earning €200,000, while third place is currently worth €100,000 in prize money. In 2020, Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) and Richie Porte (Trek-Segafredo) finished second and third respectively.</p>\n<p>Each rider from fourth to 19th receives increasingly smaller amounts, while everyone from 20th place to 160th is awarded €1,000 for completing the 3,470km race from Nice to Paris, based on last year’s figures.</p>\n<p>Here’s a full breakdown of the prize money awarded to the ten overall fastest riders in 2020.</p>\n<ol><li>€500,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n<li>€200,000 (Primož Roglič)</li>\n<li>€100,000 (Richie Porte)</li>\n<li>€70,000 (Mikel Landa)</li>\n<li>€50,000 (Enric Mas)</li>\n<li>€23,000 (Miguel Angel Lopez)</li>\n<li>€11,500 (Tom Dumoulin)</li>\n<li>€7,600 (Rigoberto Urán)</li>\n<li>€4,500 (Adam Yates)</li>\n<li>€3,800 (Damiano Caruso)</li>\n</ol><h2>Tour de France King of the Mountains prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In 2020, each day in the King of the Mountains jersey was worth €300.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Broadway/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>Last year, a day in the King of the Mountains jersey was worth €300, while the top eight in the final mountains classification are recompensed at the end of the race.</p>\n<p>The overall winner received €25,000, while second place got €15,000.</p>\n<p>Pogačar also took the King of the Mountains prize in 2020, as well as securing overall victory and, by default, the best young rider.</p>\n<p>Here’s a full breakdown of the prize money awarded to the top eight finishers in the mountains classification in 2020.</p>\n<ol><li>€25,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n<li>€15,000 (Richard Carapaz)</li>\n<li>€10,000 (Primož Roglič)</li>\n<li>€4,000 (Marc Hirschi)</li>\n<li>€3,500 (Benoit Cosnefroy)</li>\n<li>€3,000 (Pierre Rolland)</li>\n<li>€2,500 (Richie Porte)</li>\n<li>€2,000 (Nans Peters)</li>\n</ol><h2>Tour de France climbs prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s also prize money up for grabs at the top of each classified climb.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Broadway/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s not all about the final classification and the polka dot jersey – each <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-climbs/\">climb at the Tour de France</a> has a prize on offer at the top.</p>\n<p>For ‘hors categorie’ and first-category climbs, the first three over the summit earn prize money; on second-category ascents, it is the top two and on third and fourth-cat climbs it is just the first rider over.</p>\n<p>The 2020 Tour de France contained 29 climbs categorised as second category or above – with five in the top HC category. There were also 21 category three and 15 category four ascents.</p>\n<p>The five HC climbs were worth €800 to the first across, €450 to the second and €300 to the third. The 16 category-one mountains offered €650, €400 and €150 respectively.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿</th><th>HC</th><th>1st category</th><th>2nd category</th><th>3rd category</th><th>4th category</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>€ 800</td><td>€ 650</td><td>€ 500</td><td>€ 300</td><td>€ 200</td>        </tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>€ 450</td><td>€ 400</td><td>€ 250</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td>        </tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>€ 300</td><td>€ 150</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>For second-category mountains or hills, the first rider across received €500 and the second €250, while it was €300 to cross a third-category climb first and €200 to be the first over a fourth-category ascent.</p>\n<p>Riders can also boost their pay packets further by being the first across the highest point of the race. In 2020, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange was awarded to the first rider at the top of the 2,304m Col de la Loze on stage 17.</p>\n<p>That added €5,000 to the kitty of Miguel Angel Lopez (Astana) last year.</p>\n<p>For 2021, the Port d’Envalira, which the riders will cross during stage 15 will be the highest point of the race, topping out at 2,408m.</p>\n<p>The Souvenir Jacques Goddet is offered to the first rider to reach the top of the Col du Tourmalet, which will be included in the 2021 edition of the race.</p>\n<h2>Tour de France points classification prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Peter Sagan has cleaned up in the points classification in recent years but Sam Bennett ousted him from the green jersey in 2020.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Whitehead/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>As with the polka dot jersey, a day in the green jersey in 2020 was worth €300 – so that’s a lot of prize money that has headed Peter Sagan’s way in his Tour de France career.</p>\n<p>Even more so when you consider the €25,000 top prize for winning the points classification overall, which Sagan has done in seven of the eight years from 2012 to 2019.</p>\n<p>However, Irish sprinter Sam Bennett (Deceuninck–Quick-Step) ended Sagan’s run in the green jersey in 2020.</p>\n<p>The top eight in the final points classification all win prizes, 2020 was as follows:</p>\n<ol><li>€25,000 (Sam Bennett)</li>\n<li>€15,000 (Peter Sagan)</li>\n<li>€10,000 (Matteo Trentin)</li>\n<li>€4,000 (Bryan Coquard)</li>\n<li>€3,500 (Wout van Aert)</li>\n<li>€3,000 (Caleb Ewan)</li>\n<li>€2,500 (Julian Alaphilippe)</li>\n<li>€2,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n</ol><p>That’s exactly in line with the mountains classification.</p>\n<p>Each intermediate sprint – one on each of the 20 road stages – was worth €1,500, €1,000 and €500 for the first three riders through.</p>\n<p>These prizes are often swallowed up by the breakaway, with the sprinters keeping their powder dry for the stage finishes – the prize money for the top 20 on each stage is detailed at the top of this article.</p>\n<h2>Tour de France young rider classification prize money</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2021 youth classification is for riders born on or after 1 January 1996.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Broadway/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>A €300 prize is also up for grabs for each day in the white jersey of best young rider (in other words, for the 2021 race, those riders born on or after 1 January 1996).</p>\n<p>In addition, the highest-placed young rider on each stage can claim a €500 daily prize.</p>\n<p>The top four riders in the final young rider classification also win prizes, in 2020, €20,000 was up for grabs for the winner with the prize money decreasing by €5,000 for each position in the top four.</p>\n<p>At 21 years old, Pogačar became the youngest Tour de France winner since 1904 by winning the 2020 race and securing the white jersey, as well as the yellow and polka-dot jerseys.</p>\n<ol><li>€20,000 (Tadej Pogačar)</li>\n<li>€15,000 (Enric Mas)</li>\n<li>€10,000 (Valentin Madouas)</li>\n<li>€5,000 (Daniel Felipe

finishers – claims a further €2,800 in prize money.</p>\n<p>Those daily times are all added up to form the overall team classification, and the top-five teams at the end of the race also win big.</p>\n<p>Movistar Team has topped the team classification in five of the last six years (including 2020), winning €50,000 in Paris as a result.</p>\n<p>Here’s a full breakdown of the prize money awarded to the five highest-ranking teams at the end of the Tour de France in 2020.</p>\n<ol><li>€50,000 (Movistar Team)</li>\n<li>€30,000 (Jumbo-Visma)</li>\n<li>€20,000 (Bahrain-McLaren)</li>\n<li>€12,000 (EF Pro Cycling)</li>\n<li>€8,000 (Ineos-Grenadiers)</li>\n</ol><h2>Most aggressive rider classification (combativity prize)</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Marc Hirschi won the super combativity prize for his attacking performance in the 2020 Tour de France.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Whitehead/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>There is one final prize at the Tour de France, with race judges picking their most aggressive rider in each of the first 19 road stages (so every stage except the time trial and the final stage) to win the combativity prize.</p>\n<p>The previous day’s winner can be spotted by their red race number on the following stage, but they will also be €2,000 richer.</p>\n<p>At the end of the race, a Super Combatif award is also handed out – worth €20,000.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Julian Alaphilippe claimed the prize for his efforts in storming into the lead earlier in the race.</p>\n<p>Sunweb’s Marc Hirschi took the 2020 prize for an attacking performance that saw him finish second on stage two, third on stage nine and claim victory on stage 12.</p>\n<h2>How does Tour de France prize money compare to other sports events?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tour’s prize money is not to be sniffed at, but it’s significantly less than some sports events.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Whitehead/ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>While €500,000 for winning the yellow jersey is nothing to be sniffed at, the amount on offer for winning cycling’s greatest race is still comparatively low when placed alongside other sports.</p>\n<p>PDC world darts champion Peter Wright took home £500,000 (around €556,000) when he beat Michael van Gerwen at the Alexandra Palace on New Year’s Day in 2020.</p>\n<p>In horse racing, the Grand National winner receives £561,300 (around €625,000) and the men’s and women’s singles champions at Wimbledon received £2.35 million (€2.61 million) each in 2019.</p>\n<p>Still, the most fabled prize in cycling is not something to turn your nose up at – prize money or not.</p>","author":"Colin
