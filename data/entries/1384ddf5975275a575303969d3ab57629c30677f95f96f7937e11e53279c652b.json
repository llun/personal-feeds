However, they will have better cameras, faster processors, a new port, and—at least in the 12.9-inch model—a new screen technology.</p>\n<p>The biggest surprise in this article is that the new port would be the same one that is found in Apple's laptops: Thunderbolt. Bloomberg's sources say that Apple has been testing versions of the iPad Pro that can connect to more external monitors and other kinds of peripherals because of the inclusion of a Thunderbolt port.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750615#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750615&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1384ddf5975275a575303969d3ab57629c30677f95f96f7937e11e53279c652b","category":"Tech"}
