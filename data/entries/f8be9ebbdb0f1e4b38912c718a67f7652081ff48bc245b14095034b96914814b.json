It’s not a StumpJumper or RockHopper.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06300.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06267.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It’s a STREETSTOMPER! And it does. And I do. Stomp Streets that is. And some gravel roads, too, of course. I bought this bike off craigslist 4 or 5 years ago and immediately put fenders, a super tall and long Nitto stem and mustache bars on it for that sweet poor-man’s X-01 or whatever look.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06223.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06293.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I rode it that way up until this past summer when I wanted to see if I could make it even more comfy for longer and rougher rides. I started by putting some fatter Maxxis DTH 2.3” tires on it and swapping out the tall and long Nitto stem + mustache bars for a more upright adapter + stem combo feat. these wide-boi 52cm Cowchipper “gravel bars.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06221.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06217.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Shimano flat/spd pedals and some parts bin levers (Gran Compes) and seat (Bianchi branded idk what) got my contact points feelin’ nice. Parts bin wheels (Shimano Acera-x), too.</p>\n<p>All of my bikes from the last decade have featured stem shifters and I was keen on keeping that tradition alive so I bought some Sunrace downtube shifter units from my LBS and fixed them to the adapter stem with a cut-up yogurt container shim. The trick to making this work was the Origin 8 cable stops and now I’m shifting in style. Bring the stemmies back!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06293.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06260.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The stoppers are OG Dia Compe cantis and the go-eurs (the derailleurs) are both Shimano units (sis?). I love that they’re all silvery and full metal. The headset is stock and is silver, too. Cup and Cone BB.</p>\n<p>The Sugino VP cranks are all time and they came on the bike!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06300.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, the basket + rack is super nice for my commute and the frame bag holds onto my lock and tools and stuff. On longer weekend rides I put a 300oz bladder in there because I’m a huge fan of water. The front rack is actually a rear rack that I fit to the front end with a little help from a custom bracket I made, and the basket is just zip-tied on as per the rules.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06244.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>That little quarter fender deal was an attempt at keeping the front derailleur and frame bag a little cleaner. With these tires it’s currently the only place I can fit a fender. I’d say it keeps things 25% cleaner than without it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06241.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06232.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>All in all, I feel like over the years the StreetStomper has always been my dream bike – able to be built in tune with my changing ideas and most importantly within a grad student budget!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC06216.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
