Those who want to test the update can sign up on Apple's site. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 brings new customization options for Safari, adding a way to rearrange the different sections on the Start Page like Favorites, Reading List, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Suggestions, Privacy Report, and more. Developers also have access to a new integration to develop features for the Start Page.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe update includes optimizations for using iOS apps on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs. When running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> apps on &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs, there's a Touch Alternatives preference pane to set keyboard commands for touch input alternatives, plus iPadOS apps launch with a larger window if the Mac's display allows for it. Touch Alternatives can be enabled for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps by clicking on the app's name in the menu bar and then selecting the Preferences option. Touch Alternatives let you customize taps, swipes, and drags with keyboard commands. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 adds support for the latest PlayStation 5 DualSense and Xbox Series X/S controllers for use with macOS games.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the Reminders app, reminder lists can be sorted by Due Date, Creation Date, Priority, or Title, and there is an option to print lists by going to File > Print. Reminders can also be moved manually across lists with drag and drop, something that wasn't possible before.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple added a new \"Made For You\" library shortcut in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> for finding personal mixes and Replay playlists, and the Listen Now section has been updated with support for highlighting live events. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's also a new autoplay feature in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app that lets the streaming service to continue to play music after a playlist or music queue ends. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; sources music similar to what's in a person's &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; library, with the feature mimicking the autoplay option added to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/macos-big-sur-apple-music-autoplay.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1174\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784152\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith autoplay enabled, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; audio will not end even after a playlist or album is over. To check that it's on, play a playlist or album and then click on the three dot/line menu button in the upper right hand corner. From there, make sure the infinity symbol is toggled on.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a> app, there's a redesigned &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ tab with a dedicated \"For You\" section and a new Browse tab that makes it easier to browse through available content. The new For You section is designed to help &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ users find favorite magazines and newspapers much faster, plus it adds new tools for managing downloaded issues.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's an updated \"Support\" interface when accessing \"About This Mac.\" The new design includes details on your warranty and it allows for starting a repair right from the Mac interface.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/macos-big-sur-beta-support.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1195\" height=\"697\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784154\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/macos-11-3-homepod-stereo-pairs/\">adds support</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> Stereo pairs, allowing a set of paired HomePods to be set as the default sound output option, with the two HomePods showing up as a single selectable speaker rather than separate as in prior versions of macOS. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCode in the update suggests that the Optimized Battery Charging feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/macos-11-3-optimized-battery-charging-meetings/\">will now make sure</a> the Mac's battery is fully charged before a scheduled calendar event. The Mac will charge to 100 percent three hours before a calendar event's start time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOptimized Battery Charging is designed to preserve the lifespan of the Mac's battery by limiting the amount of time that a Mac sits at 100 percent battery.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn Safari, there's support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/safari-to-support-webm-after-11-years/\">WebM video playback</a>, allowing users to play WebM videos using Apple's browser. WebM is a niche video format designed to be a royalty-free alternative to the H.264 codec used in the MP4 format. WebM allows video files to remain small without sacrificing quality and can be played with little processing power, making it ideal for webpages and browsers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCode in found in the third &zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 beta suggests that Rosetta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/rosetta-macos-11-3-strings/\">could be removed</a> from some &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs in some select regions after the software is released. There's a mention that \"Rosetta is no longer available in this region. Applications requiring Rosetta will no longer run,\" but no additional information is available at this time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are also appear to be new assets that suggest a feature for mapping game controller buttons to keyboard layouts, and there's a Game Center toggle to enable or disable connections with friends, which lets games set you up with your friends or prevents apps from accessing that info.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMore on &zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; can be found in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">our macOS Big Sur roundup</a>.
