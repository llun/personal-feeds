The White House is seeking $7.9 billion for NASA's science programs, including Earth science and missions to explore the Moon and other planets. This represents a nearly 9 percent increase over last year's budget for science programs, with Earth science and planetary science receiving the most significant increases.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768626#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768626&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd610a957fba10eeb20b4a7d2fc1fe0aa6b45ddadf1e99114ad5fe471588398a","category":"Tech"}
