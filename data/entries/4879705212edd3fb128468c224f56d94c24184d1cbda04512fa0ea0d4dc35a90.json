The feature recognizes when other people join or exit a call, adjusting the camera position to fit everyone in.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCenter Stage was designed with third-party video conferencing apps in mind, and Apple has made an API available, which is what Zoom is using. Following today's update, Center Stage will be compatible with the Zoom app for iOS.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>With support for Center Stage, you can participate more naturally in our Zoom video calls. Never again worry about whether you're out of frame during a workout, teaching a class, or celebrating with friends and family over Zoom.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to Center Stage, Zoom is also gaining support for an expanded Gallery View, so those using the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ can see up to 48 video tiles while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> is in landscape mode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMany other ‌iPad‌ models will also get an expanded Gallery View feature that will allow more people to be displayed on a single screen, controllable with pinch zoom gestures.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCenter Stage and expanded Gallery View are available in the Zoom 5.6.6 update, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id546505307\">available from the App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/zoom/\">Zoom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/zoom-ipad-pro-center-stage-support/\">Zoom Adds Support for iPad Pro's New Center Stage Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zoom-adds-support-for-ipad-pros-new-center-stage-feature.2297900/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-hjn6MiCNy0:IRDmvjQQcHI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-hjn6MiCNy0:IRDmvjQQcHI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-hjn6MiCNy0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4879705212edd3fb128468c224f56d94c24184d1cbda04512fa0ea0d4dc35a90","category":"Apple"}
