Instructions are below.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/apple-beta-program.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>On your iOS device, open up Safari and navigate to the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Apple Beta Software Program website</a>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Tap the Sign up button and enter your Apple ID credentials, or sign in with your Apple ID if you've signed up to beta test a previous update.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Agree to the Apple Beta Software Program terms and conditions if required.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>After signing in, you'll see a main screen that's a Guide for Public Betas.

Once you upgrade to iOS 15, an iOS 15 backup cannot be restored to the iOS 14 software, which is why you need to make a backup beforehand. Here's how on macOS Big Sur:\r\n<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Plug your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch into your Mac using the supplied cable.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Open a <strong>Finder</strong> window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Click your iOS device's name in the sidebar.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"http://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/how-to-backup-ios-devices-catalina5.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>If this is the first time connecting your device to your Mac, click <strong>Trust</strong> in the Finder window.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"http://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/how-to-backup-ios-devices-catalina1.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Tap <strong>Trust</strong> on your device when prompted, then enter your passcode to confirm.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>In the General tab, click the circle next to where it says <strong>Back up all of the data on your [iPhone/iPad/iPod touch] to this Mac</strong>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>If you don't want to create an encrypted backup, or you've already set up encrypted backups, click <strong>Back Up Now</strong> at the bottom of the General tab.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"http://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/how-to-backup-ios-devices-catalina.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ol>\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the backup is finished, you can find the date and time of the last backup in the General tab, just above the Manage Backups button.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iOS 15 Features</h2>\r\n<br />\r\niOS 15 is a huge update with tons of new features to explore. There's a Focus mode that helps you stay on task and cut down on distraction, SharePlay features for watching movies with friends over FaceTime, new Privacy settings, and ID card support for the Wallet app, text recognition in images, and new features for apps like Safari, Maps, Weather, and Notes. We have a full overview of everything new in iOS 15 in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">our iOS 15 roundup</a>, and if you're installing iPadOS, we have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">roundup for iPadOS 15 too</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the iOS 15 features are not yet functional and won't be implemented until later in the beta testing period, which is something to be aware of. iOS and iPadOS 15 will be in beta testing for several months as Apple refines and updates the software ahead of its fall release.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-ios-15-public-beta/\">How to Install the iOS 15 Public Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-install-the-ios-15-public-beta.2302841/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bUQ5SIGAK84:sKsLloYSZv4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bUQ5SIGAK84:sKsLloYSZv4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bUQ5SIGAK84\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ad44fc9be6e8526e0361ab5f7166738bac330357f17693c0f4f0a61108e1e3ee","category":"Apple"}
