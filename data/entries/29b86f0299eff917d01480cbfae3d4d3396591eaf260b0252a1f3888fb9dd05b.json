He was sheer perfection in 2016's raunchy, R-rated blockbuster, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)\"><em>Deadpool</em></a>. Reynolds is at his best when he has a strong co-star to play off of as a foil, and he has that in Samuel L. Jackson and Salma Hayek, his co-stars in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman%27s_Wife%27s_Bodyguard\"><em>The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard.</em></a> Yes, it's an awkward title for this sequel to 2017's action/comedy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitman%27s_Bodyguard\"><em>The Hitman's Bodyguard</em></a>. But if you liked that movie (I thought it was a blast), chances are you'll enjoy this latest flawed-but-fun outing.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for first film below. Only mild spoilers for new film; no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p>In the first film, Reynolds plays ambitious, tightly controlled, triple-A rated \"executive protection agent\" Michael Bryce, who finds his professional life in shambles after one of this clients is assassinated on his watch. Two years later, his ex-girlfriend (an Interpol agent) reluctantly hires him to protect hitman Darius Kinkaid (Jackson). Darius is a key witness in the trial of the ruthless dictator of Belarus (Gary Oldman), agreeing to testify in exchange for the release of his con-artist wife, Sonia (Hayek), from prison. Michael has to get Darius from London to the International Criminal Court while being pursued by all the crack assassins and firepower the Belarus dictator can muster. Do they ultimately succeed and save the day against nigh-impossible odds? Do you really need to ask?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774623#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774623&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29b86f0299eff917d01480cbfae3d4d3396591eaf260b0252a1f3888fb9dd05b","category":"Tech"}
