This lines up with a report from Japanese website <em>Mac Otakara</em>, which in January claimed that the number of speaker holes on the new iPad Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/new-ipad-pro-march-launch/\">will be reduced by two thirds</a>, although the reason for this supposed change is unclear.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA two-thirds reduction would work out as follows:<ul><li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro:</strong> 13 holes per speaker → 8-9 holes per speaker</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro:</strong> 17 holes per speaker → 11-12 holes per speaker</li></ul>The new iPad Pro models are still expected to feature four speakers for stereo sound, with two on the top edge and two on the bottom edge.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new iPad Pro models are expected to be equipped with a faster A14X chip that is virtually identical to the M1 chip in the latest Macs. Last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that the new models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/\">could also feature Thunderbolt support</a>, which is certainly plausible given that the M1 chip supports Thunderbolt on Macs. Gurman also expects improved cameras and a Mini-LED display on at least the 12.9-inch model.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>Mac Otakara</em> reported that the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be approximately 0.5mm thicker, whereas the 11-inch model will apparently have the same thickness, further suggesting that a Mini-LED display could be exclusive to the larger model.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new iPad Pro is also expected to support 5G with a Qualcomm modem in cellular models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/esr-airpods-3-case.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"397\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790479\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAs noted by <a href=\"https://iphonesoft.fr/2021/03/23/airpods-3-confirmes-avril-premieres-coques\">French website <em>iPhoneSoft</em></a>, ESR has also listed <a href=\"https://www.esrgear.com/categories/airpods-3-cases/\">new cases for third-generation AirPods</a> that suggest Apple's wireless charging case will be slightly elongated, as previously rumored. The new AirPods are expected to have a similar design as the AirPods Pro, but without Active Noise Cancellation or silicone ear tips to maintain differentiation.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/2021-ipad-pro-fewer-speaker-holes-rumor/\">Next iPad Pro Will Have Fewer Speaker Holes According to Accessory Maker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-pro-will-have-fewer-speaker-holes-according-to-accessory-maker.2289334/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7912FL6f9ow:507WiP5ycaA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7912FL6f9ow:507WiP5ycaA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7912FL6f9ow\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3591f0e21b1e0872143d189d5e80d72d6ffd3274035dce767a9c19cba6234401","category":"Apple"}
