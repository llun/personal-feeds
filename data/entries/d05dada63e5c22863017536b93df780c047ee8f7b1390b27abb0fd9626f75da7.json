It's probably a good idea to grab it, but if you don't use powered USB-C devices the urgency is not as great.</span></p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3609673/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-1122-to-protect-newer-macs-from-bad-usb-c-hubs.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d05dada63e5c22863017536b93df780c047ee8f7b1390b27abb0fd9626f75da7","category":"Apple"}
