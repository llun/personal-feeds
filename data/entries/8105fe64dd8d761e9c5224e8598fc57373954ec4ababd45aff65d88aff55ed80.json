The beavers first chewed through the conduit before chewing through the cable in multiple locations,\" the statement from Telus said, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/beaver-internet-down-tumbler-ridge-1.6001594\">CBC article posted Sunday</a>.</p>\n<p>The beavers apparently used some of the Telus materials to build their dam.
