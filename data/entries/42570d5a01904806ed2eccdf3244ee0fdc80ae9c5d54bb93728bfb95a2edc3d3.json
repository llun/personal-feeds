When it comes to those animals, however, Floridians can truly put the blame on non-natives. Neither pythons nor green iguanas made the Sunshine State their home until we brought them there as pets.</p>\n<p>In fact, there are lots of problematic invasive species that have spread through the pet trade, from predatory fish that can <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/midwest/fisheries/library/fact-snakeheadinvaders.pdf\">drag themselves</a> between bodies of water to a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/mutant-crayfish-got-rid-of-males-and-its-clones-are-taking-over-the-world/\">crayfish that clones itself to reproduce</a>. Those high-profile cases lead to some obvious questions, like whether pets really are more likely to be invasive and, if so, why?</p>\n<p>Two Swiss researchers, Jérôme Gippeta and Cleo Bertelsmeier have now attempted to answer these questions. And their conclusion is that yes, our pets are more likely to be problems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752400#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752400&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42570d5a01904806ed2eccdf3244ee0fdc80ae9c5d54bb93728bfb95a2edc3d3","category":"Tech"}
