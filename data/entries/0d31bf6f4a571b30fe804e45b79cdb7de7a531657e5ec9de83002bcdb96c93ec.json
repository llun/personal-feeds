The Airas are available with a bottom frame if you don't fancy going fully frameless. For a small £25 premium you can get a conversion kit so you can switch between no frame and bottom frame whenever you like.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThere are eight lens tints to choose from as well as two 8KO Iris photochromic lenses – that will set you back another £40 – for an all-day, all-year, all-conditions solution.</p>\n<p>SunGod offers a lifetime guarantee too, so if you do break your glasses, you can get them fixed for free.</p>\n<p>For more information and to buy a pair visit <a href=\"https://www.sungod.co/shop/sunglasses/airas/\" target=\"_blank\">sungod.co</a></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>SunGod Airas Zero Frame</td>\n<td>£130</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SunGod Airas Bottom Frame</td>\n<td>£155</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SunGod Airas + BF Conversion Kit</td>\n<td>£175</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SunGod Airas with Photochromic 8KO Iris Lens</td>\n<td>£170</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9774/sungod-launches-airas-sunglasses-images\">SunGod launches Airas sunglasses images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>21 Jun 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9774%2Fsungod-launches-airas-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=SunGod%20launches%20Airas%20sunglasses%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9774%2Fsungod-launches-airas-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=SunGod%20launches%20Airas%20sunglasses%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9774%2Fsungod-launches-airas-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=SunGod%20launches%20Airas%20sunglasses%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9774%2Fsungod-launches-airas-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9774/sungod-launches-airas-sunglasses-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/lifestyle_on_bike_2.jpg?itok=gCW-FmkO\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/glasses\">Glasses</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0d31bf6f4a571b30fe804e45b79cdb7de7a531657e5ec9de83002bcdb96c93ec","category":"Cycling"}
