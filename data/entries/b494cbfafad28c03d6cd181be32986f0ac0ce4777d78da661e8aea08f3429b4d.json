Cook says that the ‌M1‌ and Apple silicon \"isn't just an upgrade, but a breakthrough,\" while touting Mac's industry-leading customer satisfaction.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple announced at WWDC 2020 that it would embark on a two-year-long transition to its own silicon for its entire Mac lineup, breaking away from Intel. With the launch of the first Apple silicon-powered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> yesterday, Apple now sells four Mac computers powered by Apple silicon. Alongside them, Apple continues to sell a 16 and 13-inch MacBook Pro, 21.5-and 27-inch ‌iMac‌, and the high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>, all with Intel processors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Cook, the four M1-powered Macs now outperform the five remaining Intel-powered computers in its lineup in terms of sales. During the keynote, Cook's comment went largely unnoticed but is likely to be a key point the CEO makes during Apple's upcoming earnings call, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/apple-q2-2021-earnings-report-date/\">which is being held on April 28</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/apple-silicon-mac-sales-intel/\">Apple Now Selling More M1 Macs Than Intel-Based Models, Says Tim Cook</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-more-m1-macs-than-intel-based-models-says-tim-cook.2292569/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cztOb5sJmic:HUql8jwM7gA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cztOb5sJmic:HUql8jwM7gA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cztOb5sJmic\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b494cbfafad28c03d6cd181be32986f0ac0ce4777d78da661e8aea08f3429b4d","category":"Apple"}
