Today the company stopped selling the Google Cardboard VR viewer on the Google Store, the last move in a long wind-down of Google's once-ambitious VR efforts. The message on the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/google_cardboard\">Google Store</a>, which was first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/03/google-finally-stops-selling-cardboard-vr-goggles/\">Android Police</a>, reads, \"We are no longer selling Google Cardboard on the Google Store.\"</p>\n<p>Google Cardboard was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/low-end-vr-playing-with-googles-new-cardboard-headset/\">a surprise hit</a> at Google I/O 2015 and moved the entry point for VR lower than anyone had imagined previously. The device was a literal piece of cardboard, shaped like a VR headset, with special plastic lenses. Google built a Cardboard app for Android and iOS, which would let any suitably high-end phone power the headset. The landscape display split into left and right views for your eyes, the phone hardware rendered a VR game, and the accelerometers did 3-DoF (degrees of freedom) head tracking. There was even a cardboard action button on the handset that would boop the touchscreen with a capacitive pad, so you could aim with your head and select options in a VR environment. Since the product was just cardboard and plastic lenses with no electronics whatsoever, Google sold the headset for just $20.</p>\n<p>After cardboard, Google started to scale up its VR ambitions. In 2016, Google also launched an upscaled version of Google Cardboard, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/google-daydream-review-the-fast-casual-restaurant-of-the-vr-world/\">Google Daydream VR headset.</a> This was a plastic and cloth version of a phone-powered VR headset, with the key improvements of a head strap and a small controller, for $80.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746669#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746669&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"84c67d5f3d948015dc7b736e2705698d3a2a38bbcf8c548225897a0669bd4a46","category":"Tech"}
