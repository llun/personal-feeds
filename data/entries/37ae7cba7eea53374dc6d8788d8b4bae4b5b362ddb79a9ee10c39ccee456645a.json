That $549 pair earned criticism for bugs and its high price but praise for its materials and sound. Apple only recently caught up with demand for the product, and it is not currently working on a second generation of the AirPods Max, though it has discussed launching additional color variations in the future.</blockquote>AirPods Max are currently available in Space Gray, Silver, Green, Sky Blue, and Pink, although <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max-color-combinations/\">interchangeable ear cushions</a> allow for many color combinations. Prior to the AirPods Max being announced, Gurman said Apple also planned to make the headband interchangeable, but the company ultimately decided against that idea.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLaunched in December 2020 for $549, the AirPods Max are high-end wireless over-ear headphones, with key features including premium sound quality with Adaptive EQ, Active Noise Cancellation with Transparency mode, an Apple-designed H1 chip in each ear cup for seamless integration with Apple devices, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/apple-has-discussed-new-airpods-max-colors/\">Gurman: Apple Not Working on Second-Generation AirPods Max, But Has Considered New Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-not-working-on-second-generation-airpods-max-but-has-considered-new-colors.2298248/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0K9LvprcxNk:3uo76Ij9NyU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0K9LvprcxNk:3uo76Ij9NyU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0K9LvprcxNk\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"37ae7cba7eea53374dc6d8788d8b4bae4b5b362ddb79a9ee10c39ccee456645a","category":"Apple"}
