Instead of relying on a single clip or magnet to keep it in place, the hose and bag have a long magnetic strip that locks the hose into place. This increases the area, and therefore chances of reliable hose-fastening when on the move.</p>\n<p>The pack has two zipped compartments, a larger one that includes space for the included 1.5l bladder, two separate organiser pockets and five elasticated straps to keep your various items safe and in place.</p>\n<p>The second zipped pocket is designed for smartphones and has a soft, fleece liner. On each hip strap are elasticated side pockets, and there is an additional Velcro pocket on the back of the bag.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Thule-Rail-Hip-Pack-4l-3-00d56c5.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Internally, there’s plenty of space and organisers for each bit of kit.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Thule-Rail-Hip-Pack-4l-4-b8f5b63.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s a dedicated smartphone pocket.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Thule-Rail-Hip-Pack-4l-2-d790c14.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The magnetic hose attachment strip is a good idea.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe wide waistband is fastened using both Velcro and a clip and has length adjustment.\n<p>In its muted dark slate tone, the Rail should match any riding kit.
