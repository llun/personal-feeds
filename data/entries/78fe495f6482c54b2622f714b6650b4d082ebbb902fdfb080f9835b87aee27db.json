It's the chemistry of choice for a wide range of applications due to its high charge density relative to its mass, which in turn yields things like high-end laptops that can run for more than 10 hours on a single charge while weighing less than four pounds.</p>\n<p>But what about that lead-acid lump hanging out in your car's engine bay? The origins of that battery date back to the mid-19th century, and yet even today you'll still find this archaic tech serving up electrons in the vast majority of vehicles on the road—<a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2020/02/25/tesla-rival-sets-banish-year-old-lead-tech-cars/111368462/\">including EVs</a>.</p>\n<p>In recent years, some automakers have started to make lithium-ion starter batteries available in their vehicles, but the batteries have largely been limited to expensive optional offerings in high-end sports cars from companies like Porsche and McLaren. <a href=\"https://antigravitybatteries.com/\">Antigravity</a> is looking to change that.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741223#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741223&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78fe495f6482c54b2622f714b6650b4d082ebbb902fdfb080f9835b87aee27db","category":"Tech"}
