For instance, you can put in 270g and it will tell you what weighs about that or by what multitude. For instance, 270g is about three times the weight of a deck of cards. Or, my personal favorite, 270g is about the weight of an adult hamster. </p>\n<p>Having light-weight gear is a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/10/condensare-packlist-baileys-mone-hardtail-29er-packed-for-touring-the-northern-new-mexico-cdt/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">game we all like to play</a> and having a light helmet might just make you want to wear it even more, which is a good measure when it comes to something that can save your life. The new POC Ventral Light helmet shaves the unnecessary grams without compromising your safety. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the weight of a hamster on your head, with a retail of $275.
