Each AirTag is a small disc that can be attached to a valuable possession so you can track it with your iPhone if you lose it.</p>\n<p>Each AirTag sends out a Bluetooth signal that nearby compatible devices in the \"Find My\" network detect. When a device detects the AirTag, it reports its location, and you can use the newly rebranded \"Find My\" app to locate it; Apple claims the process is anonymous, secure, and encrypted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759787#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759787&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a2187cae7e9c78f44bc9202f97e7fe432ed5587d8f6eeffc3926c2a84986ea52","category":"Tech"}
