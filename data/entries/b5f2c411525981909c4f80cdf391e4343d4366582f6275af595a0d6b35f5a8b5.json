This would be a big upgrade over the Federal Communications Commission broadband standard of 25Mbps downstream and 3Mbps upstream, which was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/01/fcc-chairman-mocks-industry-claims-that-customers-dont-need-faster-internet/\">established in 2015</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/3mbps-uploads-still-fast-enough-for-us-homes-ajit-pai-says-in-final-report/\">never updated</a> by former President Trump's FCC chair, Ajit Pai.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=2C769043-69ED-426B-B30A-57981A4BA333\">Today's letter</a> was sent to FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and other federal officials by two Democrats, one independent who caucuses with Democrats, and one Republican. Noting that \"the pandemicÂ has reinforced the importance of high-speed broadband and underscored the cost of the persistent digital divide in our country,\" they wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality, including low latency, high reliability, and low network jitter, for modern and emerging uses, like two-way videoconferencing, telehealth, remote learning, health IoT, and smart grid applications. Our goal for new deployment should be symmetrical speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps), allowing for limited variation when dictated by geography, topography, or unreasonable cost.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"We should also insist that new networks supported with federal funds meet this higher standard, with limited exceptions for truly hard-to-reach locations,\" the senators wrote later in the letter. \"For years, we have seen billions in taxpayer dollars subsidize network deployments that are outdated as soon as they are complete, lacking in capacity and failing to replace inadequate broadband infrastructure.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747140#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747140&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b5f2c411525981909c4f80cdf391e4343d4366582f6275af595a0d6b35f5a8b5","category":"Tech"}
