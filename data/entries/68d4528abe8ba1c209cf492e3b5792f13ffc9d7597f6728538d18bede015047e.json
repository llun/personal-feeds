Activity rings, calories burned, workout time remaining, and burn bars will not show up on the TV when streaming workouts with AirPlay 2, but users can still glance at their connected Apple Watch and iPhone or iPad to view that information.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-app/devices/\">AirPlay 2-enabled TVs</a> are available from a variety of brands, including Samsung, Sony, LG, and Vizio. Roku TVs sold by brands like TCL, Sharp, and Hisense also support AirPlay 2, or users can connect a Roku streaming stick to their existing smart TV via the HDMI port as a cost-effective way of streaming Apple Fitness+ workouts via AirPlay 2.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\niOS 14.5 should be released to all users by late March or early April, but anyone can <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">sign up to be a public beta tester</a> for free to access this feature early.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple Fitness+ launched in December, providing subscribers with access to a library of workout videos updated on a weekly basis. The service is currently available in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, with pricing set at &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;79.99 per year after a one-month trial.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay-2/\">AirPlay 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/\">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-fitness-airplay-enabled-ios-14-5-beta-2/\">AirPlay Support for Apple Fitness+ Begins Working in Second Beta of iOS 14.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airplay-support-for-apple-fitness-begins-working-in-second-beta-of-ios-14-5.2285207/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3Pz1Ij5bM5Q:MIIGTnR40KE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3Pz1Ij5bM5Q:MIIGTnR40KE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3Pz1Ij5bM5Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"68d4528abe8ba1c209cf492e3b5792f13ffc9d7597f6728538d18bede015047e","category":"Apple"}
