There, gas utilities had to pay $800 million more than they anticipated during the event, and Minnesota regulators are furious.</p>\n<p>“The ineptness and disregard for common-sense utility regulation in Texas makes my blood boil and keeps me up at night,” Katie Sieben, chairwoman of the Minnesota Public Utility Commission, told <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/22/minnesota-texas-freeze-centerpoint-energy/\">The Washington Post</a>. “It is maddening and outrageous and completely inexcusable that Texas’s lack of sound utility regulation is having this impact on the rest of the country.”</p>\n<p>The gas and electric markets in Texas are lightly regulated and highly competitive, which has pushed companies to deliver energy at the lowest possible cost. But it also means that many companies were ill-prepared when the mercury dropped. To save money, they had skimped on winterizing their equipment. As a result, gas lines across the state—which has about 23 percent of the country’s reserves—quite literally froze. The spot price of natural gas soared to 70-times what it would normally be in Minnesota, and gas utilities paid a hefty premium when they used the daily market to match demand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759766#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759766&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d357076273bd0f470f8f44ee1b608fce4976f9584645e2b7b6756d2011e1bbb1","category":"Tech"}
