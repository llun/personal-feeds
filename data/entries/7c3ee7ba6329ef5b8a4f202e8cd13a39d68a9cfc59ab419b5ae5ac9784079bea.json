Prosus is an investment and holding company, which\nmeans that the most important part of this announcement is that\nStack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the\nexact same team in place that has been operating it, according to\nthe exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don’t\nexpect to see major changes or awkward “synergies”. The business\nof Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance,\nand Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in\nplace: we just have different owners now.</p>\n\n<p>This is, in some ways, the best possible outcome. Stack Overflow\nstays independent. The company has plenty of cash on hand to\nexpand and deliver more features and fix the old broken ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stack Overflow is far from perfect — what isn’t? — but the world would be a far worse place without it, so here’s to hoping that Prosus is a good steward.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/02/stack-overflow-prosus\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7c3ee7ba6329ef5b8a4f202e8cd13a39d68a9cfc59ab419b5ae5ac9784079bea","category":"Tech"}
