This isn't a category of device I was aware of at all before a PR rep reached out to offer a review unit—but once I knew it was a thing, I very much wanted to test it.</p>\n<p>The Wayfarer style that I tested is a neutral, unremarkable style unlikely to get much attention whether negative or positive. They look nicer than gas station sunglasses but without any particular style cue to lead a viewer into thinking they're an expensive designer brand. There's no visual clue about the onboard audio, either—the frames are a touch on the thick side, but unlike <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qoUqax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bose Frames</a>, there's no telltale shape to give the extra functionality away.</p>\n<p>Lucyd Lyte paired with my Pixel 2XL phone quickly and easily. The instructions recommend a two-hour initial charging period; when factory-new and after the initial charging period, the phones are both on and in pairing mode—all you need to do is open the pairing menu on your phone and select \"Lucyd Lyte.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747875#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747875&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0002bbc9dd13501ffa4c11ab728becea857462431a09fb6faae3f36781307349","category":"Tech"}
