Up next on the agenda is a sensory package that\nallows Kiwi to more fully understand the world around it and to\nidentify people and their faces. This becomes important because\neye contact is such an emotive and powerful tool to use in\ntransporting a participant.</p>\n\n<p>Even without the sensing software, I can tell you that the\nexperience of this 2.5ft Groot locking eyes with me, smiling and\nwaving was just incredibly transportive. Multiple times throughout\nmy interaction I completely forgot that it was a robot at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Incredible stuff.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/28/panzarino-disney-groot\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"88d05453a19d1238bb08024158699a40b3017d0af17db2c2985e633568f1284e","category":"Tech"}
