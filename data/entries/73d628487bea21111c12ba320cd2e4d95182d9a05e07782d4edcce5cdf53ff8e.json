As expected, the updates improve the desktop's performance with new processors while maintaining the design we've known iMacs to have for the past couple of years.</p>\n<p>Apple says the new system was designed from the ground up around the M1 system on a chip (SoC), allowing for a much smaller motherboard and cooling system than that seen in the company's earlier Intel-powered iMacs. The new iMac's overall volume is down by 50 percent and comes in at only 11 mm thick, with a single sheet of glass across the entire front of the device.</p>\n<p>The iMac comes with a 4.5K Retina 24-inch display with very small bezels, resulting in a device not much larger than earlier 21-inch iMacs. The new displays also include TruTone technology, which dynamically adjusts color temperature in response to changes in the surrounding ambient light.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1401075#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1401075&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73d628487bea21111c12ba320cd2e4d95182d9a05e07782d4edcce5cdf53ff8e","category":"Tech"}
