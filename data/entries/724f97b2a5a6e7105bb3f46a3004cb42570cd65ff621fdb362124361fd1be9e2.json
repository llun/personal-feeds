This allows you to get all your apps, data, and settings onto your device automatically.</blockquote>For those who have not upgraded past the standard 5GB of storage included with a free ‌iCloud‌ plan, this change should make upgrading to a new device a much more seamless experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple today also announced that its paid ‌iCloud‌ storage plans are now known as ‌iCloud‌+, with new features that include a Private Relay that hides your browsing activity, a Hide My Email option, and a new feature for personalizing an ‌iCloud‌ Mail address with a custom domain name that can be shared among family members.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-icloud-storage-temporary-expansion/\">Apple Temporarily Expands iCloud Storage in iOS 15 for Backing Up Data and Transferring to a New Device</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-temporarily-expands-icloud-storage-in-ios-15-for-backing-up-data-and-transferring-to-a-new-device.2299614/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V0uSckLOYHQ:Fi1eom9bixk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V0uSckLOYHQ:Fi1eom9bixk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/V0uSckLOYHQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"724f97b2a5a6e7105bb3f46a3004cb42570cd65ff621fdb362124361fd1be9e2","category":"Apple"}
