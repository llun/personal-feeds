Garmin Unbound Gravel presented by Craft has partnered with FloSports to show the final 25 miles of the elite men’s and women’s races on Saturday, June 5th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With commentary from Frankie Andreu and Janel Spilkner, the broadcast will start at noon CET on Saturday with shots of downtown Emporia, interviews with riders and spectators, and a glimpse of the All Things Gravel Expo. Additionally, FloSports has agreed to a two-year partnership with Life Time, so this won’t be the only time the gravel event will be broadcast live. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are very excited that FloSports has made the decision to provide this first-time opportunity to bring Garmin Unbound Gravel to the masses for the next two years, which is symbolic of the boom in gravel cycling,” said Kimo Seymour, President of Events and Media at Life Time. “The gravel scene is different from any other kind of cycling, and participants train for Unbound for months after anxiously awaiting to hear the lottery results. For many, it is a bucket list accomplishment. I’m grateful that, through FloSports, viewers from all over will be able to experience our event, celebrate with athletes, and hopefully be inspired to try gravel cycling for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the gravel scene continues to grow and attract professional road athletes and gravel focused athletes alike, live coverage of a gravel event is a huge step for this new discipline of cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“FloSports is honoured to partner with Life Time for Unbound Gravel and we believe this will be one of the most exciting broadcasts this year for fans that love cycling as it marks the first time gravel racing will be produced at this level,” says Ryan Fenton, Director, Global Rights Acquisition at FloSports.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/unbound-gravel-will-have-live-coverage-on-flosports/\">Unbound Gravel will have live coverage on FloSports</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3f28597123c3da1b2eabdd1ff94d0004a89db862f5c687c7b2d324b9438d9c3c","category":"Cycling"}
