Nowadays, a rider must be under the age of 26. However, between 1975 and 1983, the competition was fought out between riders that had been professional for three years or less. From 1983 to 1986, riders were only eligible for the </span><i><span>maillot blanc </span></i><span>if they were competing in their first Tour de France. The modern-day under-26 rule was introduced in 1987.</span></p>\n<p><span>Between the years 1989 and 1999, although the classification still existed, no tangible jersey was awarded to the leader of the competition. This means that three-time winner of the competition Jan Ullrich and two-time victor Marco Pantani never actually wore the white jersey.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Winners of the Young Rider Classification / White Jersey</b></h4>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-990771360-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625651462\" /><em>Andy Schleck in the white jersey battles Alberto Contador in the yellow jersey at the 2009 Tour de France </em></span><em><span>(Image credit: Tim De Waele/Getty Images)</span></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Jan Ullrich, Andy Schleck - 3 </span></li>\n<li><span>Nairo Quintana, Marco Pantani - 2</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Jan Ullrich and <span>Andy Schleck </span>are the only riders to have won the young rider classification three times.
