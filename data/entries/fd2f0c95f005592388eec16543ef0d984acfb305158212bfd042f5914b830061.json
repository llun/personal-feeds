They were also charged with a conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs and aiding and abetting. The racketeering and drug counts each carry maximum penalties of life in prison, the DOJ said. The US is seeking criminal convictions and forfeiture of \"at least $100,000,000\" worth of assets.</p>\n<p>The indictment is available in this <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4adzdj/sky-secure-global-indictment\">Motherboard article</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749746#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749746&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd2f0c95f005592388eec16543ef0d984acfb305158212bfd042f5914b830061","category":"Tech"}
