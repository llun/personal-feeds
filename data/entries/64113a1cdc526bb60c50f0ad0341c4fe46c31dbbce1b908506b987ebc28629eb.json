Pinarello hastily deleted the picture, but you can read our original story below.</p>\n<p>However, we’ve now spotted Carapaz riding the Dogma F14 at the week-long Tour de Suisse, a prestigious stage race in its own right but also used as a form-finder ahead of the Tour de France later this month.</p>\n<p>As we reported in our original story, this looks to be a subtle update to the Dogma. Most notably, the seatstays have been redesigned, perhaps to improve aerodynamics or tyre clearance.</p>\n<p>The down tube has also been reshaped, with the new design stepping down to provide a recess for the bottle cage, before stepping back up as the tube continues towards the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> (the current Dogma steps down twice, slimming as it reaches the bottom bracket). Might this be to improve the Dogma’s stiffness?</p>\n<p>Read on for our original story and what we know about the new Pinarello Dogma so far.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Richard Carapaz is riding the new Pinarello Dogma F14 at the Tour de Suisse.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<hr /><p><em>Original story (published 3 June 2021) continues below.</em></p>\n<p>Will Team Ineos-Grenadiers be riding a new Pinarello Dogma at the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a>?</p>\n<p>That could well be the case. The Italian firm looks set to launch a new Dogma after Team Ineos-Grenadiers rider Richard Carapaz was spotted on an updated version of Pinarello’s flagship race bike.</p>\n<p>Pinarello appeared to tease the new bike on its Instagram account, with 2019 Giro d’Italia champion Carapaz riding a Dogma with an updated seatstay junction.</p>\n<p>Fausto Pinarello, son of the company’s founder, Giovanni Pinarello, was also pictured on a new frame during a rest day ride with Team Ineos-Grenadiers at the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n<p>So is this the new Pinarello Dogma F14? (Pinarello’s naming conventions, with the current F12 being preceded by the F10 and F8, suggest any new bike would be called the F14, but that’s unconfirmed, of course. We’re running with it for now…).</p>\n<h2>Blink and you’ll miss it</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Dogma’s down tube has been reshaped.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-dogma-f12-price-weight-details/\">Dogma F12 was launched in May 2019</a> and this looks like a subtle update – in fact, blink and you’ll miss it.</p>\n<p>The most noticeable change in this latest photo, as we’ve already mentioned, is at the seatstay junction.</p>\n<p>Whereas the Dogma F12’s dropped seatstays leave the seat tube and head directly towards the rear hub, the new frame’s seatstays extend away from the seat tube before kinking towards the wheel.</p>\n<p>While not visible on the most recent photo, last week’s picture of Fausto Pinarello’s bike also showed an update to the down tube. The current F12’s down tube has a double-stepped profile, with the tube stepping down twice as it runs from the head tube to the bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>The new frame appears to step down before the bottle cage area, before stepping back up as the tube continues towards the bottom bracket.</p>\n<h2>Rim brakes remain</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest addition to the Dogma family is likely to be available in both rim brake and disc brake versions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Interestingly, Carapaz is riding a bike with rim brakes, whereas Fausto Pinarello was on a disc-equipped bike.</p>\n<p>Ineos is the only <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour team resolutely sticking to rim brakes</a> and Pinarello looks committed to retaining a rim brake option for its halo bike (along with the disc brake machine), when many other brands (and subsequently their sponsored teams) have made the switch to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a>.</p>\n<p>Ineos is rumoured to be reluctant to switch to disc brakes due to the extra weight of the system on the current Dogma F12. Might this new bike drop enough weight to convince Sir Dave Brailsford and his riders to adopt disc brakes? We’ll see but, with the whole market quickly shifting to discs, it seems an inevitability, whether it’s with this new bike or not.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, it’s business as usual as far as we can tell (and no sign of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-dura-ace-r9200/\">new Dura-Ace groupset</a>), though I’m sure we’ll hear more from Pinarello in due course.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the current Pinarello Dogma F12. As you can see, the seatstays flow directly from the seat tube towards the rear hub. On the updated bike, the seatstays extend away from the seat tube, before kinking towards the wheel. The old Dogma’s down tube also steps down twice towards the bottom bracket.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pinarello</i></span></div>\n<p>We’re yet to see an Ineos rider aboard the new Pinarello in a race, but it’s significant to see Carapaz on the updated bike, even if it’s only on a training ride.</p>\n<p>We normally see a flurry of bike launches ahead of the Tour de France – cycling’s biggest race and, of course, the biggest shop window for bike sponsors – so it’s not inconceivable for a new Pinarello to be launched ahead of the 108th edition, which starts in Brest on 26 June.</p>\n<p>Carapaz is likely to be a member of the Ineos-Grenadiers team supporting <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bikeradar-meets-geraint-thomas/\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas</a> as the Welshman bids for a second Tour de France title.</p>\n<p>New bike or not, Thomas appears to be in fine fettle for the race, winning the fifth stage of the Critérium du Dauphiné (and subsequently finishing third overall, behind team-mate Richie Porte) – one of the Tour’s key build-up races.</p>","author":"George Scott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"64113a1cdc526bb60c50f0ad0341c4fe46c31dbbce1b908506b987ebc28629eb","category":"Cycling"}
