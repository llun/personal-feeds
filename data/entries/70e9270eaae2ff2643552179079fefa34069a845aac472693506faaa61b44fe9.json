There are three different models—<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a>—and we’ve given them all stellar reviews. There’s a strong possibility that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/new-airpods-2020-3780443/\">a new model is on the way</a>, but the current models are fantastic at any price.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods with Wireless Charging Case:</strong> $150 ($49 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods with Wired Charging Case:</strong> $119 ($40 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods Pro:</strong> $190 ($59 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Wireless-Charging-Case-AirPods/dp/B07PYLKTD8?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods Wireless Charging Case: </strong>$67 ($12 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple TV 4K</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-tv-4k-2021-a.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple TV 4K doesn’t often go on sale and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347379/apple-tv-4k-review-2.html\">the new model with the excellent Siri Remote</a> only just went on sale last month, so even these small discounts are noteworthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0933D3SN6/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple TV 4K (32GB):</strong> $169 ($10 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0933D8TNB/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple TV 4K (64GB):</strong> $190 ($9 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Michael Simon/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will release a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348953/2021-apple-watch-series-7-watchos-8-design-display-colors-processor-features-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> in the fall, but we highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234682/apple-watch-series-6-review.html\">the current Series 6</a> in any color (though we’re partial to red and blue). The flagship Apple Watch has a blood-oxygen sensor, EKG sensor, and an always-on display, along with a gorgeous design. It’s pricey, but if you can grab it for less we recommend it over the SE or Series 3 models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm):</strong> $320 ($79 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm):</strong> $350 ($79 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5R3K3Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm w/Cellular): </strong>$429 ($70 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5FXJN7/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm w/Cellular):</strong> $445 ($84 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ipad-air-2020.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Jason Cross/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345539/11-inch-ipad-pro-vs-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-m1-ram-liquid-retina-xdr-display-storage-price-accessories.html\">newest iPad Pro</a> is speedy and gorgeous, but we highly recommend the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/2021-mac-mini-design-processor-m1x-gpu-ram-storage-price-release.html\">iPad Air</a>, which has a similar design, processor, and functionality for a lot less than the flagship model. The entry-level model is also a solid deal at less than $300. We don’t recommend the iPad mini at this time since there could be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348867/ipad-mini-apple-processor-design-price-release-html.html\">a dramatic redesign</a> on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>10.2-inch iPad (8th generation):</strong> $299 ($30 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J62F1RH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>iPad Air (Blue): </strong>$539 ($60 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/12-9-inch-iPad-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-Cellular-128GB/dp/B0932DZPW2?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro (256GB):</strong> $1,099 ($100 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-12-9-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B08HCL483Z/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Magic Keyboard for 12.9-inch iPad Pro (compatible with M1):</strong> $256.45 ($92.55 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/macbook-pro-touchbar-2019.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s M1 Macs are fast and incredible, so we recommend getting one over any other Intel Mac.
