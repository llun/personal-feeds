The dates for each state differ, and the selection of states this year is relatively small. Only purchases made during a state's specific holiday are free of state sales tax.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe policy around each state also varies. Alabama, for example, which is holding its sales-free tax holiday between July 16 and 18, requires that the total sales price of all items must remain under $750. Apple products, including Macs, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a>, are eligible, alongside accessories such as keyboard, mice, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, and more. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMissouri, which is running its holiday between August 6 and 8, has a higher limit of $1500 and the addition of more accessories, including printers, routers, RAM upgrades, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, and more. South Carolina, sharing a holiday with Missouri, has no limit and includes tax-free purchases of earbuds, headphones, and flash drives, however only for students. Virginia consists of a limit of only $60 for cell phone chargers and batteries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore information on Apple's sales tax holiday, participating states and products, can be found on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/campaigns/tax-holiday\">Apple's website</a>. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/apple-sales-tax-hoildays/\">Apple Participating in Sales Tax Holiday for Select U.S. States</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-participating-in-sales-tax-holiday-for-select-u-s-states.2303744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hn9uE3jIqwY:LimHaXKeaYI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hn9uE3jIqwY:LimHaXKeaYI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hn9uE3jIqwY\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a1b4a487382e7c74739f3c43c7fc261722f4f5e12a9bdf259de106855c1a2910","category":"Apple"}
