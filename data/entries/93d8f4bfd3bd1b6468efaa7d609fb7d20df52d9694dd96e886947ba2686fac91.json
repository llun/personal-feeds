Typically, these wireless noise-canceling headphones retail for $80.</p>\n<p>While we haven't formally reviewed the Soundcore Life Q30s on Ars, we have tested them and found them to be a rare value among sub-$100 wireless headphones. In short,Â the Q30s serve up a lightweight and well-padded design, with tremendous battery life that pushes 40 hours per charge, multidevice pairing, and USB-C charging.</p>\n<p>Don't expect the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\">noise-canceling strength of Sony's WH-1000XM4</a>, but what's here is still effective for the price and plenty capable of reducing a good chunk of external noise, particularly low-end sounds like jet or bus engines. Along those lines, the Q30s' bass-heavy sound won't be for everyone, but Anker makes it possible to tinker with the sound profile through a dedicated app. Anker recently launched a successor to this pair <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3v98pUd\" target=\"_blank\">called the Soundcore Life Q35</a>, promising better mic performance and wider Bluetooth codec support, but the headphones currently retail for $130. If you're looking to stay well under $100, the Q30 remains an excellent value.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771368#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771368&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93d8f4bfd3bd1b6468efaa7d609fb7d20df52d9694dd96e886947ba2686fac91","category":"Tech"}
