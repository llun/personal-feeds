There is, of course, a possibility that COVID will throw a spanner in the works again, but this year that was because it came as a bit of a surprise rather than anything else. it's more likely than not to take place between those dates.<br /><br /><strong>Excellent. It's in the Filofax. Where will the Tour de France start? Somewhere that isn't France again?  </strong></p>\n<p>Sadly not. It was supposed to begin in Copenhagen but the 2020 European Championships being postponed by a year means Denmark's capital will now be hosting a round of 16 match on that Monday. It might have been about the long-running feud between football and cycling fans, but it was probably just down to not having enough hotel rooms.<br /><br />Don't worry, the Tour will get its Scandinavian a start, just in<span> </span><a href=\"https://letourcph.dk/en/stages\" target=\"_blank\">2022 instead</a>. In 2021 we'll be setting off from Badger country, Brittany. That's in the North West of France, for those of you who weren't dragged there on family holidays as ungrateful children.</p>\n<p>Stage 1 starts in the port of Brest, heads south, wiggles around a bit and finishes in Landerneau, atop a climb which, to the best of our knowledge, hasn't featured in the Tour de France before. The <em>Coté de la Fosse aux Loups</em> is a short but steep little climb, which means the first maillot jaune of the race will go to a rider who packs a punch. No prizes as to which rider springs to mind there.<br /><br />A rider who isn't Julian Alaphilippe who would probably also volunteer cheerfully for that responsibility is Groupama FDJ's Valentin Madouas. Madouas is not only from Brest originally but still lives locally and is currently<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/segments/2763691\">9th on Strava for the climb</a>. <br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20200830TDF6001-Presse_Sports_Bernard_Papon_1024x1024.jpg?v=1605633278\" /></p>\n<p><strong>That was a little more than I asked for, but thanks, I guess. So the race starts in Brest. What else is going to be going on in the first week?</strong></p>\n<p>Not a lot really. As we said, it's a traditional route, to the point of being practically retro, with the whole of the first week serving as a de facto transition between the Grand Départ and the Alps. It's a mixture of the hilly and the flat, so expect a whole load of grumbling on Twitter from people who get paid to watch cycling about how boring it all is.  </p>\n<p>We do have a return to the Mur de Bretagne - where Dan Martin famously didn't go too soon in 2018 - on Stage 2 to look forward to, and there's the longest first week individual time trial since 2008 as well.<br /><strong><br />Alright, I can see you've been desperately holding back. Tell us about those time trials, then.</strong></p>\n<p>What, so you can make sure you're not in to watch them?</p>\n<p>The total distance that will be ridden against the clock is 58 kilometres. That's the most since 2013, when Chris Froome won his first of four Tour titles.<br /><br />Both time-trials will be as flat as the proverbial pancake. Which makes these proper, boring time trials, just like in the old days, around a vineyard or some such. Not these interesting, new fangled ones where the riders switch to their road bikes halfway round because they're really secret hill climbs in disguise.</p>\n<p><span>In another nod to tradition, the organisers have once again opted to schedule the second, marginally longer of the two, for the penultimate day of the Tour. Just as Primoz Roglič of Jumbo Visma did this year, as he crosses the line the last rider on the road, dressed in a snazzy yellow skinsuit will know whether he has done enough to parade it through the streets of Paris 24 hours later. <br /></span><br />If you've not been paying attention you should immediately conclude that this puts the heavier, more powerful riders more firmly in the frame for the overall. You wouldn't necessarily be incorrect with that assessment, because it should give them more of a chance, but it does also rather assume that these lightweight youngsters can't hold their own on a TT bike. Which they can. UAE Team Emirates' Tadej Pogačar, you'll remember, was ahead of Primož Roglič on time even more before they started climbing La Planche Des Belles Filles, while little Remco Evenepoel - more about him later - came second in the Worlds TT in 2019, and won the same year's Euros title.</p>\n<p>As for the stages themselves, Filippo Ganna would be the obvious candidate to win both... until he announced he'd be concentrating on the Giro and Olympics instead of the Tour. That means Geraint Thomas and Wout Van Aert, second and fourth in the World Championships ITT in 2021 respectively, will be among the favourites for the ITTs.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\" target=\"_blank\">Support our race coverage.

Yes! Can we use that passing mention as a convenient segue to start talking about them?<br /><br /></strong>We can.<br /><br /><strong>Well, go on then...</strong></p>\n<p>Right, well the first thing to mention is that because this year the Tour travelled in a clockwise direction around France, in 2021 it will be going anti-clockwise. It's not a hard and fast rule, but it means the race tends to alternate the order in which it takes on the Alps and the Pyrenees. <br /><br />The difference that makes is that the Alps, as well as being more visually spectacular, is generally thought of as containing the more challenging climbs. What that means is, in theory at least, it ought to be easier to establish a lead in the Alps and defend one in the Pyrenees, which is where the race will reach its crescendo in 2021. </p>\n<p>Here's an interesting fact for you: All four of Chris Froome's Tour de France victories have come when the race visited the Alps in the final week. </p>\n<p><strong>That <em>is</em><span> </span>an interesting fact. </strong></p>\n<p>Our sarcasm alarm is screaming right now.</p>\n<p>Anyway, before the Pyrenees, we have the really fun stuff, starting with the Tour's first time up the Signal d’Uchon on the Friday of week 1. Described by the organisers as \"a spicy finish,\" over its entire 5.7km length the climb averages a fairly pedestrian 5.7%. That average is skewed somewhat by the better part of a kilometre of descending before the final ramp. The two kilometres up to the line averages 12.8%, with stretches in the high teens, which will offer opportunities for anyone after a stage win, or a GC challenger looking to snatch a few seconds. The maillot jaune could well be on the shoulders of a serious contender by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>That stage will merely be an <em>amuse bouche</em> for what's to come, however, with the weekend where we should really see who's got it, and who hasn't. <br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_PP_ET08_La_Colombiere-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1605633742\" /><br />There we'll have three serious climbs on the Saturday with another set of the same on Sunday. The profile of the former is almost identical to that of 2018's stage 10. That was the day Julian Alaphilippe left his breakaway companions behind on the Col de Romme, and soloed over the Col de la Colombière to take the stage by more a minute. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/giro-ditalia-2021-preview\"><em><strong>Related – Giro d'Italia 2021 Preview</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>If Stage 8 should serve up some breakaway action, Stage 9 ought to be where we see the general classification battle begin in earnest. After four far-from-trivial climbs in the opening 100k, the first true summit finish of the 2021 Tour will take place in Tignes. That's where Stage 19 of the 2019 Tour would have ended were it not rudely interrupted by a hailstorm that brought half the hillside down with it. Let's hope this time they make it to the end of the 21 kilometre climb.</p>\n<p>There's only one thing to talk about in the second week - Ventoux.    </p>\n<p>For reasons known only to themselves, the Tour organisers don't actually seem to like the Giant of Provence very much, which might explain why this stage has been plonked on a Wednesday, and why it's been five years since the race returned to the moonscaped mountain.</p>\n<p>Even so, you're going to want to block out the afternoon for this one.</p>\n<p>For the first time in its history, the race is taking it on twice in the same stage. It will also be the first time a Ventoux-featuring stage has not finished at the summit since 1994. On that occasion the 197cm tall<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/rouleur-podcast-eros-poli-and-david-millar\" target=\"_blank\">Eros Poli</a> pulled off one of the most surprising Tour De France wins ever. After building up a lead of more than 20 minutes over the peloton, he was able to hold onto enough of it to crest the climb in front<span> </span>of the bunch, before<span> </span>descending to victory alone. History<span> </span>probably won't repeat itself next July, but it<span> </span>might.<br /><br /><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/mont-ventoux-fear-and-the-mountain?_pos=1&amp;_sid=8140321e8&amp;_ss=r\" target=\"_blank\">Read more - Mont Ventoux: Fear and the Mountain</a></strong></em><br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Mont-Ventoux_002_1024x1024.jpg?v=1605633871\" /></p>\n<p>The second weekend sees the Tour aim for Andorra, the principality only a princeling<span> </span>could love. It's more about the journey than the destination, however, with Stage 16 offering up a relentless day of ups and downs. </p>\n<p>And it's when the Souvenir Henri Desgranges will be awarded, to the rider who leads over the Port d'Envalira - the highest point in the 2021 Tour de France at 2408m of altitude. One much more modest climb after that before the arrival in Andorra, where the riders can enjoy a well-earned rest day of watch-buying and tax avoidance.</p>\n<p><strong>That was pretty comprehensive. Do you think you can breeze through the final week?</strong></p>\n<p>Probably not, but we'll try. The Tour de France 2021 has a conspicuous absence of summit finishes. Not none, but far fewer than we have come to expect in recent years. That's going to be a good thing for those who think they tend to <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-column-enough-of-summit-finish-snooze-fests\" target=\"_blank\">neutralise proceedings up to that point,</a> less so for those who look forward to them. </p>\n<p>Both stages 17 and 18, the race's final days in the mountains, do both end at the top of climbs. The 16km Col du Portet is described by the organisers as \"unforgiving\" and with an average gradient close to 9%, it's not hard to see why. This will be only the second time the race has ever been to its peak - the first was in 2018, when a reinvigorated Nairo Quintana - how many times have we said that before? - soloed to a memorable stage win.</p>\n<p>Stage 18, the climbers' last hurrah, is a beast. Any rider lacking confidence in their aero is going to have their eyes on the very last climb of the race, the 13 kilometre Luz Ardiden. It's a hill that hasn't seen Tour de France action since Samuel Sanchez won there in 2011. It won't be where the 2021 Tour de France is won, but it could be where it's lost.<br /><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/577999_tdf_089_1024x1024.jpg?v=1605633997\" /><br />Phew, that sure sounds like a lot of climbing. Anything for the speedy bois?</strong></p>\n<p>Firstly, does anyone really say \"phew\" or is it something that's just written for comedic effect? Secondly, \"speedy bois\"? Really?</p>\n<p>If you mean the sprinters, it's hard to say at this point. Eight of the 21 stages are classified as \"flat\". It's unlikely that all eight will be suitable for the thoroughbreds, but five or six should be straightforward enough for sprinters' teams between them to keep the break under control, before setting their fastmen up for the finish.</p>\n<p>Unless something unlikely happens between now and then, it ought to be another two-way tussle between Sam Bennett and Caleb Ewan for the unofficial title of fastest man in the peloton. Each have won on the Champs-Élysée in the last two editions of the Tour. Best of three, then?</p>\n<p><br /><strong>So you may not <em>know </em>who's going to win, but who do you <em>think</em> stands a chance?</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, so the most obvious names are those of the reigning champion, and the rider he denied at the last: Tadej Pogačar and Primož Rogli<span>č</span>. The time trial kilometres might swing the advantage back towards the older Slovenian, but Roglič has now shown on several occasions that he struggles to maintain the necessary form to compete at the highest level for a full three weeks. </p>\n<p>Egan Bernal will not aim for the Tour this season, instead heading to the Giro d'Italia for the first time. Richard Carapaz has a claim to lead the INEOS Grenadiers, but so does <span>Tao Geoghegan Hart </span>who is now a Grand Tour winner. However, Geraint Thomas could easily argue that the time trials make the course better suited to him. What do you say, Dave? One last shot at the belt for the Brit?<br /><br />At least Chris Froome won't be a complication this time round. Not for Ineos at least. Though Israel Start-up Nation signed him as the presumptive leader, his effective invisibility at La Vuelta will have raised doubts as to whether he can realistically achieve the form required to compete at that level. Talk is already of he and Dan Martin lining up as co-leaders of Israel Start-up Nation. Still, as tempting as it might be to rule him out, if ever there was a course that a Froome firing on all cylinders could win on, it's this one.<br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_582850_tdf_132_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1605634134\" /><br />What will Remco do? Well, nothing. Not at the Tour at least. The Belgian prodigy is still working his way back to fitness after crashing at Il Lombardia, and is aiming for the Giro, not the Tour de France. Deceuninck-Quick-Step will instead focus on World Champion Julian Alaphilippe.</p>\n<p>Further down the list of favourites, other names worth mentioning include Simon Yates, who will have no twin on his team to send in his stead, Miguel Ángel López, who now rides for Movistar, and Wilco Kelderman.</p>\n<p>This should not be taken as anything remotely resembling betting tips, and Rouleur takes no responsibility for any gambling losses you may incur.</p>\n<h4>The Tour de France 2021 Route</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_VISUEL-CARTE_30x40_AVEC_HABILLAGE-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1605631979\" /></p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 1 (<span>Brest &gt; Landerneau</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage1_1024x1024.png?v=1615223983\" />The Tour de France 2021 gets underway in France's North-Western corner of Brest. Riders will perhaps be more used to a flat stage or prologue to kick-off the festivities, but this year's route begins with a difficult stage that could suit a multitude of riders. The final kilometers are uphill which means we could see a puncher move into the coveted yellow jersey.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 2 (<span>Perros-Guirec </span><span>&gt; Mûr-de-Bretagne Guerlédan</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage2_1024x1024.png?v=1615224020\" />The second stage features less overall climbing metres than stage one (2000m compared to 2600m) but finishes on the Mûr-de-Bretagne. The climb is just 2km but averages 7% with steeper pitches. This one is for the pure punchers and Julian Alaphilippe will undoubtedly have his eyes on the maillot jaune.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 3 (<span>Lorient</span><span> </span><span>&gt; Pontivy</span>)</h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage3_1024x1024.png?v=1615224034\" /></div>\n<div>\n<p>Stage three is intriguing as it could go in a multitude of directions. The sprinters still wait for a pure sprinting day, but the stronger sprinters could well target this stage. The rolling terrain could make it difficult to control, but will a breakaway be treated to a stage so early in the Tour?</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 4 (<span>Redon </span><span>&gt; Fougères</span>)</h4>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage4_e8653c63-84aa-4191-9745-d5b5b14305bf_1024x1024.png?v=1615224055\" /></div>\n<p>Stage four to Fougères is far from pancake flat but will be targeted by the sprinter’s teams. Should they have not stolen any previous opportunities, the quick men will have their first chance to dance at this year's Tour de France.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 5: ITT (<span>Changé </span><span>&gt; Laval Espace Mayenne</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage5_7c1d0479-c4bd-4d13-9d24-f7507f9a88b0_1024x1024.png?v=1615224077\" />Perhaps the GC favourites can have a day off on stage four, though they will need all their energy here. At 27km, we could witness some early time gaps form among the GC favourites. With a flatter stage to follow, the sprinters will switch on cruise control.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 6 (<span>Tours &gt; Châteauroux</span>)</h4>\n<p><br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage6_1024x1024.png?v=1615224122\" />With fewer than 1000m to climb across the day, this is the flattest stage thus far. Another for the sprinters to target.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 7<span> </span>(<span>Vierzon </span><span>&gt; Le Creusot</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage7_1024x1024.png?v=1615224156\" />The most challenging stage of the race to this point. The peloton must be prepared for a long day in the saddle with 248km to cover. The first part  of the stage is mostly flat, but the Côte de la Croix de la Libération (2.5km @ 7.3%), Signal d'Uchon (5.7km @ 5.6%) and the Côte de Montcenis (2.5km @ 5.1%) will cause mayhem to ensue. Perhaps a day for the breakaway as a long day could make it difficult for the peloton to control. We may even see GC contenders try to steal some time too.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 8 (<span>Oyonnax</span><span> </span><span>&gt; Le Grand-Bornand</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage8_1024x1024.png?v=1615224178\" />At this stage, we could well have a well shaken battle for the yellow jersey, with some contenders gaining and losing large amounts of time. That is without any <em>real</em> mountains, until now. The Col de Romme (9.1km @ 8.9%) and the Col de la Colombiere (7.4km @ 8.5%) are the longest climbs in the race so far and are excruciatingly steep. A 15km descent to Le Grand-Bornand follows the final peak of the day. </p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 9 (<span>Cluses </span><span>&gt; Tignes</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage9_eea883b5-4c85-4699-8024-41d21ebbd1c2_1024x1024.png?v=1615224203\" />A monster. <span>The</span><span> Monteé de Tignes is demanding even for the </span><span>most capable</span><span> climbers in the world at 20.9km and an average gradient of 5.6% </span>will decimate the peloton. It's too early for the Tour to be won at this stage, but it could definitely be lost here. The first rest day will be very much required after this...</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 10 (<span>Albertville </span><span>&gt; Valence</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage10_1024x1024.png?v=1615224858\" />A good chance for the sprinters follows the first rest day. They'll have to climb for that chance, though the majority of the uphill roads take place earlier on so we can expect a mass-sprint here.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 11 (<span>Sorgues </span><span>&gt; Malaucène</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage11_1024x1024.png?v=1615224883\" />Two ascents of Mount Ventoux for the first time in Tour de France history. A descent to the line in Malaucène means those that are brave enough to attack must be competent descenders. Over 4600 vertical metres and 200km of road mean a long-day in the saddle, too.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 12 (<span>Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux </span><span>&gt; Nîmes</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage12_8c086708-487b-4e1b-ac06-ab1c368ca9a5_1024x1024.png?v=1615224899\" />A rolling day which the breakaway specialists could target. 2000 metres of climbing could make it difficult for some of the pure sprinters to get to the line, which in parallel makes it an even more enticing opportunity for those that can deal with the climbing.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 13 (<span>Nîmes </span><span>&gt; Carcassonne</span>)</h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage13_1024x1024.png?v=1615224919\" /></div>\n<p>Another rolling day where we could see either the breakaway or a reduced bunch sprint decide the win. The GC battle takes a breather before the final week.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 14 (<span>Carcassonne </span><span>&gt; Quillan</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage14_7d03cd77-4d1f-44f4-9a12-f20a65820a05_1024x1024.png?v=1615224944\" />An interesting day which won't be the first to be highlighted by the GC contenders, but could well play it's role in the battle for yellow. The final climb is the Col de Saint-Louis (5.1km @ 6.8%), but over 15km of descending to the line could deter any attacks from the main GC protagonists.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 15 (<span>Céret </span><span>&gt; Andorra la Vella</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage15_1024x1024.png?v=1615224963\" /></p>\n<p><span>The race has now made it to the Pyrenees, and in case the riders had forgotten, 4500 metres of climbing will certainly be enough to remind them. The theme of few mountain-top finishes continues, though, with a 14km descent following the Col de Beixalis. The peak of this climb also has a time bonification, where the first three riders will receive time bonuses, incentivising the GC contenders to attack.</span></p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 16 (<span>El Pas de la Casa</span><span> </span><span>&gt; Saint-Gaudens</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage16_270b5268-9e9e-4358-9f1f-35f9c1d23488_1024x1024.png?v=1615224982\" /><span>The battle of the Pyrenees goes on, but this could be the final 'day off' for the GC favourites. The Col de Port and the Col de la Core are punishing — both are over 14km — but are too far from the line to see any significant attacks in the GC. A chance for the breakaway, perhaps...</span></p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 17 (<span>Muret </span><span>&gt; Col du Portet</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage17_1024x1024.png?v=1615225029\" />A mountain-top finish! They are few and far between at this year's race, but the final to stage 17 will be crucial. Firstly the Col de Peyresourde and the Col d'Azet, but the real show will be on the Col de Portet. A climb synonymous with the Tour de France, 16.3km at 8.6% gradient will definitively show who is feeling the best.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 18 (<span>Pau </span><span>&gt; Luz Ardiden</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage18_1024x1024.png?v=1615225055\" />The final mountain-top finish of the 2021 Tour de France. The Col du Tourmalet, where Thibaut Pinot won in 2019, will be the prelude on this occasion. That is followed by the Luz Ardiden which isn't quite as long at 13.4km. The climbers will desparately look to gain time in the GC with a time-trial still looming.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 19 (<span>Mourenx </span><span>&gt; Libourne</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage19_1024x1024.png?v=1615225076\" /><span>The remaining sprinters have their penultimate chance here with a flat stage to Libourne. For the GC men, the legs will be truly sapped following the Pyrenees, they'll sit up and conserve for their final effort tomorrow.</span></p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 20: ITT (<span>Libourne </span><span>&gt; Saint-Émilion</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage20_ac042b73-ca43-413c-9000-419b9576e884_1024x1024.png?v=1615225092\" />This is it. The final chance for the general classification riders to make their move. They'll have to do it on the time-trial bike, 31km is enough to create some major time gaps. We will know who will win the Tour de France following this stage.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 21 (<span>Chatou </span><span>&gt; Paris Champs-Élysées</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage21_1024x1024.png?v=1615225118\" /></p>\n<p>The most prestigous sprint in cycling.
