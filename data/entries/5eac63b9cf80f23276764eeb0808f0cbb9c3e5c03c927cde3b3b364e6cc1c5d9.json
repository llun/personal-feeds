Several ODMs have already halted their production for many AIO PCs because of component shortage, but ‌iMac‌ production remains unaffected, the sources said.</blockquote>Apple is selling three all-new built-to-order ‌iMac‌ tiers, priced at $1,299, $1,499, and $1,699. All tiers come in several color options and include Apple silicon <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> processors, solid-state storage, 8GB of RAM, and two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Pre-ordered iMacs begin shipping from May 21.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Digitimes Research, HP was the largest AIO PC brand in the fourth quarter of 2020, shipping 925,000 units, followed by Apple with 860,000 units, and Lenovo with 731,000 units. However, Apple's shipments are estimated to have surpassed HP in the first quarter of 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThat said, overall Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/apple-ipad-mac-supply-shortages/\">says</a> it expects to be impacted by the chip shortages, and predicts a sequential decline of approximately $3 to $4 billion revenue in the third-quarter of 2021 due to ‌‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>‌‌ and Mac supply constraints. Apple says a combination of the shortages and a very high level of demand for both ‌‌‌iPad‌‌‌ and Mac is expected to impact revenue in the second half of 2021.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/apple-to-overtake-hp-all-in-one-pc-vendo/\">Apple 'Likely' to Overtake HP as Leading All-in-One PC Vendor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-overtake-hp-as-leading-all-in-one-pc-vendor.2294890/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RSp3J9QN1lQ:keJtrPMFVAM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RSp3J9QN1lQ:keJtrPMFVAM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RSp3J9QN1lQ\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5eac63b9cf80f23276764eeb0808f0cbb9c3e5c03c927cde3b3b364e6cc1c5d9","category":"Apple"}
