The ads embed JavaScript that surreptitiously exploits software flaws or tries to trick visitors into installing an unsafe app, paying fraudulent computer support fees, or taking other harmful actions. Typically, the scammers behind this Internet scourge pose as buyers and pay ad-delivery networks to display the malicious ads on individual sites.</p>\n<h2>Going for the jugular</h2>\n<p>Infiltrating the ad ecosystem by posing as a legitimate buyer requires resources. For one, scammers must invest time learning how the market works and then creating an entity that has a trustworthy reputation. The approach also requires paying money to buy space for the malicious ads to run. Thatâ€™s not the technique used by a malvertising group that security firm Confiant calls Tag Barnakle.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758113#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758113&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"649762faa7d57b7fb4ca85b7705eae4198605c0065d1ae80792ecdd699efe53f","category":"Tech"}
