In an apparent last-ditch effort to ease concerns highlighted in the report, Apple has provided the commission with some more information surrounding its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and App Review Process.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn a <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/DPB%20-%20March%202021%20Report%20-%20Submission%20-%20Apple%20-%208%20March%202021%20-%20PUBLIC%20FOR%20PUBLISHING.pdf\">submission</a> to the commission, Apple says that it's \"surprised to hear that developers have legitimate concerns about their ability to engage with Apple in the app review process,\" and that it \"invests significant time and resources in engaging with developers directly\" to ensure the quality of apps on the platform.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple lays out in detail the process of how apps are reviewed for distribution on the store. It says the app review system is a \"human-led process\" and that all human reviewers ensure that apps \"are reliable, perform as expected, respect user privacy, and are free of objectionable content.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThroughout the years, Apple has sped up how long apps submitted to the platform are under review. According to Apple, 73% of prospective apps submitted by developers to the platform are now reviewed within 24 hours, and at the end, a final verdict is delivered to developers on whether the app is approved or rejected. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf an app is rejected, Apple says it provides the developer with information on the reason for the rejection, and says that the app makers have an opportunity to \"correspond with the Apple team member who reviewed the app.\" Furthermore, developers have a chance to appeal a rejection to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Review Board.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTargeting concerns that Apple exploits the app review process to maintain a dominant position in certain areas, or categories for apps, Apple says its goal is to protect consumers from \"fraudulent, non-functioning, malicious or scam apps.\" Central to the review process is the protection of consumers' privacy and security, according to Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>Developers also have the option to make a formal appeal to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Review Board. This is comprised of senior app reviewers with a high degree of experience in reviewing apps. The Board will review the app afresh and provide the developer with their response.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe main purpose of the App Review process is to protect consumers from fraudulent, non-functioning, malicious or scam apps. Central to the App Review process is the protection of our consumers' privacy and security. That is why the App Review process is iterative and some apps may require multiple rounds of submission before Apple is satisfied the app meets all of the Guidelines.</blockquote>The ACCC investigation will include submissions from Australian developers about their disapproval of the app review process or how they think they've been mistreated by the Cupertino-based tech giant. Apple rejects that sentiment, however, saying that Australian developers work directly with its Australian Developer Relations team to offer support and guidance on matters such as developing, designing, and maintaining apps.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/australia/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-review-guidelines/\">App Store Review Guidelines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-surprised-developer-concerns-app-review/\">Apple &#039;Surprised&#039; By Developer Frustration With Its App Review Process</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-surprised-by-developer-frustration-with-its-app-review-process.2289189/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dwDSrDYg3Ms:45b-pgLvnz0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dwDSrDYg3Ms:45b-pgLvnz0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dwDSrDYg3Ms\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0eca888e6cd68559079350e0522ec41a452a2a07a6dc6ceac952bd58fc94ce31","category":"Apple"}
