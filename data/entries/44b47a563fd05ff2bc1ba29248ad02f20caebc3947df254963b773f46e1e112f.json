Let’s be honest and admit that choosing a pair of cycling sunglasses is as much about fashion as it is about protection, and there’s nothing wrong with that.</p>\n<p>As with any cycling product though, there are far too many brands, styles and price points for any one person to trawl through. With that in mind, our expert testers have selected what they believe are the best cycling sunglasses on the market right now.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve finished exploring all of the options, keep reading to check out our buyer’s guide to cycling sunglasses.</p>\n<h2>Bollé Shifter</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bollé’s Shifter sunglasses blend modern and retro styling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bollé</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>RRP £149</li>\n<li>Comfortable and stylish</li>\n<li>Available with prescription lenses</li>\n</ul><p>Bollé’s stylish Shifter sunglasses have an angular look that somehow manages to be both thoroughly modern and also a little retro.</p>\n<p>The impact-resistant, single-piece lens offers great clarity. It’s also well vented and has an anti-fogging treatment applied, so they don’t steam up too easily in humid conditions.</p>\n<p>The reassuringly robust frame has a premium feel and the kinked arms grip your head very well. The thickness of the frame does mean it shows up in your peripheral vision, but it didn’t bother our tester.</p>\n<p>There’s also a prescription option available, for those who need it.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/sunglasses-and-goggles/sunglasses/bolle-shifter-sunglasses-review/\">Read our review of the Bollé Shifter

when they were initially released in 2015, but it’s hard to deny they reignited the trend for big sunglasses.</p>\n<p>The coverage of the 53mm tall, 131mm wide lens is excellent, with the chunky frame only visible at extreme angles.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the nose and ear pieces are both adjustable, so you’ll be certain to find a combination that offers a secure fit over the bumpiest of roads, and changing the lens is a simple process.</p>\n<p>Our only gripe is that we’d like to see Oakley’s excellent hydrophilic treatment on the inside of the lens.</p>\n<ul><li><a

Polar 3FX HDR lens for filtering out glare – these are sunglasses fit for every season.</p>\n<p>Switching between lenses is also a doddle, thanks to an innovative, spring-loaded design.</p>\n<p>Heavily vented frames, built using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, ensure consistent airflow and we didn’t experience any fogging during testing, despite the big

The nose-piece is adjustable, allowing you to tweak the fit to a degree too.</p>\n<p>Three lenses are included – a dark tint, yellow for low light and clear – making them great value. Swapping the lenses by popping them out of the frame is a formality and we had no qualms with the optics either.</p>\n<p>They are broad-framed, so the arms can interfere with some helmets, and we needed to do some fine-tuning with the nose-piece to get the fit just right and stop them touching our eyelashes. It’s hard to complain at this price though.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Ekoi PE9 Quickstep</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ekoi’s online store offers a large array of customisation options.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ekoi</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>RRP £86</li>\n<li>Good lens clarity</li>\n<li>On-trend styling</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ekoi.com/en/configurateur/perso-evo-9-3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy direct from Ekoi</a></li>\n</ul><p>Worn by <span>Julian</span> Alaphilippe and a host of other European pros, the Ekoi PE9 sunglasses were developed in collaboration with the riders of WorldTour team Deceuninck–QuickStep.</p>\n<p>The large, deeply wrapped lens gives an almost goggle-like feel, and consequently provides great protection from the elements.</p>\n<p>Lens clarity is also pleasingly good, but the standard tint is quite dark – they’re really a sunny day only option.</p>\n<p>A photochromic lens might be a better choice for cyclists in the UK, but fortunately, Ekoi’s online store offers a huge array of customisation options for both lenses and frame colours.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/sunglasses-and-goggles/sunglasses/ekoi-pe9-quickstep-sunglasses-review/\">Read our review of the Ekoi PE9 Quickstep sunglasses</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Endura FS260 Pro</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endura’s FS260 Pro sunglasses are a great value package, with three different lens options included in the box.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Endura </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>RRP £78</li>\n<li>Secure fit and good value</li>\n<li>Photochromic lens included</li>\n</ul><p>Endura’s FS260 Pro is more of a package than a single pair of sunglasses.

If you live somewhere where it’s often dark and wet, you’ll want to consider a sunglasses package that includes multiple lens options.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some brands offer photochromic lenses, which react to the light level to change their light transmission value, meaning they’ll automatically get darker when it’s sunny, then clearer when it’s not.</p>\n<h3>Frame</h3>\n<p>Frame choice is arguably more a matter of fashion because these dictate the overall shape and look of the sunglasses.</p>\n<p>Big, eighties-style sunglasses are back in fashion at the moment and these do have several advantages, such as massive amounts of protection and coverage, but their bold looks aren’t for everyone.</p>\n<p>Large frames, for example, can often hover in your peripheral vision, which some riders might find annoying, whereas frameless models offer a much more unrestricted view.</p>\n<h3>Arms</h3>\n<p>The arms of cycling sunglasses need to be robust enough to safely hold the sunglasses in place over even the roughest terrain. Often, tacky rubber inserts are added to increase friction without causing discomfort.</p>\n<p>High-quality models will also have reassuringly stiff arms and hinges without any play. If you’re spending a quite substantial sum of money on sunglasses, you want to know they’re built to last.</p>\n<h3>Nose bridge</h3>\n<p>Everyone has a different-shaped face and nose, so sunglasses with adjustable or interchangeable nose pieces can offer a more personalised fit.</p>\n<p>This can be especially important on sunglasses with large frames, where it’s key to ensure the frame doesn’t impinge on your view too much.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<p>When shopping for sunglasses, it’s worth considering the overall package.
