It all boils down to:</p>\n<ul><li>High-quality bearings (which are more expensive than you might imagine)</li>\n<li>Precision machining to make the most of those bearings (expensive from a machinery investment, quality control and labour cost point of view)</li>\n<li>Fancy lightweight materials (expensive if you’re not buying it in enormous bulk)</li>\n<li>And a nice finish (once again, expensive from a labour standpoint)</li>\n</ul><p>When you consider all of these brands are small-scale operations producing exceptionally high-quality niche products to appeal to fixie-loving weirdos like me, it’s hardly surprising they are pricey.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the scale, cheap OEM-spec (original equipment manufacturer) hubs typically use cheap, nasty bearings and, in my experience, are generally poorly made, meaning they eat through bearings frustratingly quickly.</p>\n<p>Given one of the key appeals of a fixed gear bike is low maintenance, this quickly becomes tiresome.</p>\n<p>Moving up in price a bit, something like <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=2698&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fmiche-primato-large-flange-pair-of-track-hubs%2Frp-prod164264\" target=\"_blank\">Miche’s Primato track hubs</a> (~£70 a pair) are perfectly nice, but these really are designed for track use only – they aren’t nearly as well sealed as something designed for out-of-doors use and you’re likely to trash them pretty quickly.</p>\n<h2>What makes Halo’s TK hubs so good?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hubs have been used on my much-abused Surly Steamroller.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Halo’s TK hubs deliver the quality of a boutique hub into a well-designed and unfussy package for a fraction of the price, starting at £115 for a pair at RRP.</p>\n<p>The hubs are available in 24-, 32-, 36- or 48-hole spoke drillings, double fixed or flip-flop threading, and come in silver, black or white finishes. The rear hub weighs a claimed 270g in its lightest configuration (that figure includes the track nuts).</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.halowheels.com/shop/components/hubs/rear-fix-g-track-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">interesting version of the hub that uses HG-splined cogs</a> rather than a traditional thread-on cog is also available. I’ve not tested one of these but if you make a habit of regularly swapping cogs, need an adjustable chain line or want to experiment with a funky <a href=\"http://www.whiteind.com/double-double\" target=\"_blank\">‘dinglespeed’</a> setup (a singlespeed setup that has multiple cogs or chainrings, allowing you to manually switch between ratios), it could be a good option.</p>\n<p>As the pedalling load is transferred onto the splines, the lockring on this hub also doesn’t have to handle any rotational forces. This is no bad thing if you make a habit of throwing down sweet back-pedal skids and find regular lockrings tend to seize in place for you.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> My hubs are laced to a pair of Halo Evaura rims.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>My particular hubs are laced to a set of Halo Evaura rims and have lived on my Surly Steamroller (the bike I must have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/riding-during-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\">banged on about the most</a> on BikeRadar) for the past 15 months or so.</p>\n<p>I have treated my poor ol’ Surly like trash, eating through numerous <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom brackets</a>, chains and brake blocks since I built it up last year.</p>\n<p>I’ve even managed to totally wear out a rear cog, which is an impressive feat when you consider reduced drivetrain wear is one of the things people love most about fixies.</p>\n<p>Despite rapid parts consumption elsewhere, the hubs are still spinning like new. I really am not exaggerating here – I genuinely can’t believe quite how nicely they still run.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hubs have spent <em>a lot</em> of their life looking like this.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There is absolutely no grittiness or play, which is seriously impressive given how many direct pressure wash blasts, deep stream crossings and muddy miles these have endured.</p>\n<p>I haven’t removed the seals from the bearings to check for water ingress for fear of irreversibly damaging them. However, there are no tell-tale rusty streaks around the bearings.</p>\n<p>The threaded end caps (Halo refers to these as end cones) don’t feature an o-ring to aid sealing, but these sit very snugly within the bearing bore, so I’m sure they help stop the worst grit from making its way to the bearings.</p>\n<p>The end caps also have a machined serrated face, which helps to stop the hubs slipping in the track ends under power.</p>\n<p>The hardy stainless steel track nuts are also really nice. They include a chunky captive washer that doesn’t spin as you tighten the nuts, which provides a more even and consistent clamping force. It also stops the finish on your track ends from getting damaged.</p>\n<p>Should the time ever come to disassemble the hubs, <a href=\"https://www.halowheels.com/how-do-i-swap-the-bearings-or-axle-on-the-halo-tk-track-rear-hub/\" target=\"_blank\">it looks to be a very simple process</a>, only requiring a handful of standard tools and standard-sized bearings.</p>\n<p>While my heart will always be set aflutter by boutique high-end hubs – and I would always encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/custom-bike-builders/\">support small brands</a> if you can afford to do so – my frugal head would have a hard time justifying buying anything other than these.</p>\n<p>Other fixed-gear fashionistas I know rate them equally highly and I have no doubt they’re going to provide years of fuss-free service.</p>\n<p>If you are considering building your own set of fixed gear wheels, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9fc3713e38c9c92ff010a28f50c720063e9684750e62cd1a3e4e499bc45d9df5","category":"Cycling"}
