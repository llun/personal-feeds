The downshift in process node isn't enough to account for the claimed performance uplift by itself, though—that comes from making the GPU itself significantly bigger and meaner.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762822#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762822&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3028dd755d280349f17351148cb87a97c40a5ba187fed403865d3109e786914c","category":"Tech"}
