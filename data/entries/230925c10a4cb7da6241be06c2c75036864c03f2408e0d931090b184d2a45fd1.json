The city agreed to provide $200 million in support to build infrastructure including roads and sewers, according to a notice from the city's council.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTSMC estimates that its total spending on the project, including capital expenditure, will be approximately $12 billion from 2021 to 2029, with the facility expected to directly create over 1,600 high-tech professional jobs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nConstruction of the Arizona plant is now said to be \"well under way.\" The facility will mass-produce chips fabricated with a five-nanometer process by 2024. TSMC has been gradually miniaturizing its process over the years, going from a 16nm A10 chip in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 7 models, to a 7nm A13 chip in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> models, and a 5nm process for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>'s A14 chip. Likely clients for the chips from the Arizona factory include Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTSMC already operates a factory in Camas, Washington and design centers in Austin, Texas and San Jose, California, so the Arizona facility will be its second manufacturing site in the United States. The company's main factories are located in Taiwan. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Arizona plant will increase the opportunity for Apple's custom silicon chips, such as the A14 or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, to be feasibly manufactured within the United States.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arizona/\">Arizona</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-supplier-arizona-plant-well-under-way/\">Construction of Apple Supplier Plant in Arizona 'Well Under Way,' Will Manufacture Chips by 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/construction-of-apple-supplier-plant-in-arizona-well-under-way-will-manufacture-chips-by-2024.2298895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gZjR-E-j_GY:Y1qOitC1AaA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gZjR-E-j_GY:Y1qOitC1AaA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gZjR-E-j_GY\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"230925c10a4cb7da6241be06c2c75036864c03f2408e0d931090b184d2a45fd1","category":"Apple"}
