It used to be that quantum effects were confined to physics laboratories and delicate experiments. But modern technology increasingly relies on quantum mechanics for its basic operation, and the importance of quantum effects will only grow in the decades to come. As such, physicist Miguel F. Morales has taken on the herculean task of explaining quantum mechanics to laypeople in this seven-part series (no math, we promise). Below is the fifth story in the series, but you can always find <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/the-curious-observers-guide-to-quantum-mechanics/\">the starting story</a> plus a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/exploring-the-quantum-world/\">landing page for the entire series thus far</a> on site.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Sung to the abbess’s lines in \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VRyQprlu8\">Maria</a>\" from <em>The Sound of Music</em>:</p>\n<p>\"How do you catch a wave like Maria?
