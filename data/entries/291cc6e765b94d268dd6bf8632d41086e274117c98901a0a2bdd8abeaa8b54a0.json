This large orbital rocket will be about the same size as SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. However, Ellis said, the entire vehicle will be reusableâ€”the first and second stages, as well as the payload fairing. And it will have the capacity to lift 20 tons to low Earth orbit in reusable mode, about 20 percent more than a Falcon 9 booster that lands on a drone ship.</p>\n<p>With the Terran-R vehicle, therefore, Ellis said Relativity Space aspires to not just match the remarkably capable Falcon 9 rocket but to exceed its performance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770521#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770521&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"291cc6e765b94d268dd6bf8632d41086e274117c98901a0a2bdd8abeaa8b54a0","category":"Tech"}
