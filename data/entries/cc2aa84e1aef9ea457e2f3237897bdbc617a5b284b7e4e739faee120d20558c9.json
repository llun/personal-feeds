Not least because back in 2013 some people thought it was a good idea to create a cycling magazine that required trips abroad.</p>\n<p>Cycling insurer <a href=\"https://www.pedalsure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pedalsure</a> has taken the roadmap one step further and, inspired by <a href=\"https://onewayroadtobeer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">onewayroadtobeer.com</a> (which we can also get behind) has created 'the official lockdown countdown for cyclists: <a href=\"https://whencanwerideagain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">whencanwerideagain.com</a>.</p>\n<p>It tracks how long remains until we're legally permitted – provided the government doesn't push it back – to go on a group ride, have a cafe stop outdoors and indoors, travel abroad and create our own peloton.</p>\n<p>It'll be news to the groups gathering in and near London's Richmond and Bushy Parks at the weekend that we shouldn't be riding with more than one other person from a different household, but I'm sure most people have stuck to the <a href=\"/in-depth/8035/what-is-an-acceptable-distance-and-duration-to-ride-during-the-covid-19-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">words of our own dear leader</a> and kept rides short, local and solo.</p>\n<p>From 29th March group rides of up to six people or two households will be allowed. This is also when organised outdoor sports are supposed to return, including <a href=\"/news/9267/time-trials-set-to-restart-in-england-on-29th-march\" target=\"_blank\">time-trials</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 111: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nCafe stops for six people, or two households, get the green light from 12th April outdoors and 17th May indoors. </p>\n<p>International travel is technically allowed from 17th May too, however the destination will likely depend on the rules of that country and whether you've been vaccinated. Luckily we know <a href=\"/tags/big-ride\">a few good rides</a> in Cyprus and Portugal.</p>\n<p>It all leads up to 21st June, when we'll have five days of completely free riding before we hunker down in front of the TV again to watch the <a href=\"/tags/tour-de-france\">2021 Tour de France</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"cc2aa84e1aef9ea457e2f3237897bdbc617a5b284b7e4e739faee120d20558c9","category":"Cycling"}
