Based on the current posts, Apple plans to publish different interviews with artists about their upcoming or newly released albums and songs and provide insight into the music industry.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of now, the integration between ‌Apple News‌ and ‌Apple Music‌ is rather limited, in the sense that finding content requires a user to search, and find the ‌Apple Music‌ channel within ‌Apple News‌ manually. In the future, Apple may more tightly integrate the two services to make it easier for subscribers, and non-subscribers to access ‌Apple Music‌ editorial content.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/\">Apple News</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/apple-music-news-editorial-content/\">Apple News Gaining Apple Music Editorial Content</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-news-gaining-apple-music-editorial-content.2292603/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S2gwGfgtN30:X2vdcG7CJwk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S2gwGfgtN30:X2vdcG7CJwk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/S2gwGfgtN30\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e6c7db60fa18875d93e9884b2366cf58478b0c0a654c803b987fd67bbee9c2ae","category":"Apple"}
