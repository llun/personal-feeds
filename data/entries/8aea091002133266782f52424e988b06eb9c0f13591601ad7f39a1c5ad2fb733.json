If you always ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to select Spotify, for example, Spotify will be the default, but you can also change it in the future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTo be clear, when asking &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to play a song in Spotify in iOS 14.5, it is not setting it as the \"default,\" with Apple clarifying because the company does not want users to be confused if &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; asks again for your preferences in the future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/siri-choose-audio-apps.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1484\" height=\"835\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786917\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will learn your preferences for all types of audio content rather than just music. It will let you open podcasts in Apple Podcasts or a third-party podcasts app, and let you choose a specific audiobook app if you listen to audiobooks.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; offers up a list of audio apps that you have installed whenever you make a content request, and that choice will dictate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s behavior going forward, but &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; may ask again in the future and even when a preferred audio option has been selected, it can be changed by asking for a different app. If you've selected Spotify, for example, but want to swap to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, you can say \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, play [song] in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has been improving the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; audio request feature throughout the beta, and the third beta refines the dialogs for app selection. App developers are able to choose participate in the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; app selection feature by making their apps available as an option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; app selection feature will be available to everyone when iOS 14.5 launches this spring.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/apple-siri-music-setting-ios-14-5/\">Apple Clarifies How Siri Music Service Settings Work in iOS 14.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-clarifies-how-siri-music-service-settings-work-in-ios-14-5.2287057/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3OqQoIw2guY:BBAXnUPVM84:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3OqQoIw2guY:BBAXnUPVM84:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3OqQoIw2guY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8aea091002133266782f52424e988b06eb9c0f13591601ad7f39a1c5ad2fb733","category":"Apple"}
