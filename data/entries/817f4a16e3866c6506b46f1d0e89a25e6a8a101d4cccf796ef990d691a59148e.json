Users will have the ability to decline the installation of certain apps.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new legislation is an amendment to the existing \"On Consumer Protection\" law that will require the pre-installation of software on all devices sold in Russia, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and smart TVs. The pre-installed software will include antivirus and cartographic apps, social media apps, and \"Public Service\" apps for payments and civil services.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple told <em>Vedomosti</em> that beginning on April 1, \"users will be offered a choice of applications from Russian developers, which they will be able to choose for further installation on their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\" Furthermore, Apple is reportedly discussing adding a new section to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> in Russia specifically dedicated to promoting Russian apps. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Ministry of Digital Affairs assures that it is not seeking to create a dominant position for itself on the list of pre-installed apps. In fact, the Ministry says that if there are other apps on the market, they should be added to the list for users to pre-install.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>The Ministry is not interested in the fact that popular programs included in the list for mandatory pre-installation occupy a dominant position. If there are alternative offers of interest to users and rapidly gaining popularity on the market, they will be included in this collection and will also be offered for pre-installation.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2019, Apple warned that this new law would open up its device to possible risks and that it would be the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/03/russian-law-requires-smartphones-apps-preinstalled/\">equivalent to jailbreaking</a>.\" Apple maintains tight control over the pre-installation of apps on its devices and strict moderation over apps allowed onto the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, so the expected change is unusual. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/russia/\">Russia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/apple-to-offer-government-approved-apps-russia/\">Apple Agrees to Offer Government-Approved Pre-Installed Apps for Devices in Russia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-agrees-to-offer-government-approved-pre-installed-apps-for-devices-in-russia.2288493/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0R4L_BAWKHI:PixGbH8r8PE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0R4L_BAWKHI:PixGbH8r8PE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0R4L_BAWKHI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"817f4a16e3866c6506b46f1d0e89a25e6a8a101d4cccf796ef990d691a59148e","category":"Apple"}
