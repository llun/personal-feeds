Nomad is celebrating International Surfing Day by highlighting <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fthe-nomadic%2Fapple-watch-surf\">just how useful the Apple Watch is</a> when surfing. In fact, Nomad believes that the Apple Watch is the ultimate surf watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch is highly water resistant, and it's more than durable enough to <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fthe-nomadic%2Fapple-watch-surf\">stand up to sand and sea water</a>. It can be worn in the water while surfing, especially when you have the right band, but make sure to rinse your Apple Watch with fresh water after it's been exposed to salt water.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/nomad-apple-watch-surfing.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNomad had <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fthe-nomadic%2Fmatt-bromley-interview\">big wave surfer Matt Bromley</a> wear the Apple Watch and a Nomad Rugged Strap while surfing huge waves at Jaws Surf Break in Maui and Mavericks in California. He found that the watch was resilient to wipeouts, even when he was pushed into deep water.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple offers a native surfing Workout option on Apple Watch, but there are also useful third-party surfing apps like Dawn Patrol. Dawn Patrol is able to track number of waves caught, wave speed, distance paddled, time spent riding waves, and surfing session length.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/nomad-surf-app.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDawn Patrol also provides custom watch faces that can tell surfers swell height, direction, period, tide, water temperature, and more, plus with the watch's GPS, location is synced so swell forecasts update for the closest breaks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch is, of course, tracking activity data like movement and heart rate, plus it also has other uses for surfers. An LTE Apple Watch lets surfers communicate while out on the water, plus in an emergency, it can be used to contact emergency services with the built-in SOS feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/nomad-apple-watch-surfing-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNomad has a series of Apple Watch bands that are perfect for activities like surfing, including the black rubber <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-strap-v2-black-hardware\">$60 Rugged Strap</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Factive-strap-pro-heinen-leather-classic-brown-silver-hardware\">$80 Active Strap Pro</a> with waterproof leather, and the sleeker <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-14527713?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fsport-strap-black\">$60 Sport Strap</a>, all of which are great for water sports and sweaty workouts thanks to their waterproofing.
