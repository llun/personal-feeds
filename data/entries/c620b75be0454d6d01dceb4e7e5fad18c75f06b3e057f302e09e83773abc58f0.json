With all the advancements in design, Bob was ready to unload the frame and some parts for 100 dollars in 1987.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207764\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1912-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></p>\n<p>I had been riding one-speed cobbled bikes because of cost and simplicity’s sake. We all wanted multi-geared bikes at this point and it seemed that single speed was no longer a thing. I built the bike as you see it in the winter of 1987. Coming from a long history of riding, I started on a resto-mod restore.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207763\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1913.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>I scoured all the bike shops in the Sacramento valley and the foothills for new old stock.

The braze-on Canti mounts were brazed by Craig Smith. Craig was noted to be the first guy from Sacramento to compete in the Repack Downhill.<br />\n-The fork: Not a cook bros. fork. This fork has baffled many experts. It’s not a champion or BMX fork. There was a report of DKG making a batch of forks to be sold through Koski in 1979/80. This would be pre-trail master.<br />\n-The wheels: I had these custom-built by Steve Sanchez, owner of Adventure Mountain bikes.<br />\n-Hubs: Suntour Superb 9000, 32 hole<br />\n-Rims: Bontrager “cut down” Mavic MA-2, provided by Bob Ward and the REI clearance bin. Nobody knew what to do with 32 hole rims! Too early.<br />\n-Quick release Campy steel with serrated washers on rear wheel.<br />\n-Brakes: Mafac with Tommaselli levers and tandem cables<br />\n-Cranks CQP 181mm, DID chain 32&#215;16<br />\n-Seat post: homemade GT cromo epoxyed to an Elite top with WTB saddle<br />\n-Other frame details: Campy cable clamps, TA alloy bottle cage. Bottle mounts, brake bridge by Steve Rex.</p>\n<p>I raced this bike in NorCal SS events for many years and still consider this bike a daily driver.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this bike,  as it’s given me so much pleasure.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"c620b75be0454d6d01dceb4e7e5fad18c75f06b3e057f302e09e83773abc58f0","category":"Cycling"}
