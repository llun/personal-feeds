{"title":"Google Touts Chrome 89 Memory Savings That 'Keep Your Mac Cooler' While Browsing","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/google-touts-chrome-89-memory-savings-mac/","date":1615544925000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/05/Google_Chrome_Material_Icon-450x450-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-450592\" />Google's Chrome browser has been criticized for years for being a system resource hog, but Chromium developers are making some loud claims about how much smarter the latest version is at using and freeing up memory on macOS.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/advanced-memory-management-and-more.html?m=1\">new post</a> on Google's Chromium blog, Chrome developers recently managed to shrink the memory footprint of background tabs on Mac  by up to 8%, or just over 1GB on some systems in version 89 of the browser. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTab Throttling, which acts on pages that are not currently active, is also said to have led to significant improvements by reducing JavaScript Timer wake-ups. Background tabs no longer wake up the CPU as often and preserve battery life, and as a result, Chrome uses up to 5x less CPU, while battery life is up to 1.25 hours better, says Google.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the developers, since its introduction in Chrome 87 and wider rollout in Chrome 88, the feature has been responsible for a 65% improvement on Chrome's Apple Energy Impact score for pages in the background. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe highlighted improvements are in stark contrast to recently reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/20/chrome-safari-ram-test/\">independent measurements</a> which claimed to demonstrate that Google Chrome uses 10x more RAM than Safari on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe interpretation of those measurements has since been <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26179817\">contested</a>, but separately Apple still claims that Safari on ‌&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj;‌ is \"50% faster on average at loading frequently visited websites than Chrome.\" Apple also says Safari can stream video for up to one and a half hours longer, and can keep users browsing normally on a single charge for up to one hour longer, compared to Chrome and Firefox.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle Chrome for Mac is a free download available directly from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Google's servers</a>. <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/utilities/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> for iOS is a free download for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
