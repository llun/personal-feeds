Even if you want to venture onto rougher surfaces or want a bike that can handle off-road riding, the latest crop of gravel and adventure bikes will help you transition between on and off-road adventures smoothly.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure what kind of road bike to go for, this buyer’s guide will help you choose the best bike for you based on what kind of riding you’ll be doing on it and what your budget is.</p>\n<p>Want more information? Read our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/womens-road-bike-buyers-guide-comprehensive-advice-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">comprehensive women’s road bike buyer’s guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>What makes a road bike?</h3>\n<p>Road bikes, as the name suggests, are first and foremost designed to be really efficient at riding on hard surfaces such as tarmac and concrete — leaving adventure bikes aside for one moment.</p>\n<p>They tend to have a handlebar that curves around and down, known as a ‘drop handlebar’, which allows the rider to place their hands in a range of positions for comfort and efficiency.</p>\n<p>They will have a stiff frame and, bar a few examples, no suspension built in, unlike mountain bikes.</p>\n<h3>Long-distance, speed or adventure?</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve decided that a road bike is what you’re after, the next question is what kind of road bike you need.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/road/the-best-endurance-road-bikes-under-2000/\">Endurance road bikes</a> are designed to be comfortable over long distances. Some are focused on long-distance race events, such as multi-day stage races, others are more specifically for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-touring-bike-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">touring</a>.</p>\n<p>They tend to place the rider in a relatively upright position, have gearing that makes spinning up long climbs a little easier, and will often have lugs for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> to be fitted.</p>\n<p>Race bikes are designed for out-and-out speed. They will have a stiff frame for optimum power transfer from pedal-stroke to drivetrain, gearing that facilitates high-speed sprints and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">frame geometry</a> that places the rider in an aggressive position to enable them to push out plenty of power.</p>\n<p>Adventure or gravel bikes have become increasingly popular, and are essentially road bikes that have been designed to be ridden off-road.</p>\n<p>They’re built sturdier to handle rough ground, take chunky tyres to provide better grip in wet and muddy conditions, and will have a frame that’s designed to be comfortable and cushion the rider from the worst of off-road knocks and bumps – some even include suspension.</p>\n<p>Popular for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a> and multi-day adventures, they’ll usually have plenty of lugs to allow luggage to be fitted to the bike, like panniers and frame bags.</p>\n<h3>What road and adventure bike to get for your budget</h3>\n<p>Once you know what type of bike you’re looking for, the next question is what can you get for your money.</p>\n<p>You can find good road bikes from about £600 / €660 / $780. These will tend to have aluminium frames and a good entry-level 2x groupset, such as Shimano Sora.</p>\n<p>At about £1,100 / €1,220 / $1,445 bikes will start to have hydraulic <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes</a>, which provide really good wet-weather braking power.</p>\n<p>At £2,000 / €2,200 / $2,600 you’ll start to see bikes with good quality carbon frames and higher-level gear groupsets, such as Shimano Ultegra. Electronic gearing starts to make an appearance at £2,500 / €2,800 / $3,300.</p>\n<p>If you want to grab a bargain, it’s worth considering buying a bike from a previous model year or looking for a second-hand bike. If you decide a used bike is the way to go, don’t forget to read our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/workshop-what-to-watch-for-when-buying-a-used-carbon-frame/\">guide to buying a second-hand bike</a> to make sure you get a bargain rather than a dud.</p>\n<h3>Do I need a women’s-specific bike?</h3>\n<p>The short answer is no, but many women find them more comfortable, so they are definitely worth considering.</p>\n<p>For some women’s-specific bikes, the only difference is a saddle that’s designed for women. This can have a huge effect on comfort, but it’s also something you can change yourself later if you don’t get on with the saddle on your new bike.</p>\n<p>Other women’s bikes are designed entirely for women with a completely different frame design. Both Liv and Canyon take this approach.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to know more, check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/5-approaches-to-womens-specific-bike-design/\" target=\"_blank\">approaches to women’s-specific bike design</a>.</p>","author":"Aoife Glass","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"d28a1735ba901d85685a73f8aee934dca12e87d65a5d089b9b1978dc2b489b6b","category":"Cycling"}
