Apple plans to force app developers to ask users before accessing the advertising identifier (IDFA) on user devices for ad tracking purposes, with the requirement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-app-store-review-guidelines-tracking/\">to be enforced</a> when iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/28/app-tracking-transparency-required-soon/\">are released</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has clarified that the opt-out options <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/apple-responds-to-facebook-tracking-criticism/\">apply to all developers</a> who track users, including Apple, but Apple will not need to use the pop ups asking for permission because its advertising platform does not track users.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nVestager told <em>Reuters</em> that thus far, she has not received complaints about Apple's changes, and that she thinks it's a good move for privacy. \"It is a very good thing to have a clear opt-out option. If you look at the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, these are some of the solutions we are looking at there,\" she said.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/eu-antitrust-vp-apple-equal-app-treatment/\">EU Antitrust VP Warns Apple to Give Equal Treatment to All Apps Amid Tracking Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-antitrust-vp-warns-apple-to-give-equal-treatment-to-all-apps-amid-tracking-changes.2283860/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1E_XZhG_hac:j66iOHFR4JI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1E_XZhG_hac:j66iOHFR4JI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1E_XZhG_hac\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"466f9c59e0bc84ed3769047a6b855a1647aabe5655aa36bba4e29cad6c88b26d","category":"Apple"}
