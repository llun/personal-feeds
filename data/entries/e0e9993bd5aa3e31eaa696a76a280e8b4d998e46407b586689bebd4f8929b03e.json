She takes up the story...</p>\n<p>‘I had always been into sport, having done competitive swimming, marathons and triathlons,’ Fiona tells us. ‘I first got a taste for ultra-cycling when I rode 1,800km from Heidelberg to Stockholm in 12 days.</p>\n<p>‘My friends thought I was crazy, but then they suggested I do London-Edinburgh-London in 2017. On arriving in London, I realised I was badly under-prepared, as I had only ridden 2,000km in total that year, with my longest ride being 200km.</p>\n<p>‘Luckily, I was riding with a couple of experienced guys who saw that I was a rookie and were encouraging. When we arrived at the first checkpoint, I asked them if they were planning to sleep for the night. To my surprise, they replied, “Yes, for 90 minutes!”</p>\n<p>‘Somehow I managed to get through that ride and they were so impressed that they suggested I do the Transcontinental.</p>\n<p>‘So, after completing medical school in May 2019 I began my training for the Transcontinental. Saxony, the surrounding area to my home in Dresden, is the mecca for ultra-distance cycling in Germany, so I did my preparation there, including a crazy 800km audax following the River Elbe that includes hill climb race sections.</p>\n<p>‘On the start line of the Transcontinental I knew I would be able to finish within the time limit, but I never thought I could actually win it.</p>\n<p>‘What helped me was that I rode steadily, and I limited my stopping time. Some people had a higher average riding speed than me, but they had longer stops.</p>\n<p>‘I am very efficient and structured in the way I do things. When I ride I am good at estimating my body’s capacity to do things, plus medical school teaches you to get by on very little sleep!</p>\n<p>‘When I crossed the finish line in Brest I was ecstatic, but in truth I was a little sad that the adventure was over. I am back working as a surgical oncologist in Dresden, and hope to do the postponed Transcontinental again this year.</p>\n<p>‘Many parents give their daughters the idea that sports are for boys and that getting sweaty doesn’t look good. I also feel that women have to achieve so much more than men to get the same recognition.</p>\n<p>‘Thankfully my parents always encouraged me and my siblings to do sport and not to see any limits to what we could achieve when we were young.</p>\n<p>‘I want to show that ultra-cycling is something that can be done by anyone regardless of their gender, race, or socio-cultural background. I hope that I have achieved that, although I also know there is still room for improvement.'</p>\n<p>For more from Zwift this International Women's Month, <a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/\" target=\"_blank\">visit here</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/cyclists\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Cyclists</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"e0e9993bd5aa3e31eaa696a76a280e8b4d998e46407b586689bebd4f8929b03e","category":"Cycling"}
