{"title":"Apple 'homeOS' Mentioned in Job Listing Ahead of WWDC","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/","date":1622633993000,"content":"An <a href=\"https://jobs.apple.com/en-gb/details/200209660/senior-ios-engineer-apple-music\">Apple job listing</a> has mentioned \"homeOS,\" an otherwise never-before heard of Apple operating system, ahead of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a> next week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/homeOS2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSpotted by developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jlacort/status/1400007637090111494?s=20\">Javier Lacort</a>, the Apple job listing for a Senior iOS Engineer in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> explicitly mentions \"homeOS\" on two occasions, alongside Apple's other operating systems including iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.<blockquote>You'll get to work with system engineers across Apple, learning the inner-workings of iOS, watchOS, tvOS and <strong>homeOS</strong>, and optimizing your code for performance in ways only Apple can. Come join our team and make a real difference for music lovers worldwide.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Music‌ Frameworks team owns the technology stack that enables the system-integrated ‌Apple Music‌ experience on all of our mobile platforms: iOS, watchOS, and <strong>homeOS</strong>.</blockquote>Interestingly, the job listing mentions homeOS as a \"mobile platform,\" seemingly highlighting it as more akin to iOS and watchOS than systems like macOS and tvOS, but it is not clear why that would be the case. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe operating system could simply be a rebranding of Apple's current smart home software, in much the same way iOS for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> was rebranded iPadOS and OS X was changed to macOS, or potentially an entirely new OS.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\">Mark Gurman commented</a> that Apple still lacks a \"unifying strategy\" for the smart home market. It is possible that homeOS could be software designed to spearhead a more centralized smart home strategy, perhaps unifying the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>'s audioOS and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>'s tvOS. Apple is rumored to be developing a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/\">combined Apple TV and HomePod device</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/\">HomePod with a screen</a>. For now, what homeOS will precisely entail remains purely speculative.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's homeOS could feasibly debut as soon as next week at WWDC, where the company is expected to unveil major updates to its various operating systems. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home/\">Home</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing/\">Apple 'homeOS' Mentioned in Job Listing Ahead of WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-homeos-mentioned-in-job-listing-ahead-of-wwdc.2298898/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZLNpTrZ63LQ:EzBG9wuX6Xo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZLNpTrZ63LQ:EzBG9wuX6Xo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZLNpTrZ63LQ\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d5609291d4581524c5b9f61308de06cdd95f9177309c69dfc1c058d0f675023","category":"Apple"}
