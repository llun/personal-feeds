Along with Phil Harrison, Justice was the face of the project, frequently giving interviews and talking to the press. Justice hasn't updated his <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrjustice/\">LinkedIn</a> profile yet, but following a report from <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-booming-google-search-chief-gives-more-love-to-product-managers\">The Information</a>, Google told <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/05/03/stadia-john-justice/\">9to5Google</a>, \"We can confirm John is no longer with Google, and we wish him well on his next step.\"</p>\n<p>This latest departure is just another sign that Google's game-streaming service is circling the drain. A Bloomberg report from February revealed that the service missed Google's internal sales estimates by \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/report-stadia-undershot-to-the-tune-of-hundreds-of-thousands-of-users/\">hundreds of thousands</a>\" of users. Shortly before the release of that report, Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/google-closes-stadias-dedicated-game-studios-after-less-than-2-years/\">shut down</a> its in-house game studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment, after less than two years of operation, citing the high cost of operating it. This move led to Stadia's other high-profile departure, the exit of Assassin's Creed co-creator Jade Raymond.</p>\n<p>Justice's last big media hit was a video interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnMDA_FBugU\">The Escapist</a> in December. This interview from just six months ago shows how quickly Stadia collapsed at Google, with Justice<a href=\"https://youtu.be/MnMDA_FBugU?t=300\"> talking up</a> in-house projects led by Raymond and saying that \"over time, we're going to keep doing more and more in-house games.\" Two months later, all those plans would be canceled.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762224#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762224&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e74a6820285c0f5fbd2860f3f96fc876eeb741365ddddbdbd54cf6bba9d674a","category":"Tech"}
