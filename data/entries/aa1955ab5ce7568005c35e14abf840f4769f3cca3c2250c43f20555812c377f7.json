On the right side of the machine, there's a visible HDMI port, accompanied by a USB-C/Thunderbolt port and followed by an SD Card reader. The left side features two additional USB-C/Thunderbolt ports and a ‌MagSafe‌ charging slot, for a total of three USB-C/Thunderbolt ports instead of four as we have today.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors from Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <em>Bloomberg</em> have previously said that all of these ports will be coming to the 2021 MacBook Pro models, but the schematics both confirm the addition of the new ports and give us insight into their positioning.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe codename for the Mac is \"J316,\" which suggests that the logic board that we've seen is for the 16-inch MacBook Pro. There's also a \"J314\" model that likely correlates to the 14-inch MacBook Pro that Apple is also rumored to be working on. Both machines are expected to feature the new ports, ‌MagSafe‌ charging option, and upgraded Apple silicon chips.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis information, which was also shared by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/21/apple-ransomware-leak-new-macbook-pro/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, comes from a ransomware group called REvil, which claims to have accessed the internal computers of Apple supplier Quanta Computer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with the logic board layout, the documentation includes deeply technical listings of MacBook components and layouts that may ultimately provide additional information on these machines as it's parsed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nREvil has threatened to release additional documents stolen from Quanta Computer if Apple does not pay a ransom fee by May 1. REvil plans to release new files every day until Apple pays the fee, and Apple has not commented on the situation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nQuanta Computer said that it has indeed been subject to \"cyber attacks on a small number of Quanta servers\" but that there's \"no material impact on the company's business operation.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/macbook-pro-stolen-schematics-ports/\">Stolen MacBook Pro Schematics Confirm Apple's Plans to Add More Ports</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/stolen-macbook-pro-schematics-confirm-apples-plans-to-add-more-ports.2292640/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QrvgT0eu4MY:GuLzaLjvmj4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QrvgT0eu4MY:GuLzaLjvmj4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QrvgT0eu4MY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa1955ab5ce7568005c35e14abf840f4769f3cca3c2250c43f20555812c377f7","category":"Apple"}
