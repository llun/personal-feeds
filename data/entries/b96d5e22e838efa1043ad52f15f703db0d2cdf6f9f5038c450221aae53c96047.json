In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a>, you could have a set spot for your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>, but with iPadOS 15, you can put them anywhere, just like you can on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApp Library is another new feature that was introduced on the ‌iPhone‌ first, and it's a useful change that lets you see and manage all of the apps you have installed on your ‌iPad‌ in one spot.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMultitasking is an ‌iPad‌ exclusive, and it's been improved in iPadOS 15. We already did a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/ipados-15-multitasking/\">whole dedicated video on it</a>, but we couldn't ignore the user interface updates in our list of top iPadOS features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlso new to the ‌iPad‌ is a \"Quick Note\" option for the Notes app. With a swipe of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, you can open up a Quick Note no matter which app you're in to jot down notes. You can also create a Quick Note from Control Center or with a keyboard shortcut.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple introduced Safari updates across <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, iPadOS 15, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> so this isn't an iPad-only feature, but Safari has a streamlined tab bar and support for Tab Groups so you can better organize your tabs. Web extensions are supported in iPadOS, there's a new customizable start page, and you can refresh a webpage by pulling down from the top.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSafari also now prevents trackers from accessing your IP address, and if you have a paid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> account, a Private Relay feature will encrypt all of your browsing activity.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are your favorite iPadOS 15 features?
