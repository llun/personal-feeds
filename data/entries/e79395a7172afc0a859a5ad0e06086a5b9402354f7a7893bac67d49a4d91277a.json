It is water resistant so it can be worn in the pool or in the ocean, and it lasts for five days without needing to be charged.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/fitbit-luxe.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22386394/fitbit-luxe-fitness-wellness-tracker-price-release-date-features\">The Verge</a></em> points out, the Luxe has more of a fashion orientation than Fitbit's prior devices, which is a tactic that Apple tried with the initial Apple Watch launch before changing its advertising to more of a health and fitness focus. \"Fitness &amp; wellness goes fashion-forward,\" reads Fitbit's Luxe marketing materials.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFitbit has made a range of accessories available for the Luxe, including various link and mesh bracelet options, along with double wrap and woven bands.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe $150 price point includes six months of Fitbit's Premium service, which normally costs $9.99 per month. Fitbit Premium includes advanced tracking insights, sleep tools, workout options, and mindfulness sessions with Deepak Chopra.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fitbit Luxe can be <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/trackers/luxe\">pre-ordered as of today</a>, and Fitbit says it will ship out in late May.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fitbit/\">Fitbit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/fitbit-luxe-fitness-tracker/\">Fitbit Debuts New $150 Fashion-Focused 'Luxe' Fitness Tracker</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fitbit-debuts-new-150-fashion-focused-luxe-fitness-tracker.2292224/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OXacH4KJJQw:3BCmQiHAea4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OXacH4KJJQw:3BCmQiHAea4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OXacH4KJJQw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e79395a7172afc0a859a5ad0e06086a5b9402354f7a7893bac67d49a4d91277a","category":"Apple"}
