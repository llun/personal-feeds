The city was totally unprepared, I saw snow plows getting stuck in snow and all public transportation was off for multiple days. Since I needed to send out some letters and therefore had to go outside anyway, I decided to take my track bike and camera and try to get some nice videos of the snow-cycling-chaos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thanks, Jacob!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ae320f8777534181e340a0a404d33b564ccd050bbf3b8b28c5bada866c428d70","category":"Cycling"}
