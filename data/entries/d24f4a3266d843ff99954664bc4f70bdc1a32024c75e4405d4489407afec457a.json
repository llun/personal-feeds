Less than one percent of respondents thought that iMessage's \"Shared with You\" feature, Health app upgrades including fall-risk metrics and data sharing, and improvements to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/maps/\">Apple Maps</a> with more transit details and AR walking directions were the best new features. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> app improvements with Spatial Audio, screen sharing, grid view, and portrait mode, the redesigned notifications system, and Focus statuses only attracted around five percent of respondents.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen asked what features respondents thought should have been added in ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌, 32.3 percent said that there should have been interactive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>, 21 percent said that there should have been always-on display features, 14.9 percent said that there should have been Pro apps such as Xcode or Final Cut Pro for the ‌iPad‌, and 13.2 percent said that there should have been better external display support for the ‌iPad‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/iphone-13-teal-with-text.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ updates, the survey also investigated triskaidekaphobia, a superstitious fear of the number 13, around the naming of the upcoming ‌iPhone 13‌. As many as one in five ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users said that they would be actively put off by the \"‌iPhone 13‌\" moniker.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRespondents were also asked how they thought Apple should name its upcoming series of ‌iPhone‌ models. Interestingly, most responses indicated that the devices should not be called the \"‌iPhone 13‌.\" 38 percent said that Apple should call its next smartphone series simply \"‌iPhone‌ (2021),\" 26 percent thought that the \"‌iPhone 13‌\" was the best name, and only 13 percent said that they would like to see the devices called the \"‌iPhone‌ 12S.\"<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/21/users-underwhelmed-by-ios-15-and-ipados-15-survey-suggests/\">Users Underwhelmed by iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, Survey Suggests</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/users-underwhelmed-by-ios-15-and-ipados-15-survey-suggests.2301737/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1Nr2QDuDHyk:rXs4L3Hmqlg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1Nr2QDuDHyk:rXs4L3Hmqlg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1Nr2QDuDHyk\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d24f4a3266d843ff99954664bc4f70bdc1a32024c75e4405d4489407afec457a","category":"Apple"}
