The data is based on a sampling of 2.5 million daily mobile active users. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen looking at users worldwide who allow app tracking, the figure rises to 12% of users in a 5.3 million user sample size.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/att-opt-out-flurry-analytics1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the release of iOS 14.5, apps must now ask for and receive user permission before they can can access a device's random advertising identifier, which is used to track user activity across apps and websites. Users can either enable or disable the ability for apps to ask to track them. Apple disables the setting by default.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince the update almost two weeks ago, Flurry's figures show a stable rate of app-tracking opt-outs, with the U.S. figure hovering between 11-13%, and 2-5% worldwide. The challenge for personalized ads market will be significant if the first two weeks end up reflecting a long-term trend.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/att-opt-out-flurry-analytics2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/\">vociferous opponent</a> of ATT, has already started attempting to convince users that they must enable tracking in iOS 14.5 if they want to help keep Facebook and Instagram \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/02/facebook-instagram-att-prompt-free-of-charge/\">free of charge.</a>\" That sentiment would seem to go against the social network's earlier claim that ATT will have a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/facebook-att-impact-manageable/\">manageable</a>\" impact on its business and could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/zuckerberg-anti-tracking-benefit-facebook/\">even benefit Facebook</a> in the long term.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFlurry Analytics, owned by Verizon Media, is used in over 1 million mobile applications, providing aggregated insights across 2 billion mobile devices per month.
