{"title":"Next-Generation 16-Inch MacBook Pro Seemingly Filed in Regulatory Database Ahead of WWDC","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/16-inch-macbook-pro-regulatory-filing/","date":1622734240000,"content":"Apple is widely rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">planning new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a>, each with a mini-LED display and an improved iteration of the M1 chip. The notebooks are expected to feature a new design with a flatter top and bottom and more ports, including the return of an HDMI port, SD card slot, and a magnetic power cable. Rumors also suggest the Touch Bar will be retired in favor of physical Fn keys.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-render.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLending further credence to these plans, MacRumors has potentially discovered the next-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro in a Chinese regulatory database. The listing, filed on April 14 by Apple supplier Sunwoda Electronic, is for a battery with an Apple-like model identifier A2527 rated at 8,693 mAh/11.45V. This is similar to the current 16-inch MacBook Pro's battery, which is rated at 8,790 mAh/11.36V, <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106#s249816\">according to iFixit</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/sunwoda-a2527.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSunwoda Electronic is the same supplier that filed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/iphone-13-larger-battery-capacities/\">alleged iPhone 13 battery capacities</a> that were spotted in the same Chinese database earlier this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the filing is accurate, the next 16-inch MacBook Pro would have a slightly lower battery capacity than the existing model, potentially due to the notebook's rumored flatter design. However, any potential impact on battery life would likely be mitigated by the 16-inch MacBook Pro transitioning from Intel processors to more power-efficient Apple silicon. In fact, battery life could still end up being longer than the current generation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously reported that the redesigned MacBook Pro models will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/macbook-pro-64gb-ram-summer-2021/\">unveiled as early as this summer</a>, with leaker Jon Prosser expecting the MacBook Pro announcement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/wwdc-new-macbook-pro-models/\">to be part of WWDC next week</a>. Some other sources have suggested the new MacBook Pro models will not be announced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">until the second half of 2021</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWWDC kicks off with Apple's Keynote on Monday, June 7 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update 9:45 a.m.</b>: We've also found an entry for what seems likely to be the upcoming 14-inch MacBook Pro.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/sunwoda-a2527-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe listing for this battery, also from Sunwoda, was filed on March 30 and carries model identifier A2519. The battery is rated for 6,068 mAh at 11.47V. That's a bit higher than the 5,103 mAh rating of the current 13-inch MacBook Pro, but the redesigned chassis for the larger 14-inch display size will likely leave room for a larger battery. We saw a similar increase in battery capacity for the larger MacBook Pro when it moved from 15 inches to 16 inches.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/16-inch-macbook-pro-regulatory-filing/\">Next-Generation 16-Inch MacBook Pro Seemingly Filed in Regulatory Database Ahead of WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-16-inch-macbook-pro-seemingly-filed-in-regulatory-database-ahead-of-wwdc.2299069/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=78Pa8mzoivk:CbhNVzoV0vM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=78Pa8mzoivk:CbhNVzoV0vM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/78Pa8mzoivk\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"14aa5831ea340bb3ef84573983a75c9c970d223d0fac3a93bee5839c79ea78cd","category":"Apple"}
