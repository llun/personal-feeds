Torvalds specifically requested Rust compiler availability in the default kernel build environment to support such efforts—not to replace the entire source code of the Linux kernel with Rust-developed equivalents, but to make it possible for new development to work properly.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775163#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775163&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5708751bd2a7516b86b5dba5644eabf2df835094388a90c00cca039503c35b71","category":"Tech"}
