Thankfully, the news is better when it comes to electrifying another one of our public services—the school bus. On Thursday, Montgomery County—a wealthy Maryland suburb adjacent to Washington, DC—approved a contract to electrify its entire school bus fleet.</p>\n<p>School buses are an ideal candidate for electrification, given the frequent stops and the fact that the buses usually only run a couple of times each day. With more than 1,400 buses, the Montgomery County Public Schools Board of Education, which has more than 200 schools and 160,000 students, has one of the largest fleets of school buses in the country. Over the next four years it will get 326 new ones, the largest single order of EV buses by a school district in the country.</p>\n<p>The buses in question are Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouleys, built by Thomas Built Buses and equipped with electric powertrains made by Proterra. The Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley uses a 226kWh battery to achieve a range of up to 135 miles (217km), with up to 81 passengers aboard. The switch to electric power should cut the district's carbon emissions by 25,000 tons and reduce diesel particulate pollution.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745485#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745485&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
