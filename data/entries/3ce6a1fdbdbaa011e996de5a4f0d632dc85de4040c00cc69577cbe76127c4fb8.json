They found that children who undertook the project—including building their microscopes and conducting several at-home experiments—gained enhanced understanding of how microscopy works. It's part of an ongoing \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frugal_innovation\">frugal science</a>\" trend: using cheap consumer hardware and open-source software to build low-cost scientific instruments. The DIY tools are perfect for educational environments and for field use in developing countries.</p>\n<p>\"An understanding of science is crucial for decision-making and brings many benefits in everyday life, such as problem-solving and creativity,\" <a href=\"https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/3240.html?id=6301\">said co-author Timo Betz</a> of the University of Göttingen. \"Yet we find that many people, even politicians, feel excluded or do not have the opportunities to engage in scientific or critical thinking. We wanted to find a way to nurture natural curiosity, help people grasp fundamental principles, and see the potential of science.\" </p>\n<p>Perhaps the best known low-cost DIY instrument to date is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldscope\">Foldscope</a>, an optical microscope easily assembled out of a sheet of paper and a lens. It comes as a kit, which includes magnets so users can attach a smartphone to the Foldscope and take pictures of the magnified samples. It's robust enough to survive being dropped or getting wet, and the magnification is strong enough to view <em>E. coli</em> and malarial parasites in a sample.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777775#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777775&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ce6a1fdbdbaa011e996de5a4f0d632dc85de4040c00cc69577cbe76127c4fb8","category":"Tech"}
