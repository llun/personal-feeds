Let’s check it out below!<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0414.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks so much for giving us readers a chance to share our rides. My photography skills don’t match my love for this bike but I figured I’d send it in anyway.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0422.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0421.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Corsa started life as a frame that my dad found for me at the Boise Bicycle Project. Throughout college it evolved through many forms, spending most of its time as a rack-n’-pannier touring bike that I used for island-hopping in the San Juans. In recent years it’s settled into (I think) its final form as a country road rambler/lite gravel/coffee ride bike.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0413.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0412.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve never been able to find much info on the frame, but it’s lugged Tange construction with white paint that I can never keep clean and graphics that remind me of a pizza box.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0423.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The drivetrain is a 1×8 setup- the cranks are old 105 that came off of a bike that was ditched in our college garage, spinning on a Phil Wood bottom bracket that came on a Craigslist frame. A Shimano bar-end friction shifts a Claris derailleur, with a Wolf Tooth Roadlink letting it clear the Sunrace 11-40 8 speed cassette. The Problem Solvers chain guide was a recent addition after a particularly bad dropped chain and crash.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IMG_0415.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The cockpit (minus the Soma bars) was scrounged from dad’s parts bin. I especially dig the fluted seatpost. The wheels are my buddy’s old trainer wheels. Cheap Tektro cantis work great year after year. It’s a bit of a hodgepodge but it fits like a glove.</p>\n<p>Hope you like it!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0d71248fb1850ae40c51329bafb2cc5c1222174aa331726126296779ae0cf328","category":"Cycling"}
