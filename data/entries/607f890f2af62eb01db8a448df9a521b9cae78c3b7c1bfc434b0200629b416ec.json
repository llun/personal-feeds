Even though it's settling a US lawsuit, Epic says this same deal will apply to all <em>Fortnite</em> players globally.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744369#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744369&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"607f890f2af62eb01db8a448df9a521b9cae78c3b7c1bfc434b0200629b416ec","category":"Tech"}
