The large \"Subscribe\" button has also been eliminated in a design changes introduced to the Podcasts app in the iOS 14.5 update, in favor of a \"Latest Episode\" button.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/podcast-app-ios-14-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1931\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787927\" /><em><div class=\"center-wrap\">Podcast app interface in iOS 14.4</div></em>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen you tap on \"Latest Episode,\" the app now alerts you that you have \"Followed\" a podcast instead of \"Subscribed\" to it.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/podcast-app-ios-14-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1967\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787928\" /><em><div class=\"center-wrap\">Podcast app interface in iOS 14.5</div></em>\r\n<br/>\r\nOther apps like Spotify, Audible, Amazon Music, and Stitcher also use \"Follow\" wording instead of \"Subscribe.\" Edison Research's Tom Webster told <em>podnews</em> that Apple's shift from subscribe to follow could have an impact on the rest of the podcast industry.<blockquote>\"Today, Apple, Spotify, and YouTube are the three most widely used services to play podcasts, and now the word Subscribe means 'automatically download for free' in exactly none of them. Podcasters will have no choice but to adapt their language accordingly or risk confusing listeners.\"</blockquote>Right now, the Podcasts app is free and Apple has no paid podcast content, but rumors have suggested that Apple is working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-podcast-subscription-service/\">paid podcast subscription service</a> that would charge people to listen to podcasts.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith a paid subscription service, Apple could potentially lure high-profile creators with the promise of more money, stealing them away from other platforms like Spotify. The change in language facilitates the later introduction of a podcasting subscription service and will prevent confusion in the future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has made small wording changes in the past to clarify how purchases and downloads work. In the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, for example, the \"Free\" label <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/19/apple-replaces-free-button-with-get/\">was replaced with</a> \"Get\" in 2014 to make it clear that apps with no-upfront purchase costs could have in-app purchase options.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/podcast-app-wording-change-follow/\">Apple Podcasts App Lets Users &#039;Follow&#039; New Content Instead of &#039;Subscribe&#039; in iOS 14.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-podcasts-app-lets-users-follow-new-content-instead-of-subscribe-in-ios-14-5.2287744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eAcMI-KoL8c:t2g8NYkloHM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eAcMI-KoL8c:t2g8NYkloHM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/eAcMI-KoL8c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"90c3f3cee4e169d8fa300cb45fabc2d27b1312db48a3e4fd6e13be9b370169c8","category":"Apple"}
