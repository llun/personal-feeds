To get inside, two screws have to be removed from a panel on the bottom of the remote where the Lighting port is located, but <em>iFixit</em> found that it is not possible to access anything meaningful here without removing even more screws elsewhere.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Clickpad and buttons had to be removed with brute force, revealing more screws to remove. Once these were taken out, the battery and circuitry could be slid out of the bottom of the remote. <em>iFixit</em> noted that the entire disassembly of the new ‌Siri‌ Remote was made difficult by \"super tight\" tolerances.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>iFixit</em> discovered that the ‌Siri‌ Remote uses a \"tiny\" 1.52 Wh battery and it is not glued in place, which should make replacement somewhat easier.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/26/apple-tv-4k-teardown-ifixit/\">Like the previous model</a>, the second-generation ‌Apple TV‌ scored an eight out of 10 for repairability. The new remote, on the other hand, was very difficult to repair. Even a simple battery replacement requires total disassembly and risks damage.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/\">iFixit</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/apple-tv-4k-teardown-very-easy-remote-difficult/\">Apple TV 4K Very Easy to Repair but Siri Remote Battery Difficult to Replace, Teardown Shows</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-4k-very-easy-to-repair-but-siri-remote-battery-difficult-to-replace-teardown-shows.2297891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w4ct4eN4mvE:kWvuvYOV7FY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w4ct4eN4mvE:kWvuvYOV7FY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/w4ct4eN4mvE\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c24ba83d660b114d831d145bed69eb4ea3d9c9c9d8fd6afca962fd234f30adc7","category":"Apple"}
