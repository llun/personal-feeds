Apple began making Mac updates free with the launch of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, which also marked the shift from big cat names to California landmark names.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMavericks was free to download, and Apple has not charged for Mac software since then outside of the legacy Lion and Mountain Lion updates. Apple also used to have OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard available for a fee, but it is no longer purchasable.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/os-x/\">OS X</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/os-x-lion-mountain-lion-free-to-download/\">Apple Makes OS X Lion and Mountain Lion Free to Download</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-makes-os-x-lion-and-mountain-lion-free-to-download.2302848/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RvHoyhVW6Cs:Zk9bUG8xCmg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RvHoyhVW6Cs:Zk9bUG8xCmg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RvHoyhVW6Cs\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3f95a5874e267e5c6b8631ce22534ac2bcf50863c257f5fd917f859ea2af20d2","category":"Apple"}
