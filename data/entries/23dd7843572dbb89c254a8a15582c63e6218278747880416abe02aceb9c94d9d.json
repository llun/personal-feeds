Similar avatars also now appear on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tim_cook\">executives' social media accounts</a>, as the company prepares to preview new versions of its operating system software including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, which is expected to feature major updates to the Messages app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/wwdc-2021-memoji-leadership.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple has changed the profiles to Memojis on its leadership page once before. In 2018, Memoji avatars were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/16/apple-execs-memoji-avatars/\">used</a> to celebrate World Emoji Day, the year that Memojis were an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> X feature coming in iOS 12. On that occasion, just the heads were replaced with Memojis, leaving the real shoulders in place. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis time around, the photos have been replaced wholesale with disembodied heads against dark backgrounds, reflecting the wider use of more advanced Memoji technology in Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a> promotional material.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is holding a virtual keynote that will take place on Monday, June 7, with the event set to give us our first look at new operating system updates. We don't know a lot about this year's event, but everything that we're expecting to see based on rumors can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">dedicated roundup</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple plans to live stream the WWDC keynote on its website, the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>‌ app, and YouTube, but for those unable to watch, we'll be covering the event on MacRumors.com and through the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-uses-memojis-leadership-profiles-wwdc/\">Apple Updates Leadership Page With Memojis for Execs Ahead of WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-leadership-page-with-memojis-for-execs-ahead-of-wwdc.2299485/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZZZLy9hjghA:SJdxlPqi70g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZZZLy9hjghA:SJdxlPqi70g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZZZLy9hjghA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23dd7843572dbb89c254a8a15582c63e6218278747880416abe02aceb9c94d9d","category":"Apple"}
