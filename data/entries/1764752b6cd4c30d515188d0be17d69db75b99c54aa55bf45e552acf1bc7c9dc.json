The espionage group is exploiting\nfour newly-discovered flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server email\nsoftware, and has seeded hundreds of thousands of victim\norganizations worldwide with tools that give the attackers total,\nremote control over affected systems. […]</p>\n\n<p>In each incident, the intruders have left behind a “web shell,” an\neasy-to-use, password-protected hacking tool that can be accessed\nover the Internet from any browser. The web shell gives the\nattackers administrative access to the victim’s computer servers.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, two cybersecurity experts\nwho’ve briefed U.S. national security advisors on the attack told\nKrebsOnSecurity the Chinese hacking group thought to be\nresponsible has seized control over “hundreds of thousands” of\nMicrosoft Exchange Servers worldwide — with each victim system\nrepresenting approximately one organization that uses Exchange to\nprocess email.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Microsoft Windows and Exchange have always been insecure, and probably always will be. It’s amazing how many widely-publicized hacks you can ignore if you just never use Windows or use Exchange server software. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/12/21/solarwinds-security-consulting\">The massive SolarWinds hack</a> exposed last month only affected organizations running Microsoft’s IT infrastructure too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘At Least 30,000 U.S. Organizations Newly Hacked via Holes in Microsoft’s Email Software’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/06/30k-exchange-server-hack\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1764752b6cd4c30d515188d0be17d69db75b99c54aa55bf45e552acf1bc7c9dc","category":"Tech"}
