Here’s the product blip from Boone:</p>\n<blockquote><p>These are a new set of cranks that we’ve developed that are CNC machined out of billet aluminum.  The unique curve of these cranks not only provides excellent aerodynamic drag reduction but also looks great on any bike.  They are available in polished finish  These cranks weigh in at 245 grams per arm and measure 175 mm (6.89 in) in length.  The internal spline attachment we machined for these cranks is compatible with BB30 standard bottom brackets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While these cranks aren’t as wild looking as the Twist cranks, they are a very unique design. The price? $495 direct from <a href=\"https://booneti.com/products/cranx-machined-aluminum-bike-cranks\" target=\"_blank\">Boone Technologies</a>…</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a3f199eabc4eb8518ee9bb422f4290ce6fcbbe9d503b79cfa05f523cecb484de","category":"Cycling"}
