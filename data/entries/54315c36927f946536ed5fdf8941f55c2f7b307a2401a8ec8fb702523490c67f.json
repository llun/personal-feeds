Two of those films are by producer/director/person-with-a-dream Christopher Bickel, who finished his sophomore full-length movie effort <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13997634/\"><em>Bad Girls</em></a> just this month.</p>\n<p><em>Bad Girls</em> is an over-the-top <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindhouse\">grindhouse</a> jam, packed full of sex, drugs, loud music, and ultraviolent action.
