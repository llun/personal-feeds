{"title":"Forget trailers: The best upcoming games we played at this year’s E3","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773854","date":1623862802000,"content":"<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e3-2021-games-800x471.jpg\" /><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/e3-2021-games.jpg\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> In another year, these weird games wouldn't necessarily rise to the top of our \"best of E3\" list. But when the biggest gaming companies focus almost exclusively on non-playable trailers, our picks have to go to the games we can personally test.

Carefully staging bluster is easy; getting Ars Technica staffers to agree that the games in question are fun or interesting to play is not.</p>\n<p>While a post-pandemic landscape has led more gamemakers to begin to offer remote game demos, none of the industry's current \"triple-A\" titans offered me a way to play their most-hyped titles, the ones typically slated to launch a few months after a big June showcase. Sorry, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/metroid-dread-brings-nintendos-classic-back-as-a-2d-sequel-on-october-8/\"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/every-trailer-and-announcement-from-microsoft-and-bethesdas-e3-showcase/\"><em>Age of Empires 4</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Even so, plenty of other gamemakers were happy to offer me 30-minute slices of their cherished games-to-be, whether via direct downloads or cloud-streamed demos on services like Parsec. No, these are not blockbusters by any stretch, but guess what, games companies? <em>You had your chance</em>. And the indies took it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773854#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773854&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9facf5669b93849f1e5a096598bf68594ee946f507ee04cdae48077f21fe860e","category":"Tech"}
