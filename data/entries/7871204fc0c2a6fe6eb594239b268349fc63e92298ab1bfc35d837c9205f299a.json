(credit: Pixel Reed, PID Games)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The latest rendition of <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam's annual Summer Sale</a> has been underway for about a week now, and, as usual, it's discounted virtually everything on the PC games store. But while the <em>Halo</em>s, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>s, and other mega-hits of the world may get the most front-page attention, the sheer breadth of the sale means that a truckload of lesser-known but more-than-worthwhile games have dropped to more approachable prices as well. To assist those who'd like to expand their interactive palate, I've rounded up a collection of recent under-the-radar games that are both worth your time and nicely discounted.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this list isn't comprehensive. There are several thousand games on sale, and, unfortunately, we can't play everything. (As always, feel free to share your own recommendations below.) Definitions of \"under-the-radar\" may differ, but the vast majority of this list consists of games we haven't covered previously on Ars, and I've generally tried to avoid more well-publicized indies like Ars <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">GOTY winners <em>Hades</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2018/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Celeste</em></a>. So, allow us to shine a light on some good games that may not immediately seem laudable. Steam's sale ends on July 8, but you can consider these recommendations valid for afterwards as well.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.</em></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776268#p3\">Read 71 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776268&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeff Dunn","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7871204fc0c2a6fe6eb594239b268349fc63e92298ab1bfc35d837c9205f299a","category":"Tech"}
