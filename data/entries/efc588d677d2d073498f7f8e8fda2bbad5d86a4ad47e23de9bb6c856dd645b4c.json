(credit: Waymo)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>On Thursday morning, Waymo announced that it is working with trucking company JB Hunt to autonomously haul cargo loads in Texas. Class 8 JB Hunt trucks equipped with the autonomous driving software and hardware system called Waymo Driver will operate on I-45 in Texas, taking cargo between Houston and Fort Worth.</p>\n<p>However, the trucks will still carry humans—a trained truck driver and Waymo technicians—to supervise and take over if necessary.</p>\n<p>Although Waymo is better known for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/\">the autonomous taxi service it operates in a suburb of Phoenix</a>, the company started experimenting with adding its autonomous technology to freight haulers several years ago. And in 2018, it began testing those trucks in the Atlanta area. What makes today's news more notable is the partnership with a major truck operator.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772055#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772055&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
