{"title":"Another Take on Amazon’s Sidewalk Mesh Network","link":"https://slate.com/technology/2021/06/amazon-sidewalk-mesh-network-experiment-privacy.html","date":1622752077000,"content":"\n<p>Josephine Wolff, writing for Slate:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By all means, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22463257/amazon-sidewalk-privacy-how-to-opt-out\">opt out</a> of Amazon Sidewalk if anything about\nthis program makes you uncomfortable or if (despite already owning\na Ring or Echo) you don’t trust the company enough to share a\nlittle of your home network with your neighbors safely. You’re\nunder no obligation to participate in this mesh networking\nexperiment, and it probably would have made more sense for Amazon\nto at least launch the program with an opt-in model that gave\npeople more time to learn about how it works and whether they want\nto be involved.</p>\n\n<p>But if you’re just learning about mesh networks for the first time\nand aren’t sure what to think, or whether this is something to be\nvery worried about, I really don’t think it is. If you’ve already\nreconciled yourself to the privacy implications of owning an Echo\nor a Ring, the additional privacy and security drawbacks of\nparticipating in Sidewalk seem very limited and the benefits are\npotentially considerable, for you and for everyone around you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like this take. The thing to consider is whether you trust Echo and Ring devices with your privacy. If you do, you might as well participate in Sidewalk.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/03/another-take-on-amazon-sidewalk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a2c7000b9bc0089f7b9df1aac9db015aa17e16c341c75ffe04be7044bd92fd23","category":"Tech"}
