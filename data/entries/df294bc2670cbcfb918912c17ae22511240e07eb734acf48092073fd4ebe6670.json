The Pro+ keyboards feature integrated trackpads and came out ahead of when Apple added dedicated trackpad support to iPadOS.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/03/brydgeprotopdownkeyboard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-735429\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe software available from Brydge adds native multi-touch capabilities and should much improve the trackpad experience of the Pro+ keyboard. We reviewed the keyboard back in March and found the trackpad to be inferior as it wasn't initially designed with Apple's integrations in mind.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Brydge, the firmware will bring a \"natural\" multi-touch experience, with the update available through the Brydge Connect app. Using the new beta firmware requires customers to have the iPadOS 14.5 update installed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBrydge Pro+ keyboard users who want to try out the new firmware update can <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/pages/multi-touch-beta\">sign up on the Brydge website</a>. The first 500 who sign up for the public beta will be able to access the firmware on February 24, while others will get access on March 3.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBrydge today also announced the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-10-2-max\">10.2 MAX+ wireless keyboard case with trackpad</a>, which is designed to work with the 7th and 8th-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/brydge-max-10-2-keyboard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784149\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nPriced at &#36;130, the 10.2 MAX+ has a built-in native multi-touch trackpad and an integrated backlit keyboard, plus it offers full device protection. Brydge says that it is designed to combine the functionality of a Brydge keyboard with the protection of OtterBox. The 10.2 MAX+ can be <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-10-2-max\">pre-ordered from the Brydge website</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brydge/\">Brydge</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/brydge-multi-touch-firmware-beta/\">Brydge Brings Multi-Touch Support to Pro+ Keyboards, Debuts New 10.2-Inch Max+ Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/brydge-brings-multi-touch-support-to-pro-keyboards-debuts-new-10-2-inch-max-model.2285107/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=u5S9tZOOOzw:30nMKAzdfPQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=u5S9tZOOOzw:30nMKAzdfPQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/u5S9tZOOOzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df294bc2670cbcfb918912c17ae22511240e07eb734acf48092073fd4ebe6670","category":"Apple"}
