With that, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour</a> racing is hotting up and we’re starting to catch glimpses of new bikes being ridden ahead of official launches.</p>\n<p>This week we’ve seen an updated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pinarello-dogma-f14/\">Pinarello Dogma</a> and a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/merida-scultura-5/\">Merida Scultura</a>, and we’ll almost certainly see a few more new bits of tech ahead of the most important race of the season. Watch this space, as always.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the WorldTour, news also broke this week that the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/uci-bans-supersapiens/\">UCI has banned glucose and lactate monitoring devices</a> from use in competition. That means devices such as those made by brands like Supersapiens can no longer be used in races.</p>\n<p>This week also saw Schwalbe launch a new gravel tyre, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-g-one-r/\">G-One R</a>. Said to be faster, lighter and grippier all at the same time, we’ll be putting it through its paces soon to see whether that all comes at the expense of durability.</p>\n<p>Specialized also launched its lightest ever cross-country shoe, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-s-works-exos-shoes/\">S-Works Exos Evo</a>. Based on the original <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/specialized-s-works-exos-shoes-review/\">S-Works Exos road shoe</a>, it uses a Dyneema fabric on the uppers that reduces weight (and increases price) dramatically.</p>\n<p>And, finally, Scott revealed its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-scott-spark-rc-spark-900/\">2022 Spark RC</a> and Spark 900 cross-country and trail bikes. With the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tokyo-2020/\">Tokyo Olympics</a> on the horizon, I’ve no doubt we’ll be seeing more new bikes like this in the near future too.</p>\n<p>And if all that hasn’t satiated your hunger for new cycling tech, here’s some more…</p>\n<h2>NoPinz Flow skinsuit and Flow shoe covers</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Flow suit and Flow covers by NoPinz make up the British brand’s fastest time-trial kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yogamaya von Hippel / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>NoPinz’ top-of-the-range skinsuit, the Flow, is said to be the fastest (most aerodynamically efficient) skinsuit the British brand has ever developed.</p>\n<p>Designed in conjunction with UK-based aero experts Aerocoach – another British brand whose aero wheels and kit have been making waves in WorldTour time trials – the Flow suit promises a 7.4-watt saving versus the brand’s previous best skinsuit, the Tripsuit.</p>\n<p>To put that into context, that’s said to be worth around 12 seconds in a 10-mile time trial.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Flow covers comprise three different aero fabrics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yogamaya von Hippel / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Leaving no stone unturned, we also have a set of NoPinz Flow shoe covers.</p>\n<p><span>The Flow covers use three different, strategically placed fabrics to save a claimed 7.1 watts at 45kph, versus bare legs.

Due to the way the drops flare out from the ramps, though, the position of the hoods ends up being around 24cm in width. That’s pretty narrow, for a road bike anyway.\n<p>The bar has a traditional bend drop with a depth of 120mm and a reach of 70mm. It uses a standard 31.8mm clamping area, so should work with any standard stem.</p>\n<p>Of course, I’ll freely admit it looks a bit ridiculous on a road bike – the oversized Shimano 105 R7000 hydraulic shift/brake levers look enormous on it – but my first few test rides suggest that, surprisingly, the handling isn’t too bad at all.</p>\n<p>And, as you’d expect, it also feels very fast when you’re tucked down into an aero position.
