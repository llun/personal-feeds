It is not yet clear exactly when the cut-off date for created Shortcuts links is, but broadly, links created within the past week seem to be unaffected and continue to work correctly. Apple's own in-app gallery for downloading Shortcuts is also still working as expected.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen attempting to add a Shortcut from an affected &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; link, users are now presented with an error message in the Shortcuts app that reads \"Shortcut Not Found: The shortcut link may be invalid, or it may have been deleted.\" The change has since been flagged by users on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/mbou6h/shortcut_icloud_links_broken_right_now_for_anyone/\">Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rodrigoaraujo/status/1374689829955497986?s=21\">Twitter</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It seems shortcuts’ links dating as far as last week have all been invalidated.
