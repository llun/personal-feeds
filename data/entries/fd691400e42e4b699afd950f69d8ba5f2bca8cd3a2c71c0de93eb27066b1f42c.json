It’s a glitchy, 10-year-old underdog of a game with a cult following of programmers, engineers, astronaut candidates, and your typical lay explosion enthusiasts, and it has a unique and active community of modders who’ve been fixing bugs, adding new features, and generally keeping the game fresh for nearly a decade.</p>\n<p>In the game, you are the omniscient director of a space program composed of literal little green men (and beloved little green woman Valentina Kerman—we see you, trailblazer) that you send skyward in spacecraft of your own design. It often feels like watching those blurry old videos of rockets launching only to come straight back down in an explosion of fiery schadenfreude: you feel a little bit frightened, a little bit sadistic, and you really want to try it again.</p>\n<h2>Art imitates life</h2>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774406#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774406&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd691400e42e4b699afd950f69d8ba5f2bca8cd3a2c71c0de93eb27066b1f42c","category":"Tech"}
