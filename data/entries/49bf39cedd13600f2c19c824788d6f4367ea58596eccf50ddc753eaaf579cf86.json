More women are finding cycling, the joy and the freedom that accompanies hopping on a bike and taking off on an adventure. What continues to bring more women to cycling is the community, the atmosphere that comes along with riding a bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get a sense of where the cycling industry stands when it comes to female-identifying cyclists Abby chatted with two women who are immersed in the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elorieslater/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Elorie Slater</a>, marketing manager of <a href=\"https://www.pivotcycles.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pivot Cycles</a>, has put a lot of thought into how to get more female-identifying riders on bikes. Through her experience at a bike shop and within the marketing world of cycling she has connected with other cycling companies to put aside their differences and band together to make cycling a more inclusive and welcome environment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.huntbikewheels.cc/blogs/the-rider-firm-people/luisa-grappone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Luisa Grappone</a>, an aerospace engineer for Hunt bike wheels, came to the cycling industry after working on planes. She has a unique perspective of being a woman in a male dominate field. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We at CyclingTips are proud to bring more women&#8217;s voices in front of the cycling world and continue to work towards growing cycling to include everyone who loves bikes, just like us. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<iframe style=\"border: none\" src=\"//html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/18231149/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/\" height=\"90\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" oallowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/cyclingtips-podcast-international-womens-day-special/\">CyclingTips Podcast: International Women&#8217;s Day Special</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"49bf39cedd13600f2c19c824788d6f4367ea58596eccf50ddc753eaaf579cf86","category":"Cycling"}
