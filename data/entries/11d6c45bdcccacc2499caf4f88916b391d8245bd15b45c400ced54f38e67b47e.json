So it&rsquo;s only natural that Will-i-am wants to turn them into high-priced tech fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After trying out<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/220268/will-i-am-talks-tech-new-phone-accessories-at-macworld-iworld-video.html\"> iPhone camera accessories and cases</a>, and appearing on Apple&rsquo;s short-lived reality competition show <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229615/why-apples-planet-of-the-apps-totally-misses-the-point-of-original-programming.html\">Planet of the Apps</a>, Will.i.am is launching Xupermask in conjunction with Honeywell, which is best known for Wi-Fi humidifiers, air purifiers, and <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3391456/honeywell-home-t9-smart-thermostat-review.html\">thermostats</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xupermask looks more like a gas mask than a Covid-era cloth face mask and it&rsquo;s loaded with tech: Bluetooth, noise-canceling headphones, a trio of dual-speed fans, a Honeywell HEPA filtration system, LED lights, and seven hours of battery life. You can connect to your iPhone to play music and take calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Xupermask fits over your ears and has a seal over the nose to prevent fogging, which is actually a serious issue with many other masks. The filters are replaceable (you get three at purchase) and the battery is rechargeable via USB. It looks a little like the Avengers Endgame masks without a shield, which makes sense because they were designed by costume designer&nbsp;Jose Fernandez, who created Elon Musk&rsquo;s&nbsp;SpaceX suits&nbsp;and worked on several Marvel Studios films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/style/william-face-mask.html&amp;xcust=1-1-342715-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will.i.am told The New York Times</a> that he &ldquo;wanted to make a mask to fit the era that we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo; The former Black Eyed Peas rapper doesn&rsquo;t have the best track record <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2834672/williams-beast-of-a-smartwatch-makes-calls-and-more-without-needing-a-phone.html\">with his tech moonshots</a>, but he&rsquo;s betting that masks are here to stay. He sees it as a new category of fashion like sneakers, but it&rsquo;s hard to overlook the high-priced and high-tech wearable tie-in as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after Apple sold out of its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">$549 AirPods Max headphones</a> in about an hour, it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite so crazy. The Xupermask will launch on April 8 at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.xupermask.com&amp;xcust=1-1-342715-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">xupermask.com</a>.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Apple just made its long-rumored AirTags trackers completely unnecessary","siteHash":"ff31764ad69f885eda67d1c9620083f9441c698a9d37b07ed379ca736b955089","entryHash":"11d6c45bdcccacc2499caf4f88916b391d8245bd15b45c400ced54f38e67b47e","category":"Apple"}
