Apple often releases security updates for older devices that are no longer able to get the current version of iOS in order to keep users protected from malware and other security vulnerabilities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\">security support document</a> says that the update addresses three vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution. Two of them that affected WebKit may have been actively exploited. One of these vulnerabilities was fixed in iOS 14.6, and the other two are likely to be addressed in iOS 14.7.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-releases-ios-12-5-4-for-older-iphones/\">Apple Releases iOS and iPadOS 12.5.4 Security Fix for Older iPhones and iPads</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-and-ipados-12-5-4-security-fix-for-older-iphones-and-ipads.2300885/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=M8z5FrA2nKc:VIqNDg45qUI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=M8z5FrA2nKc:VIqNDg45qUI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/M8z5FrA2nKc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ba03caa3fdc745769bc2a0d4c5a5a8b8f0c5222c179bb4e51c9ca028c5139cd","category":"Apple"}
