Although he is imprisoned, he ultimately escapes before standing trial and goes on to pull off many other colorful heists. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764063#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764063&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86c6b803c87c35544ca66d41e64f6d8b2082798fcabcccdf63a31b45b1869cfe","category":"Tech"}
