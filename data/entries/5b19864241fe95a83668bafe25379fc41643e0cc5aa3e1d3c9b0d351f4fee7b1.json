Alice Barnes (Canyon-SRAM) won the bunch sprint to take second on the stage ahead of Amalie Dideriksen (Trek-Segafredo) in third. Elise Chabbey (Canyon-SRAM) finished ahead of Grace Brown (Team BikeExchange) and took over the race lead ahead of stage 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A break of three was up against an active peloton with 25 km to go. A crash with 23 km to go created a split in the peloton with a handful of favourites finding themselves distanced from the peloton. Anna van der Breggen and three of her SD Worx teammates tried to extend their distance from the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out front Anastasiia Chursina (Alé BTC Ljubljana) fought to remain ahead of the peloton behind without her two breakaway companions. The race behind came back together, with Team BikeExchange working to keep the race leader Brown at the head of the race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside 1 km to go Chursina led the race by over a minute, with Canyon-SRAM and SD Worx chasing down the lone rider. Barnes won the sprint for second with Dideriksen taking third on the day. </p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Vuelta a Burgos Feminas (2.WWT)\n                                                    <span>Pedrosa de Valdeporres → Villarcayo</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255935\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">CHURSINA Anastasiia</a>\n                                            <span>Alé BTC Ljubljana</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>02:29:28</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">BARNES Alice</a>\n                                            <span>Canyon SRAM Racing</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:01:11</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">DIDERIKSEN Amalie</a>\n                                            <span>Trek-Segafredo Women </span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:01:11</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>4</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">SIERRA Arlenis</a>\n                                            <span>A.R.
