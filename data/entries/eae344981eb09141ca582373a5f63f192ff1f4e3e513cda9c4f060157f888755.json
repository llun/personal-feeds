The company will likely take the opportunity of the new models based on Apple silicon to introduce new designs, features, and refinements. This article keeps track of the most creditable reports of the upcoming MacBook Pro, so turn to this page for the latest and greatest. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Sizes, design and colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that Apple will release a “redesigned” MacBook Pro this summer. It will be available in 14- and 16-inch models; Gurman did not state if the current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234838/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1-review-amazing-breakthroughs-in-processing-and-battery-performance.html\">13-inch M1 MacBook Pro</a> will remain in the lineup or be replaced by the 14-inch models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ming Chi-Kuo said in a research note  (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>) that the laptop will see a redesign in 2021. In an earlier note from May 2020 (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/07/kuo-apple-mini-led-products-q3-2020-debut/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>), Kuo said that Apple is working on a 14-inch MacBook Pro—essentially, a transformation of the higher-end 13-inch models, similar to what happened when Apple released the 16-inch MacBook Pro to replace the 15-inch models. It’s unclear if the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234838/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1-review-amazing-breakthroughs-in-processing-and-battery-performance.html\">lower-end 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> would remain in the lineup if a 14-inch version is revealed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346093/the-next-macbook-could-have-white-bezels-to-match-the-imac.html\">reports</a> that Apple will release a MacBook Air or a reintroduction of the MacBook in color offerings and a white bezel similar to those of the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344032/apple-24-inch-imac-display-m1-specs-storage-ports-ram-ethernet-colors-touch-id.html\">24-inch iMac</a>. If Apple is using colors in its consumer-level products, it’s possible that Apple sticks with the space gray and silver options for the higher-end, which includes the MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Mini LED displays</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2020, analyst Ming Chi-Kuo released a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233912/report-apple-to-feature-six-products-with-mini-leds-including-a-14-1-inch-macbook-pro.html\">note</a> reporting on Apple’s use of mini LEDs in new products, including the 2021 versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. Apple already launched its first mini LED screen in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343706/ipad-pro-2021-faq-price-specs-features-release-date.html\">12.9-inch iPad Pro</a>, so it’s clear Apple is already working on the tech. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mini-LED is a backlighting technology for displays, but several more LEDs are used than what is currently implemented. This results in better control of the backlight, better image contrast, and greater dynamic range. If Apple’s description of the iPad Pro is any indication, the new display will deliver “true-to-life detail with a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio … (and) breathtaking 1000 nits of full‑screen brightness and 1600 nits of peak brightness.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: MagSafe and ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that the MacBook Pro that will be released this summer will have a MagSafe charger, an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and “more Thunderbolt ports” (the current 13-inch MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports; the current Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro has four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ming Chi-Kuo (via <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacRumors</a>) said in a research note that MagSafe will be on the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro. Introduced in Mac laptops in 2006, MagSafe was a magnetic power adapter connector that could easily disconnect from the laptop using non-axial force—tugs from angles other than straight away. Its implementation meant that if the laptop was plugged in and for whatever reason, the cable was tripped over or pulled, the connection would break and the laptop would be spared from <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/225120/will-your-new-macbook-crash-to-the-ground-without-magsafe-yes.html\">flying off the work surface</a>. MagSafe was a separate, dedicated plug for power, however, and disappeared when Apple switched to USB-C connectors in 2016. The USB-C connectors support battery charging but do not have a breakaway connector.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/13-inch-macbook-pro-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption><p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports. Chances are a rumored 14-inch model will also have two ports.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has transitioned to Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports in its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345721/m1-mac-macbook-imac-mac-mini-cpu-gpu-memory-storage-benchmarks-storage-ports-price.html\">M1 Macs</a>, and Apple will continue with this in upcoming models. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: End of the Touch Bar</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Touch Bar is a polarizing feature of the higher-end MacBook Pro models—those who dislike it are quite expressive about it, while people who like it don’t really say much (at least it seems that way). In a January 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/235020/apples-next-m1-macbook-pros-might-dump-the-touch-bar-revive-magsafe.html\">note</a>, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the OLED Touch Bar will be replaced by function keys. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234373/the-switch-to-apple-silicon-will-the-touch-bar-survive.html\">introduced the Touch Bar in 2016</a> to replace the function keys with “a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display,” but it has been a decisive feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/macbook-pro-touchbar-2019.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption>The Touch Bar’s days appear to be numbered.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: M-series processor and other specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The speculation for Apple silicon in the higher-end MacBook Pro models is that Apple will use this opportunity to reveal the next in line in the M-series. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that Apple’s “redesigned” 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro will have Apple’s system on a chip that features a 10-core CPU (eight performance cores and two efficiency cores), 16 or 32 graphics core options, a maximum of 64GB of memory, and an “improved Neural Engine.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s 8-core M1 system on a chip (SoC) made its debut in low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro last fall. Apple has not revealed the update cycle for its SoCs, so it’s unknown if the M1 will be replaced by a new chip after a year or two. When those laptops used Intel processors, Apple updated them in a roughly annual cycle (often longer than 12 months, but not much longer).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been rumored to be including 5G and Face ID support in its laptops, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> that those features do not appear “to be coming soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 MacBook Pro: Price and release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346129-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">According</a> to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will release the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with Apple silicon this summer. Prices have not been released. It is not clear if the current 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro will remain in the lineup.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"eae344981eb09141ca582373a5f63f192ff1f4e3e513cda9c4f060157f888755","category":"Apple"}
