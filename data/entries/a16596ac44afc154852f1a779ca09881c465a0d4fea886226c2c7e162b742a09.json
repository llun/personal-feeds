The new round of job creation will focus on innovations from 5G, next-generation silicon, and AI. CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> says that as countries slowly recover from the global health crisis, Apple is doubling down on its own responsibility to build a better tomorrow.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,\" said ‌Tim Cook‌, Apple's CEO. \"We're creating jobs in cutting-edge fields — from 5G to silicon engineering to artificial intelligence — investing in the next generation of innovative new businesses, and in all our work, building toward a greener and more equitable future.</blockquote>As part of today's announcement, Apple also unveiled its plan to invest over $1 billion in North Carolina and build a new engineering and research center in the Research Triangle area. This investment alone will create at least 3,000 new jobs, in addition to a $100 million support fund for local schools and communities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple will also establish a $100 million fund to support schools and community initiatives in the greater Raleigh-Durham area and across the state, and will be contributing over $110 million in infrastructure spending to the 80 North Carolina counties with the greatest need — funds that will go toward broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools. When up and running, Apple’s investments are expected to generate over $1.5 billion in economic benefits annually for North Carolina.</blockquote><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-investment-create-20000-jobs/\">Apple Announces $430 Billion Investment to Create 20,000 US Jobs Over Next Five Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-430-billion-investment-to-create-20-000-us-jobs-over-next-five-years.2293293/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=egz7igWrPrg:bCmax292XDg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=egz7igWrPrg:bCmax292XDg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/egz7igWrPrg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a16596ac44afc154852f1a779ca09881c465a0d4fea886226c2c7e162b742a09","category":"Apple"}
