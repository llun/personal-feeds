They replied with some history of this project, as well as some high res shots, so if you&#8217;re tired of squinting at Instagram photos, check out the full story below!<span id=\"more-206737\"></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206738\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0047.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;So basically, the stem rack isn’t a new idea but this is our interpretation of it. A customer in the US commissioned the stem for his Tomii canvas because he wanted the integrated Chris King headset cover (a known feature of our bikes for at least 6 years) whilst in conversation, he said that he wanted a way to secure his bar bag to allow the use of the tops of his handlebars. We mentioned this style of rack-mounted from the bar clamp bolts of the stem, he said let’s do it, so here it is. It’s all 4130 Chromoly with fillet-brazed construction, it’s also deliberately the correct size tubing to work with Voile rack straps. It piggybacks from the paragon stem clamp fasteners. The customer is having a custom bag made to suit the rack but there is clearly scope for him to carry a lot more on this thing.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206741\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/IMG-0048.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>We have had plenty of enquiries about this so plans are afoot to make a universal version of this setup which should work with most 4 bolt stems.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206740\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/7D5A123E-3E82-4A1B-AF10-D22BD16F8445.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Keep your eyes peeled on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/augustbicycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">August Bicycles&#8217; Instagram</a> for updates to this Stem Rack as events warrant.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"eac49b8bf59ee1fcdb1cfc34ca07bd2c559149502b952bad79ba8ac021662583","category":"Cycling"}
