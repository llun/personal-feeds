Engraved ‌AirTags‌ are only available from Apple and are backordered until June.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome customers in the United States <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/airtags-arriving-early-to-some-customers/\">began receiving AirTags early</a> yesterday as retailers like Best Buy shipped earlier than expected, but customers in New Zealand and Australia will be getting the first engraved ‌AirTags‌ direct from Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing New Zealand and Australia, ‌AirTags‌ sales and deliveries will begin in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and more, with the North America launch coming last.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're in Australia and New Zealand and received your ‌AirTags‌ already, make sure to share photos below and let us know what you think as we'll be putting together a list of first impressions if we can get enough opinions on ‌AirTags‌ from <em>MacRumors</em> readers.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/airtags-arriving-new-zealand-australia/\">AirTags and Purple iPhone 12 Models Start Arriving to Customers in New Zealand and Australia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtags-and-purple-iphone-12-models-start-arriving-to-customers-in-new-zealand-and-australia.2293966/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1hYtt5aCIHE:y1BqaJncmSo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1hYtt5aCIHE:y1BqaJncmSo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1hYtt5aCIHE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"293a12bafec108633ed0b3dd95d85068dbdbede9140dcf7fa2f06a1f70782878","category":"Apple"}
