Underneath the tread, you’ll find Schwalbe’s V-Guard strip to add puncture protection.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Schwalbe says the G-One R is for fast gravel riding, with a mix of 60% dirt and 40% tarmac.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tyre choice is critical when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-setup/\">gravel bike setup</a> and Schwalbe tells us the G-One R is aimed at riders looking for a tyre that’s ideal for light off-road terrain, gravel roads and tarmac (they say a 60/40 split between gravel and road).</p>\n<p>In other words, the performance characteristics are aimed at not slowing you down on the tarmac yet still allowing you to let rip when you hit the dirt. We’ve got a pair here for test, so we’ll let you know how these hold up when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advertising-feature/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the new tyre is available in Scwalbe’s TLE (Tubeless Easy) construction, in two 700c sizes: 700 x 40mm (1.5in) or 700 x 45mm (1.7in).</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">Best gravel bikes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">Best gravel bike wheels</a></li>\n</ul><p>The 40mm tyre has a maximum pressure of 65psi/4.5 bar, while the 45mm option has a maximum stated pressure of 55psi/4bar.</p>\n<p>Claimed weight is 520g for the 45m tyre, while the 40mm tyre we have here tips our scales at 487g.</p>\n<p>Finally, the new Schwalbe G-One R is priced at £69.99 / €69.90 / $87.99 per tyre.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Warren Rossiter","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"34a140da78f23a2bb7e6a4bae9af49ef7d95dd37ecd4d4f72048ff2d44989236","category":"Cycling"}
