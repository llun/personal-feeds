It's worth noting, again, that this feature will be available to all users, despite some speculation that YouTube may have limited picture-in-picture support for only paying subscribers.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Picture-in-Picture (PiP) allows users to watch YouTube videos in a small mini player while simultaneously browsing outside of the YouTube app on their mobile device. Weâ€™re starting to roll out PiP for YouTube Premium members on iOS and plan to launch PiP for all US iOS users as well.</blockquote>YouTube picture-in-picture has been a constant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/18/picture-in-picture-ios-14-youtube-safari/\">back and forth game</a>, with it sometimes working via the YouTube website on Safari. Some users have found <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/picture-in-picture-fix-youtube/\">creative workarounds utilizing Shortcuts</a> to turn off built-in parameters on the YouTube site that disables picture-in-picture. Now, though, with official support rolling out and soon to be more widespread, those workarounds will no longer be needed.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/picture-in-picture/\">Picture in Picture</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/youtube-pip-support-rolling-out/\">YouTube Says iOS Picture-in-Picture Coming to All US Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-says-ios-picture-in-picture-coming-to-all-us-users.2301430/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AGq0XSZjt7w:V9GKCKnSr3k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AGq0XSZjt7w:V9GKCKnSr3k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AGq0XSZjt7w\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee3c2fea02e7ba7736bcb64425a5097e17596a8f43d936a9ae7d0fd063e68d53","category":"Apple"}
