In addition, Kuo said that the new ‌iPad mini‌ in the second half of this year will further help grow the ‌iPad‌ business.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/28/ipad-mini-6-release-date-rumors/\">Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/12/imac-ipad-air-ipad-mini-late-2020/\"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> had previously indicated that the new ‌iPad mini‌ would launch in the first half of this year. Possibly due to supply restraints, the new low-cost ‌iPad‌ now seems to have been delayed to the second half of 2021. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌iPad mini‌ is expected to feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/ipad-mini-6-slim-bezels-march-launch/\">8.4-inch display with slimmer bezels</a> and continue to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> Home Button and a Lightning port. The new ‌iPad‌ could be a disappointment for customers hoping the smallest form-factor ‌iPad‌ would benefit from a major redesign, such as the changes seen with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and ‌iPad Pro‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore long-term, Kuo reports that Apple is working on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/\">iPad mini with a mini-LED display</a>, which recently debuted in the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌. Compared to the current LCD displays, mini-LED on the ‌iPad mini‌ would help deliver richer blacks, while providing improved contrast and HDR. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/kuo-ipad-mini-6-delayed-second-half-of-2021/\">Kuo: iPad Mini 6 Delayed Until Second Half of 2021</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-ipad-mini-6-delayed-until-second-half-of-2021.2294581/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cdzpBwcWK5g:kDhsfiGsI9o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cdzpBwcWK5g:kDhsfiGsI9o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cdzpBwcWK5g\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2e2fffdbb225ec1e2d70914e7926fcc5ccdafc8cfc1e0a69cbc966a3721ac3c9","category":"Apple"}
