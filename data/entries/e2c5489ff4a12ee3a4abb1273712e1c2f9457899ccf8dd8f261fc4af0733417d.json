As <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307929/sdcc-e3-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-virtual-events\">The Verge</a></em> points out, San Diego Comic Con, Anime Expo, and E3 have all decided not to host physical events this year. Comic Con and Anime Expo are July events and often take place after WWDC, while E3 is a June event.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor those who were hoping that things might be back to normal enough to allow for a traditional WWDC event, 2021 will not be the year that happens, and Apple is likely to once again go with the same digital format that it used last year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn many ways, Apple's digital format is more accessible because no one has to pay &#36;1,599 for a ticket or travel to San Jose, California for the event itself, so it's quite possible that the digital format will continue on in some way even when physical gatherings are once again possible in the future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt will probably be some time yet before we hear about Apple's official WWDC plans. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/13/wwdc-online-only-2020/\">last year in March</a> announced that WWDC would be a digital-only event, but it's not clear if we'll get the same early heads up this year. WWDC info last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/05/apple-virtual-wwdc-june-22/\">went out on May 5</a>, so we could see a similar timeline this year.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/digital-wwdc-2021-event-expected/\">Digital WWDC 2021 Event Expected as Comic Con, E3 and Anime Expo Cancel In-Person Plans</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/digital-wwdc-2021-event-expected-as-comic-con-e3-and-anime-expo-cancel-in-person-plans.2286954/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HMWDx5EKrG8:NsTZf1EViXA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HMWDx5EKrG8:NsTZf1EViXA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HMWDx5EKrG8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2c5489ff4a12ee3a4abb1273712e1c2f9457899ccf8dd8f261fc4af0733417d","category":"Apple"}
