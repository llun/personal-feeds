It's expensive, but it's also one of the only Apple-certified &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1622642-REG/rode_wigoii_wireless_go_ii_compact.html\">Rode Wireless Go II</a></strong> (&#36;300) - If you need a high-quality microphone for vlogging or filming videos on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the Rode Wireless Go II is worth checking out. It's a wireless microphone that can record two sound sources simultaneously, and it interfaces with Macs and iOS devices. It has enough internal memory for more than 24 hours of recording, and up to seven hours of battery life.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/usb-flash-drives/sandisk-ixpand-luxe-usb-3-1-type-c\">SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe</a></strong> (&#36;45) - Available in 64, 128, and 256GB capacities, the new SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe has a Lightning connector and a USB-C connector to make it easy to transfer large files between your iOS devices, Macs, and PCs.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.shopmoment.com/shop?search=magsafe\">Moment MagSafe Accessories</a></strong> (&#36;19.99+) - Moment recently came out with a whole range of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; cases and mounts, including the ProTripod mount and the Multi-Threaded mount, both of which are ideal for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; photographers and videographers. The Tripod mount, for example, has a cold shoe mount that works with microphones and other accessories. With the threaded mount, you can attach any accessory to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and Moment is using some seriously strong magnets to make sure your accessories stay attached.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.labodet.com/search?q=magsafe&amp;options%5Bprefix%5D=last\">Labodet MagSafe Wallet</a></strong> (&#36;327) - If you like the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Wallet from Apple but want a seriously higher end version, Labodet has &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; wallet options made from exotic leathers. At this price point, the wallet isn't an accessory for most people, but it does have a stronger magnet than Apple's option.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://grovemade.com/product/magsafe-stand/\">Grovemade MagSafe Stand</a></strong> (&#36;120) - If you have a standard &#36;39 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger from Apple, you might want to look into the Grovemade &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Stand if you're looking for something to hold it up. At &#36;120 it's super expensive, but it is a unique wood design you're not going to get with other charging options. You also need to supply your own &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging puck.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhat are your favorite accessories for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;?
