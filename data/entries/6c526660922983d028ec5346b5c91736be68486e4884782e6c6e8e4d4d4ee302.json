The specific three-pronged design of the cactus in that video doesn't look like anything seen in an official Mario game, but it does match almost precisely the background cacti found in World 2 of <em>Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii</em>, a fan-made mod released in 2013.</p>\n<p>Meatball123 also notes that, as of last weekend, the three-pronged cactus sprite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/meatball_132/status/1358242734528753666\">appeared prominently when a search for \"<em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> cactus\" was performed on Google Images</a>, which could explain how the mixup happened. Representatives for Nintendo and Universal Japan have yet to respond to a request for comment from Ars Technica.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740496#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740496&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c526660922983d028ec5346b5c91736be68486e4884782e6c6e8e4d4d4ee302","category":"Tech"}
