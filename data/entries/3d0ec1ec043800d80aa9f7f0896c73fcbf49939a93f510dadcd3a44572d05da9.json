Shaped like a mask, the single lens sticks out over the nose rather than skirting over it, with the pads on the inside. They're also frameless, but interestingly the top of the lens has been bulked up in an attempt to stiffen the lens in a similar way to a frame.</p>\n<p>Alongside that, there's also an adjustable rake system and a choice of nosepads that allow for a customisable and adjustable fit.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9578/oakley-kato-sunglasses-images#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/888392491657_std_shad_fr.png?itok=3W6OMRvk\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>10</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>The new design does maintain some classic Oakley features, with O Matter stems and Unobtainium earsocks ensuring they're still lightweight, durable and comfortable.</p>\n<p>The huge lens uses the brand's Prizm lens technology, enhancing colour and contrast for optimum visibility – which comes in extra handy with the all-round view the design provides.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9435/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no1-digital-editor-joes-ride-around-kent\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No1: Digital editor Joe's ride around Kent</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9469/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no2-editor-petes-ride-around-north-london-and-hertfordshire\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No2: Editor Pete's ride around North London and Hertfordshire</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9492/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no3-website-editor-jacks-spin-around-south-london-and-surrey\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No3: Website editor Jack's spin around South London and Surrey Hills</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9519/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no4-senior-editor-stus-new-forest-gravel-ride\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No4: Senior editor Stu's New Forest gravel ride</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nCaio Arnato, Oakley global brand director, was in full blown superhero-channeling mode when describing the brand's latest offering: 'Our pursuit for the new and unimagined has taken on many forms throughout the brand's history, and the latest is Oakley Kato – a redefinition of aesthetics to usher in a new age of optics for the sports industry. </p>\n<p>'Today represents more than just the release of a new product, it is a moment to remind ourselves that anything is possible, that superheroes are not just found in comic books, but in real life, and we can all aspire to be better than we ever imagined.'</p>\n<p>The Oakley Kato glasses are available in grey, blue and red (black, sapphire and road) and unsurprisingly come in at the top end of Oakley's range, setting you back a hefty £231. Turns out being better than you ever imagined doesn't come cheap.</p>\n<p>For more information and to buy a pair of Oakley Kato glasses visit <a href=\"https://www.oakley.com/en-gb/kato-sunglasses\" target=\"_blank\">oakley.com</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9578/oakley-kato-sunglasses-images\">Oakley Kato sunglasses images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>6 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9578%2Foakley-kato-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Oakley%20Kato%20sunglasses%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9578%2Foakley-kato-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Oakley%20Kato%20sunglasses%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9578%2Foakley-kato-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Oakley%20Kato%20sunglasses%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9578%2Foakley-kato-sunglasses-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9578/oakley-kato-sunglasses-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/oakley_kato-markcavendish2.jpg?itok=Xk6Qto8c\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/glasses\">Glasses</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3d0ec1ec043800d80aa9f7f0896c73fcbf49939a93f510dadcd3a44572d05da9","category":"Cycling"}
