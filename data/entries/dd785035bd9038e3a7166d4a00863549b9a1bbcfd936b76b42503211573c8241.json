And like all Cube e-bikes, it has a Bosch mid-drive motor and is designed to deliver the best quality possible for the price.</p>\n<p>The easy-to-step-over Trapeze frame design is a reflection of the expansion of e-bike styles inspired by the ever wider variety of people buying them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rutlandcycling.com/bikes/electric-bikes/cube-kathmandu-slt-625-2021-electric-hybrid-trapeze-bike-teak-50cm__486567\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Cube Kathmandu Hybrid SLT 625 Trapeze now from Rutland Cycling</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The Trapeze and step-through (Easy Entry) models are particularly suitable for smaller riders with a choice of frame sizes starting at 46cm, though Cube also offers all Kathmandu Hybrid models in traditional diamond frames as well.</p>\n<p>The Kathmandu Hybrid’s large 625Wh battery should allow most riders to stay out all day, even with a touring load, as long as they keep a careful eye on their power level selection.</p>\n<p>The rear rack is actually welded to the bike frame, making it super-strong and super-reliable. Bosch’s top-of-the-range Performance Line CX motor completes its credentials as a true workhorse of an e-bike, whether you want to tackle any gradient or tow a heavy trailer.</p>\n<p>SLT means the spec is at the top of the Kathmandu Hybrid tree, featuring Bosch’s Nyon touchscreen display with smartphone wireless connectivity, training and navigation features and the ability to create your own power modes, among much else.<a href=\"https://www.rutlandcycling.com/bikes/electric-bikes/cube-kathmandu-slt-625-2021-electric-hybrid-trapeze-bike-teak-50cm__486567\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rutlandcycling.com/bikes/electric-bikes/cube-kathmandu-slt-625-2021-electric-hybrid-trapeze-bike-teak-50cm__486567\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Cube Kathmandu Hybrid SLT 625 Trapeze now from Rutland Cycling</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>To complete the ‘go anywhere, do anything’ package, the bike features air-suspension front forks, a parallelogram suspension seatpost, wide-range derailleur gears, mega-powerful hydraulic disc brakes, a kickstand, mudguards, a chainguard, powerful LED lights and tyres with a huge level of puncture protection.</p>\n<p>You simply could not cram any more top-end capability on to a hybrid-style e-bike.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9510/scottish-cyclist-to-attempt-record-for-furthest-distance-cycled-in-a-week\">Scottish cyclist to attempt record for furthest distance cycled in a week</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9395/goodwood-to-host-duchenne-dash-charity-challenge-in-july\">Goodwood to host Duchenne Dash charity challenge in July</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/rapha/9021/rapha-black-friday-ride-raises-over-130000-for-charity\">Rapha Black Friday Ride raises over £130,000 for charity</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9240/how-to-ride-your-first-century-tips-for-beginners-to-reach-100-miles\">How to ride your first century: Tips for beginners to reach 100 miles</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Cube Kathmandu Hybrid SLT 625 Trapeze specs</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated weight:</td>\n<td>26.6kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame material</td>\n<td>Aluminium Superlite</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Motor</td>\n<td>Performance Line CX Motor – 2021 Upgraded version</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Frame integrated Bosch Powertube 625Wh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated range</td>\n<td>90km (56 miles) in automatic e-MTB mode with a 90kg rider according to the Bosch range estimator </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Groupset</td>\n<td>Shimano XT ShadowPlus 12 derailleur gears</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Natural Fit Sequence+ Comfort also BySchulz G.2 Parallelogram Suspension Seatpost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bars</td>\n<td>Cube Comfort Trail Bar, 700mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>Schwalbe Marathon E-Plus, 55-622</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyres</td>\n<td>CUBE EX23, 36H, disc, tubeless ready </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.cube.eu\" target=\"_blank\">cube.eu</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"dd785035bd9038e3a7166d4a00863549b9a1bbcfd936b76b42503211573c8241","category":"Cycling"}
