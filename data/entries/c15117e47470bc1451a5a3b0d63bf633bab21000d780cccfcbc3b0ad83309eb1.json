Apple has also contracted TSMC to make its next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> processor dubbed A15, built using the foundry's N5 Plus or N5P process node, the sources said.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTSMC is expected to kick off production for Apple's A15 chip that will power the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> series by the end of May, the sources noted.</blockquote>The latest Apple silicon, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, is the first of its kind in the industry based on the 5nm process. The A14 Bionic chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup is also based on the 5nm process. According to the report, Apple is already looking to the 4nm chip process for its next-generation Apple silicon.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA timeframe for when these new 4nm chips will debut isn't provided, but <em>DigiTimes</em> does report that TSMC will move to volume production of the new process in Q4 of 2021, ahead of the previously set 2022 timeframe. Additionally, Apple plans to use an enhanced version of the 5nm process for the A15 chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, with production set to get underway by the end of May.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe smaller process reduces the chips' actual footprint and provides better efficiency and performance. Apple's expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/14-16-macbook-pro-mini-led-display/\">multiple new Macs</a> this year with more powerful Apple silicon chips; however, there's no indication that any will be based on the 4nm process.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/4nm-chips-for-apple-silicon-macs/\">Apple Orders 4nm Chip Production for Next-Generation Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-orders-4nm-chip-production-for-next-generation-macs.2290045/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1u5dBXcsGL8:spHApHc5D1A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1u5dBXcsGL8:spHApHc5D1A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1u5dBXcsGL8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c15117e47470bc1451a5a3b0d63bf633bab21000d780cccfcbc3b0ad83309eb1","category":"Apple"}
