Google Password Manager has long been able to store your passwords thanks to integration into Chrome and Android. It has also been able to generate secure passwords, making it easy to register a new account. Google scans your credentials against a big list of compromised usernames and passwords every time you log in, and if it detects bad credentials, the \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/googles-password-checkup-goes-mainstream-is-built-into-chrome-79/\">Check Password</a>\" screen will pop up. In the past, this screen has left the next steps up to you, but a \"change password\" button from the Google Assistant will now appear on supported sites.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765557#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765557&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6e72393b6b3d2bebeb9c5c77bcb0f97246c04a19adeebd95f57b4b7841782b2","category":"Tech"}
