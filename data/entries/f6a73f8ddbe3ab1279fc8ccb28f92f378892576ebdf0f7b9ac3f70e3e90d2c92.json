As my interest in space grew over the years, and writing about this industry became my profession, I felt a deepening sense of regret for missing that glorious moment of triumph in our shared space history. I lived with that regret for decades—right up until April 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Five years ago today, SpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket first stage on a boat.</p>\n<p>I was not prepared for the experience of watching a skinny, black-and-white rocket fall out of the sky, against the azure backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/04/like-a-boss-falcon-soars-into-space-and-lands-in-the-ocean/\">land on a small drone ship</a>. As whitecaps crashed into the side of the boat, it seemed like a portal opening into the future. This breakthrough in rocket technology washed away any regrets I had about missing Apollo. For, in my mind, landing a Falcon 9 first stage at sea represented an essential step toward reducing the cost of getting people and payloads into space and unlocked a bright spacefaring future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754791#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754791&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6a73f8ddbe3ab1279fc8ccb28f92f378892576ebdf0f7b9ac3f70e3e90d2c92","category":"Tech"}
