{"title":"Sketch: In 2021 and Beyond","link":"https://www.sketch.com/blog/2021/05/11/sketch-in-2021-and-beyond/","date":1621971980000,"content":"\n<p>Sketch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Real-time collaboration works with documents you share in your\nWorkspace, but with the control and privacy features you’d expect\nfrom us; a drafts folder to keep work private until you’re ready\nto share, and a simple promise that we will not store, share or\nsell data about how you work. For example, neither us nor your\nmanager can pull up a report that shows how long you’ve been\nworking. <em>Some products consider tracking like this a feature. We\nconsider its absence a feature.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is clearly a shot against Figma, a purely web-based rival app to Sketch, and an interesting angle to take. Figma allows for some truly invasive tracking of what your team members are doing — without them knowing that you (as a manager) are effectively standing over their shoulders watching them work (or not work). But I suspect such tracking — when used to micromanage — is really only a thing at big companies, and the people who agree with Sketch that the absence of tracking capabilities is a feature are not the people who choose the company’s design tools.</p>\n\n<p>Figma has really taken off, with a lot of market and mind share, because their collaboration features truly are useful and cool. (It’s just a good design app in general, even if you’re not collaborating with anyone.) I know several designers who, in general, would prefer to use a native Mac app like Sketch but who really do love Figma because it’s a great tool. It’s great to see Sketch launch their own collaboration features. Sketch-vs.-Figma (vs. Adobe XD) is a rivalry that is good for everyone. Reminds me a bit of Illustrator-vs.-Freehand and QuarkXPress-vs.-Pagemaker from the early days of desktop publishing.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/25/sketch-in-2021\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b6c96ea99f27e399a2a4b2296c04254cd8a7c3acda7e5598358a3e7fe95f194c","category":"Tech"}
