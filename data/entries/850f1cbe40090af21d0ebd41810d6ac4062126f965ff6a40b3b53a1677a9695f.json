It can be an outlet from all the distractions of what is thrown at us. It helps us to escape. I don&#8217;t need to go on; you&#8217;ve all had that song, that album that means something to you, that talks to you. It&#8217;s a given.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-1340x950.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-489643\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-1340x950.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-650x461.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-190x135.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-400x284.jpg 400w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-1080x765.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00030144-015.jpg 1411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Looks like Lukas is a man that will be slightly upset come April 1st.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So for this series, I&#8217;m going to hunt out the audiophiles of the peloton. I&#8217;m going to track down the DJs of the team bus, the guys that irritate the rest of the team with their wild choices of warm-up, pump up tracks. And along the way, I&#8217;ll get them to build up a personal playlist. Which, of course, I&#8217;ll post here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this first episode, I hit gold: Lukas Pöstlberger of Bora-Hansgrohe. He&#8217;s a Giro d&#8217;Italia pink jersey wearer, multiple Austrian national champ and an all-round staple of the peloton. He&#8217;s also a man that, from hunting through our archived photos, will definitely miss the aero tuck once it&#8217;s banished come April 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What people outside the team won&#8217;t be aware of is that he&#8217;s heavily into his music, so much so he attended a high school dedicated to music. Lukas turned out to be the perfect pro to kick this series off. Admittedly he may have strayed a fair way from his classical education.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109-1340x893.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-489640\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109-1340x893.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109-650x433.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00027965-109.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Pink jersy, good music choices, this man has it all.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To hear Lukas talk through his playlist, check out the video above. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Lukas&#8217; PainCave playlist</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2kkYhFv3DyzDtPRK8vHQWc\">https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2kkYhFv3DyzDtPRK8vHQWc</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Songs list:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Makeba- Jain<br>Roller &#8211; Apache 207<br>Omen &#8211; Prodigy<br>Ich geh heut nicht mehr tanzen &#8211; Annenmaykantereit<br>Peanut butter jelly &#8211; Galantis<br>Sail &#8211; Awolnation<br>Sound of Silence &#8211; Disturbed<br>Blood Sugar &#8211; Pendulum<br>When the music stops &#8211; Eminem</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/pro-cyclist-playlist-with-lukas-postlberger-the-man-we-dont-let-near-the-stereo/\">Pro Cyclist Playlist with Lukas Pöstlberger: The man we don&#8217;t let near the stereo</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"850f1cbe40090af21d0ebd41810d6ac4062126f965ff6a40b3b53a1677a9695f","category":"Cycling"}
