In the Browse tab, which normally shows new and trending songs and playlists, Apple has posted a simple teaser telling subscribers to “Get ready—Music is about to change forever.” The Apple Music app teaser is accompanied by a video of a spinning Apple Music logo but curiously doesn’t include any audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-music-teaser.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A series of rumors on Friday pointed to a Tuesday release for the new Apple Music+ service, which will reportedly arrive alongside 3rd-generation AirPods. The service will presumably allow users to stream at a bitrate higher than the current 256Kbps. Apple wouldn’t be the first to offer high-fidelity streaming. Tidal and other services already offer lossless streaming at a higher price, while Spotify has announced a new HiFi tier at a higher price. Apple Music+ will reportedly cost the same $10/month as the current plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>App designer Stijn de Vries spotted a air of Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless logos in the code for the Apple Music website:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Hmm look at what I found in the Apple Music website…. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/Lb4HbQ6Nww&amp;xcust=1-1-346705-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/Lb4HbQ6Nww</a></p>— Stijn de Vries (@StijnDV) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/StijnDV/status/1394204349082001408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-346705-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>The launch of Apple Music+ would be a surprise during the same week that the new 24-inch iMac and iPad Pro are beginning to ship.
