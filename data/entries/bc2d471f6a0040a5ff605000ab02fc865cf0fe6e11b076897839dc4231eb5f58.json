And in 2021 we’ve seen an outstanding display of machines across the road and gravel genres.</p>\n<p>It’s a nice problem to have, admittedly, but compiling this shortlist and picking an overall winner has never been so hard.</p>\n<h3>Unrivalled access</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Our top four bikes were tested head-to-head before picking an overall winner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2021 edition has, unsurprisingly, been far from normal with the backdrop of a global pandemic, unprecedented shortages, and pricing pressures from a mix of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/pandemic-brexit-bike-prices/\">global factors and political decisions</a>.</p>\n<p>We’re lucky that our unrivalled industry contacts and the historic legacy of Bike of the Year has ensured that we’ve had a steady influx of bikes reaching our south-west testing grounds at a time when bikes are in short supply (or stuck in the Suez Canal).</p>\n<p>Although I’ll admit that I’ve missed the group-riding ventures, cake stops and post-ride chats over a cold drink (and, yes, continental sunshine and roads) that often provide the greatest memories of previous Bike of the Year tests, restrictions were beginning to ease as testing came to a close, ensuring that we were able to ride our final four bikes together.</p>\n<h3>What we’ve tested</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It was great to finally be able to get out and test in a small group.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The prices of this year’s bikes range from £1,775 to £11,750, with categories for endurance, performance, gravel and superbike. We’ll be announcing winners for each category in the coming days, alongside the Boardman as our overall winner.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we’re also running a £1,000 Bike of the Year test to show you don’t have to spend superbike money to get a great ride. If you’re wondering about aero bikes, this year’s shortages mean we’re running a four-bike aero shoot-out as a separate test, with contenders from Cannnodale, Felt, Merida and Scott.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to Bike of the Year. Some of the bikes in this year’s main test are already bonafide classics or refined versions of previous winners, with the latest BMC Teammachine, Specialized Tarmac and Roubaix, and Cannondale SuperSix all present.</p>\n<p>Innovation is also here in spades, notably in the striking Cannondale Topstone and the Rondo HVRT, but also in the app-based tech of the Boardman SLR 9.4 AXS.</p>\n<p>Gravel has captured the imagination of riders and the industry alike and that’s reflected in this year’s Bike of the Year, with do-it-all machines from Boardman, Cannondale, Cinelli and Pearson especially hungry for multi-terrain adventures in 2021.</p>\n<p>You should find something to inspire your next bike purchase, whether that’s one of the exact models we’ve tested or lower-priced models with trickle-down tech from the classy contenders on display.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy Bike of the Year 2021 as much as I’ve relished creating it.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Bike of the Year 2020 | The contenders</h2>\n<h3><span>Performance </span></h3>\n<ul><li>Basso Venta 105 Disc</li>\n<li>BMC Teammachine SLR Two </li>\n<li>Cannondale SuperSix Evo Carbon Disc Ultegra</li>\n<li>Giant TCR Advanced Pro 1</li>\n<li>Lapierre Xelius SL 5.0 Disc</li>\n<li>Orbea Orca M20</li>\n<li>Rondo HVRT CF1</li>\n</ul><h3><span>Endurance </span></h3>\n<ul><li>BMC Roadmachine Two</li>\n<li>Boardman SLR 9.4 AXS Disc Carbon</li>\n<li>Cervélo Caledonia-5 Ultegra Di2</li>\n<li>Ribble Endurance Ti Disc</li>\n<li>Sensa Guilia GF Ultegra Di2</li>\n<li>Specialized Roubaix Sport</li>\n<li>Trek Domane AL5</li>\n</ul><h3><span>Gravel </span></h3>\n<ul><li>Boardman ADV 9.0</li>\n<li>Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty 1</li>\n<li>Cinelli King Zydeco GRX</li>\n<li>Pearson Off Grid</li>\n<li>Ribble CGR Ti Pro </li>\n</ul><h3><span>Superbikes </span></h3>\n<ul><li>ARC8 Escapee DB</li>\n<li>Giant TCR Advanced SL 0 Disc</li>\n<li>Specialized S-Works Aethos Dura-Ace Di2</li>\n<li>Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL7 Red eTap</li>\n</ul><h3><span>£1,000</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Boardman ADV 8.9</li>\n<li>Boardman SLR 8.9 105</li>\n<li>Genesis CDA 30</li>\n<li>Giant Contend AR 3</li>\n<li>Orbea Avant H60-D</li>\n<li>Planet X London Road SRAM Apex 1 Disc</li>\n<li>Ribble Endurance 725 Base</li>\n<li>Van Rysel EDR AF</li>\n<li>Vitus Zenium Tiagra</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><section><div>\n        \n<h2><span>Thanks to…</span></h2>\n<p>A massive thank-you to <a href=\"https://www.q36-5.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Q36.5</a> for sorting the kit for the photo and video shoots, <a href=\"https://www.lazersport.com/uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Lazer</a> for keeping our heads protected, and <a href=\"https://www.100percent.com/\" target=\"_blank\">100%</a> for shielding our eyes from the elements on the roads and trails.</p>\n<p>And not forgetting <a href=\"https://muc-off.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Muc-Off</a>, for its help keeping the bikes washed and lubed throughout testing.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"George Scott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"bc2d471f6a0040a5ff605000ab02fc865cf0fe6e11b076897839dc4231eb5f58","category":"Cycling"}
