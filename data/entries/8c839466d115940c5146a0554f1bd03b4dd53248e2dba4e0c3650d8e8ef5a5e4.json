In 2019, there were estimated to be 1.7 billion, almost one website for every three people on the planet. Not only has the number of websites exploded, the weight of each page has also skyrocketed. Between 2003 and 2019, the average webpage weight grew from about 100&nbsp;KB to about 4&nbsp;MB. The results?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“In our analysis of 5.2 million pages,” Brian Dean reported for Backlinko in October 2019, “the average time it takes to fully load a webpage is 10.3 seconds on desktop and 27.3 seconds on mobile.” In 2013, Radware calculated that the average load time for a webpage on mobile was 4.3 seconds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Study after study shows that people absolutely hate slow webpages. In 2018, Google research found that 53% of mobile site visitors left a page that took longer than three seconds to load. A 2015 study by Radware found that “a site that loads in 3 seconds experiences 22% fewer page views, a 50% higher bounce rate, and a 22% fewer conversions than a site that loads in 1 second, while a site that loads in 5 seconds experiences 35% fewer page views, a 105% higher bounce rate, and 38% fewer conversions.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The causes of webpage bloat? Images and videos are mainly to blame. By 2022, it’s estimated that online videos will make up more than 82% of all consumer Internet traffic—15 times more than in 2017. However, from the code to the content, everything about Web design has become super-bloated and super-polluting. Consider that if a typical webpage that weighs 4&nbsp;MB is downloaded 600,000 times, one tree will need to be planted in order to deal with the resulting pollution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They say a picture paints a thousand words. Well, 1,000 words of text takes up roughly two A4 (210 mm wide and 297 mm long) pages and weighs about 6&nbsp;KB. You’d place about four images that are 9 cm x 16 cm on two A4 pages. Let’s say these images are well optimized and weigh 40&nbsp;KB each. (A poorly optimized image could weigh several megabytes.) Even with such high optimization, two A4 pages of images will weigh around 160&nbsp;KB. That’s 27 times more than the two A4 pages of text. A 30-second video, on the other hand, could easily weigh 3&nbsp;MB. Videos create massively more pollution than text. Text is the ultimate compression technique. It is by far the most environmentally friendly way to communicate. If you want to save the planet, use more text. Think about digital weight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From an energy point of view, it’s not simply about page weight. Some pages may have very heavy processing demands once they are downloaded. Other pages, particularly those that are ad-driven, will download with lots of third-party websites hanging off them, either feeding them content, or else demanding to be fed data, often personal data on the site’s visitor. It’s like a type of Trojan Horse. You think you’re accessing one website or app, but then all these other third parties start accessing you. According to Trent Walton, the top 50 most visited websites had an average of 22 third-party websites hanging off them. The New York Times had 64, while Washington Post had 63. All these third-party websites create pollution and invade privacy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a tremendous amount of out-of-date content on websites. I have worked with hundreds of websites where we had to delete up to 90% of the pages in order to start seeing improvements. Poorly written, out-of-date code is also a major problem. By cleaning up its JavaScript code, Wikipedia estimated that they saved 4.3 terabytes a day of data bandwidth for their visitors. By saving those terabytes, we saved having to plant almost 700 trees to deal with the yearly pollution that would have been caused.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to help save the planet, reduce digital weight. Clean up your website. Before you add an image, make sure that it does something useful and it’s the most optimized image possible. Every time you add code, make sure it does something useful and it’s the leanest code possible. Always be on the lookout for waste images, waste code, waste content. Get into the habit of removing something every time you add something.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Publishing is an addiction. Giving a website to an organization is like giving a pub to an alcoholic. You remember the saying, “There’s a book inside everyone”? Well, the Web let the book out. It’s happy days for a while as we all publish, publish, publish. Then…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Hi, I’m Gerry. I have a 5,000-page website.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Hi, Gerry.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“I used to have a 500-page website, but I had no self-control. It was one more page, one more page… What harm could one more page do?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Redesign is rehab for websites. Every two to three years some manager either gets bored with the design or some other manager meets a customer who tells them about how horrible it is to find anything on the website. The design team rounds up a new bunch of fake images and fake content for the top-level pages, while carefully avoiding going near the heaving mess at the lower levels. After the launch, everyone is happy for a while (except the customers, of course) because in many organizations what is important is to be seen to be doing things and producing and launching things, rather than to do something useful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you must do something, do something useful. That often means not doing, removing, minimizing, cleaning up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beware the tiny tasks. We’ve used the Top Tasks method to identify what matters and what doesn’t matter to people, whether they’re buying a car, choosing a university, looking after their health, buying some sort of technology product, or whatever. In any environment we’ve carried it out in—and we’ve done it more than 500 times—there are no more than 100 things that could potentially matter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a health environment, these might include symptoms, treatment, prevention, costs, waiting times, etc. When buying a car they might include price, engine type, warranties, service costs, etc. We’ve carried out Top Tasks surveys in some 40 countries and 30 languages, with upwards of 400,000 people voting. In every single survey the same patterns emerge. Let’s say there are 100 potential tasks. People are asked to vote on the tasks that are most important to them. When the results come in, we will find that five of the tasks will get the first 25% of the vote. 50 tasks will get the final 25% of the vote. The top five tasks get as much of the vote as the bottom 50. It’s the same pattern in Norway, New Zealand, Israel, USA, Canada, UK, Brazil, wherever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bottom 50 are what I call the tiny tasks. When a tiny task goes to sleep at night it dreams of being a top task. These tiny tasks—the true waste generators—are highly ambitious and enthusiastic. They will do everything they can to draw attention to themselves, and one of the best ways of doing that is to produce lots of content, design, code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once we get the Top Tasks results, we sometimes analyze how much organizational effort is going into each task. Invariably, there is an inverse relationship between the importance of the task to the customer and the effort that the organization is making in relation to these tasks. The more important it is to the customer, the less is being done; the less important it is to the customer, the more is being done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beware of focusing too much energy, time and resources on the tiny tasks. Reducing the tiny tasks is the number one way you can reduce the number of pages and features. Save the planet. Delete the tiny tasks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>A plague of useless images</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was giving a talk at an international government digital conference once, and I asked people to send me examples of where digital government was working well. One suggestion was for a website in a language I don’t speak. When I visited it, I saw one of those typical big images that you see on so many websites. I thought to myself: I’m going to try and understand this website based on its images.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The big image was of a well-dressed, middle-aged woman walking down the street while talking on her phone. I put on my Sherlock Holmes hat. Hmm… Something to do with telecommunications, perhaps? Why would they choose a woman instead of a man, or a group of women and men? She’s married, I deduced by looking at the ring on her finger. What is that telling me? And what about her age? Why isn’t she younger or older? And why is she alone? Questions, questions, but I’m no Sherlock Holmes. I couldn’t figure out anything useful from this image.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I scrolled down the page. Ah, three more images. The first one is a cartoon-like image of a family on vacation. Hmm… The next one is of two men and one woman in a room. One of them has reached their hand out and placed it on something, but I can’t see what that something is, because the other two have placed their hands on top of that hand. It’s a type of pledge or something, a secret society, perhaps? Two of them are smiling and the third is trying to smile. What could that mean? And then the final picture is of a middle-aged man staring into the camera, neither smiling nor unsmiling, with a somewhat kind, thoughtful look. What is happening?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I must admit that after examining all the visual evidence I had absolutely no clue what this government website was about. So, I translated it. It was about the employment conditions and legal status of government employees. Now, why didn’t I deduce that from the images?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Web is smothering us in useless images that create lots of pollution. These clichéd, stock images communicate absolutely nothing of value, interest or use. They are one of the worst forms of digital pollution and waste, as they cause page bloat, making it slower for pages to download, while pumping out wholly unnecessary pollution. They take up space on the page, forcing more useful content out of sight, making people scroll for no good reason.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interpublic is a very large global advertising agency. As with all advertising agencies they stress how “creative” they are, which means they love huge, meaningless, happy-clappy polluting images. When I tested their homepage, it emitted almost 8 grams of CO2 as it downloaded, putting Interpublic in the worst 10% of website polluters, according to the Website Carbon Calculator. (For comparison, the Google homepage emits 0.23 grams.) One single image on its homepage weighed 3.2&nbsp;MB. This image could easily have been 10 times smaller, while losing nothing in visual appeal. The Interpublic website is like a filthy, rusty 25-year-old diesel truck, belching fumes as it trundles down the Web.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of optimizing images so that they’ll download faster, the opposite is often happening. High-resolution images are a major cost to the environment. If, for example, you move from a 4K resolution image to an 8K one, the file size doesn’t double, it trebles. For example, I saved an image at 4K and it was 6.9&nbsp;MB. At 8K it was 18&nbsp;MB.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Digital “progress” and “innovation” often means an increasing stress on the environment. Everything is more. Everything is higher. Everything is faster. And everything is exponentially more demanding of the environment. Digital is greedy for energy and the more it grows the greedier it gets. We need digital innovation that reduces environmental stress, that reduces the digital footprint. We need digital designers who think about the weight of every design decision they make.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We must start by trying to use the option that damages the environment least, and that is text. Don’t assume that images are automatically more powerful than text. Sometimes, text does the job better.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>In a test with an insurance company, it was found that a promotion for a retirement product was deemed less accurate when an image of a face was used than when text only was used.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>An initiative by the UK government to get people to sign up to become potential organ donors tested eight approaches. The approaches that used images were least effective. Text-only worked best.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Hello?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Hello. Is that the Department of Useless Images?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“We have this contact form and we need a useless image for it.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“How about a family cavorting in a field of spring flowers with butterflies dancing in the background?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Perfect.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are indeed many situations where images are genuinely useful, particularly when it comes to helping people better understand how a product works or looks. Airbnb, for example, found that its growth only began to accelerate after it invested in getting quality images of the rental properties on offer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you need to use images, optimize them and consider using real ones of real people doing real things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They say a picture paints a thousand words but sometimes it’s a thousand words of crap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->","author":"","siteTitle":"A List Apart: The Full Feed","siteHash":"09b09f389b84b264a6ebab120b6208479961d3fe7df4850a75b103b2b9c8a950","entryHash":"8c839466d115940c5146a0554f1bd03b4dd53248e2dba4e0c3650d8e8ef5a5e4","category":"Tech"}
