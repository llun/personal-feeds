The update also includes the ability to convert LUTs into color adjustments. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn version 2.0.8, color adjustments can also be exported as LUTs, to be used in Final Cut Pro and other compatible graphics, video, and even 3D apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, there's a built-in collection of LUTs, ranging from cinematic looks to grayscale conversion LUTs, automation and scripting support for applying and exporting LUTs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPixelmator 2.0 is a Universal app, so it runs natively on both ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>‌ and Intel-based Macs. The image editing app update is free for existing Pixelmator Pro users, otherwise it costs $39.99 and can be downloaded directly from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905\">Mac App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pixelmator/\">Pixelmator</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/pixelmator-pro-update-adds-lut-support/\">Pixelmator Pro Update Adds LUT Support for Color Adjustments</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pixelmator-pro-update-adds-lut-support-for-color-adjustments.2293869/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FSZfoINMcnE:IMFIKNNX-eg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FSZfoINMcnE:IMFIKNNX-eg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FSZfoINMcnE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fff59c3b69edb02926be79d24aad9cf75d993dc59598c0c8c31a465a10f0ba19","category":"Apple"}
