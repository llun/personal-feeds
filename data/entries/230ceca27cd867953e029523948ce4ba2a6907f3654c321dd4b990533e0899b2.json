Open to anyone on two or three wheels, and willing to spend 12 hours outdoors in one go.</p>\n<p>The idea is simple. Albion wants to promote going outdoors and wants to enables you to stay out longer. 12 hours outside is longer for most. So get ready for a new 12 hour adventure happening for you somewhere this May. Plot a route on komoot and stay outside for 12 hours. It doesn’t even have to be riding time. You could stay in the saddle for 12 hours straight, or for just a few hours before finding a place to sleep and pedalling back home in the morning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/388065-DSCF0305-34-366821-original-1618929332.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar with komoot, it offers the chance to showcase your photography, mapping prowess and words to build a story around your ride.
