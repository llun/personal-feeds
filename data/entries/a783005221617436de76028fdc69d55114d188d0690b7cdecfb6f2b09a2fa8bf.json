It’s one of the few essential iPhone chips that Apple doesn’t manufacture, and a new report says that isn’t going to change with the next few models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been working on a 5G modem since last year following its purchase of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3411877/apple-confirms-that-it-will-acquire-most-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business.html\">Intel’s shuttered mobile modem business</a>. The billion-dollar deal brought patents, intellectual property, and a couple of thousand employees as Apple looks to cut ties with Qualcomm, which currently supplies the X55 modem in the iPhone 12. However, TFT Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/kuo-apple-designed-5g-modem/&amp;xcust=1-2-345908-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via MacRumors</a>) that Apple isn’t close to making its own mobile modem:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><blockquote><p><em>We predict that the ‌iPhone‌ will adopt Apple’s own design 5G baseband chips in 2023 at the earliest. As Android sales in the high-end 5G phone market are sluggish, Qualcomm will be forced to compete for more orders in the low-end market to compensate for Apple’s order loss.</em></p><cite>Ming-Chi Kuo</cite></blockquote></figure><p>Qualcomm stands to lose a lot more than Intel by losing Apple as a customer. While Apple’s decision to make its own M1 processor for the Mac clearly stung, the iPhone is a much bigger fish and likely accounts for a much larger percentage of Qualcomm’s bottom line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has made no secret of its intention to cut off Qualcomm as a supplier, but it’s the only company that can supply chips at the scale Apple needs. Apple was engaged in a lawsuit with the company over its royalty rate before agreeing to a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3389817/apple-qualcomm-settle-legal-case.html\">multi-year licensing agreement in 2019</a> when it became clear that Intel wouldn’t be able to deliver 5G modems as promised for the iPhone 12.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a783005221617436de76028fdc69d55114d188d0690b7cdecfb6f2b09a2fa8bf","category":"Apple"}
