This change was made alongside the refresh seen to the 27-inch models in August 2020.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMoving to the larger models, both retailers have the 27-inch Retina iMac from mid 2020 (3.1GHz 6-Core, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F8ZPRGW?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"><strong>&#36;1,649.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,799.00.

This one is only available at Amazon, and it's a match of the best price we've ever seen, thanks to a <strong>&#36;59.01 coupon that will be applied at the checkout screen</strong>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F8HK6KF?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;200 OFF</div>27-Inch iMac for &#36;1,799.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, Amazon has the 2020 27-inch Retina iMac (3.8GHz 8-Core, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F8PWMD1?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"><strong>&#36;2,148.92</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,299.00.
