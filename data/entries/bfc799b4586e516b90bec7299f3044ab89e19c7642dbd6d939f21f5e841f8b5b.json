As we all grapple with the realization 12 months have passed, various anniversaries are being marked. There are <em>lots</em> of major mileposts to mark; moments that made the severity and global scale of the pandemic clear, or were the first signs of the new reality of social isolation, remote schooling, and offices created out of any available spare space.</p>\n<p>For many of us at Ars, the big mileposts were abstract—things that happened to other people or society as a whole as we continued to work from home. But as we talked about the experience of last March, each of us seemed to come up with a different moment when the severity of the pandemic really clicked.</p>\n<p>What follows is a collection of the experiences that drove home the severity of COVID-19 to each of us—the moments we knew things weren't going to be the same.
