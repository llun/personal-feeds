The scheme allows you to claim a £50 voucher to use towards the cost of repairing a bicycle in England.</p>\n<p>The Fix Your Bike initiative was <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/active-travel-funding-new-era/\">originally announced in May 2020</a>. The first 50,000 vouchers were subsequently released in July, but many applicants complained the website crashed amid high demand. The vouchers were no longer available within ten hours of release. This is the fourth batch of vouchers to be released.</p>\n<p>Only one voucher can be claimed per household (down from two per household for the initial release) and can only be used with a bike shop or mechanic registered with the scheme in England.</p>\n<p>“As there are a limited number of vouchers available, please consider the needs of others before applying for a voucher and do not delay making planned repairs outside of the scheme should your circumstances allow it,” reads <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fix-your-bike-voucher-scheme-apply-for-a-voucher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Department for Transport website</a>.</p>\n<p>Bike shops have been allowed to stay open through <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/covid-19-cycling/\">the nation’s third national lockdown</a>. We’d recommend calling your local bike shop in advance of visiting to ensure the business is open and to check what social distancing measures are in place.</p>\n<section class=\"highlight \">\n    <div class=\"highlight__content editor-content\">\n        <h2>How to claim a Fix Your Bike voucher</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Apply for a voucher of up to £50 on the <a href=\"https://fixyourbikevoucherscheme.est.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fix Your Bike website</a></li>\n<li>Find a mechanic registered with the scheme using <a href=\"https://fixyourbikevoucherscheme.est.org.uk/Home/Map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this map</a></li>\n<li>Book a service and take your bike to your chosen mechanic to be fixed, using the voucher to cover up to £50 of the total cost</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n\n    </div>\n    </section>\n\n</p><p>The launch of the scheme came after the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cycling-prescriptions/\">government announced its Better Health strategy</a> in the midst of the pandemic last year.</p>\n<p>“The Fix Your Bike Voucher Scheme has been set up to encourage more people to embrace cycling as a means of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,” according to the Department for Transport. “Cycling is an excellent way to travel while maintaining social distancing.”</p>\n<p>The scheme aims to increase the number of short journeys taken by bike rather than private car, with benefits for the climate, public health and wellbeing, road congestion and air quality.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/cycling-environmental-impact/\">How green is cycling?
