One is that Apple's smallest &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; model was launched to target the U.S. and European markets, but the global health crisis has impacted sales in these territories, leading to a slowdown in ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;‌ orders.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe theory goes that with people staying at home a lot more during lockdown, smartphone users are consuming more content on their device and therefore want bigger screens to enjoy it. A consequence is that users don't have as much opportunity to appreciate the convenience of having a smaller phone in their pocket while out and about.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, though China has not been as severely impacted by the health crisis in recent months compared to these parts of the world, the East Asian market has historically favored larger form factor devices, which has put &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; at a disadvantage in those regions from the get-go.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAnother possible factor is the continuing availability of lower-cost models like the &#36;399 ‌&zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;‌, &#36;499 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/\">iPhone XR</a>, and &#36;599 ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a>‌, which may have ultimately limited the appeal of the more expensive ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;‌, which is priced at &#36;699.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite these variables – along with a recent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/iphone-12-mini-low-january-sales/\">claim</a> by JPMorgan Chase that Apple plans to discontinue &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; production in the second quarter of 2021 – it is understood that Apple has not given up on the 5.4-inch model yet, and is broadly expected to include the form factor in its &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup, likely to be launched in the fall.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis belief is reflected in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-13-lineup-rumored-120hz-iphone-se-3-2022/\">earliest reports</a> of the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; series, all of which underlined that Apple would follow the same four-model lineup as the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; in the same three sizes. Indeed, Apple will have had its &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; production and supply chain operation planned out well in advance, and if the above reasons for poor &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; sales are on the mark, Apple may well be expecting an upturn in demand for the smaller size in its target markets, as vaccination programs roll out and lockdowns ease over the course of the year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs recently as this past weekend, hit-and-miss Apple leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yrf5brao0o\">claimed</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini will indeed materialize later this year, with the accompanying claim that there will be no new \"2021\" &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, of which the current model may have cannibalized some &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; sales.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll in all, despite the early doom and gloom, \"mini\" fans still have reason to be cheerful as we move through the year and approach the next launch of a new series of Apple smartphones.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-mini-expected-despite-12-sales/\">iPhone 13 Mini Still Expected Despite Lackluster iPhone 12 Mini Sales</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-mini-still-expected-despite-lackluster-iphone-12-mini-sales.2284762/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0qUElgFpdOM:icVlukJFKEQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0qUElgFpdOM:icVlukJFKEQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0qUElgFpdOM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23b33fe3939c2e7d651c13c2fbe77315bd201645c357810295b4788a0535e570","category":"Apple"}
