{"title":"Lawsuit Accusing Apple of Recording of Confidential Siri Requests Without User Consent Dismissed","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-siri-recording-lawsuit-dismissed/","date":1613000208000,"content":"A Northern California judge today dismissed a class action lawsuit that accused Apple of the \"unlawful and intentional\" recording of confidential <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> communications without user consent.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/10/hey-siri.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-597347\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe class action lawsuit was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/07/apple-lawsuit-siri-recordings/\">first filed in August 2019</a> after it became known that Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/26/siri-human-analysis-voice-recordings/\">employed contractors</a> to listen to and grade some anonymized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; conversations for product improvement purposes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThose contractors told <em>The Guardian</em> that they overheard confidential medical details, drug deals, and other private information from accidental &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; activations, and some expressed concern that users were not adequately informed about the recordings.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-10/apple-judge-tosses-out-suit-claiming-siri-serial-eavesdropping\">Bloomberg</a></em>, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said that the plaintiffs in the class action case did not provide enough detail about the alleged recordings that Apple collected. The plaintiffs are required to prove that they have suffered injury from Apple's actions in a \"concrete and particularized\" way that's not \"conjectural or hypothetical.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll of the allegations in the lawsuit were based on information that was included in the original story from <em>The Guardian</em> highlighting Apple's use of contractors to analyze &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; data, with the plaintiffs providing no proof that their own private data was accidentally collected by Apple and misused.<blockquote>The Guardian article does not plausibly suggest that all Apple's devices were subject to accidental triggers and review by third party contractors, much less that such interception always occurred in reasonably private settings. The article discusses frequency of accidental triggers primarily in relation to the Apple Watch and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> speakers, neither of which are owned by the Plaintiffs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMoreover, the article expressly states that only a \"small portion\" of daily &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; activations including were sent to contractors and that they included both deliberate and accidental activations. Finally, although the article describes private communications among the recordings sent to contractors, Plaintiffs allege no facts to suggest that their own private communications were intercepted by accidental triggers.</blockquote>Though Apple's motion to dismiss the lawsuit was granted, the judge in the case is allowing the consumers involved in the lawsuit to revise and refile within 20 days, so Apple is not in the clear as of yet.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFollowing the class action lawsuit and other negative public feedback, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/02/apple-suspending-siri-grading-program/\">temporarily suspended</a> and overhauled its &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; evaluation program, and in iOS 13.2, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/10/siri-privacy-options-ios-13-2/\">added an option</a> to let users delete &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; history <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/delete-siri-audio-history-opt-out-audio-sharing/\">and opt out</a> of sharing audio recordings.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-siri-recording-lawsuit-dismissed/\">Lawsuit Accusing Apple of Recording of Confidential Siri Requests Without User Consent Dismissed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lawsuit-accusing-apple-of-recording-of-confidential-siri-requests-without-user-consent-dismissed.2284203/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wxw6leCUZPg:w9-X5Ehf5Zw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wxw6leCUZPg:w9-X5Ehf5Zw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wxw6leCUZPg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"723657a19ee9c679849684558b204de43ae0987a20af83fd2b36e2dfd2660aa9","category":"Apple"}
