Kuo says Apple won’t be ignoring it like the previous iPhone SE. While the design reportedly won’t be changing, Kuo says the SE will be getting <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/punch-hole-iphone-5g-se/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an updated processor and 5G connectivity</a> next year.</p><p>Switching to the regular iPhone, Kuo surmises that the Pro model might be losing the notch in favor of a hole-punch camera that’s popular on Android phones, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/punch-hole-iphone-5g-se/\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to 9to5Mac</a>.

It would be surprising to see Apple ditch it in favor of Touch ID like on the iPad Air—in fact, Kuo specifically says Touch ID isn’t planned—but we’d definitely like to see the notch go away.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3609898/the-future-of-the-iphone-a-folding-screen-5g-se-and-notch-less-pro-may-be-on-the-way.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4a25854a4082372d69eaa165404a2012976667dcfa2d870fa11e805c3a24b264","category":"Apple"}
