The 37-year-old American will close out his third season with BikeExchange before hanging up the proverbial wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookwalter, who turned pro with BMC back in 2008, spent 11 years with the American squad before joining the Mitchelton-Scott organization (now BikeExchange) at the start of 2019. Along the way, he has frequently contended for one-week results, particularly in North American events, while riding in support of others in the Grand Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bookwalter counts stage wins at Tour of Qatar, USA Pro Challenge, and Tour of Utah on his career palmares, and he has made 11 Grand Tour starts over the course of his career. He also finished on the GC podiums of the Tour of Qatar, the Tour of Utah, the USA Pro Challenge, and the Tour of California, and rode to seventh at Strade Bianche in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve been honored to work alongside some of the most talented and dedicated athletes, staff, and management. It is difficult to leave a sport that I still truly love, and I am so grateful for the amazing opportunities that have been presented to me throughout the years,” Bookwalter said in a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I feel so fortunate to have had the career I’ve had—from racing most of it at the same team who actually took a pretty big risk on me in the beginning all the way to helping Cadel win the Tour de France. Additionally, it was a tremendous privilege to represent the United States as an Olympian and that will be something I cherish forever.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/brent-bookwalter-will-retire-at-the-end-of-the-year/\">Brent Bookwalter will retire at the end of the year</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2a6230992ae64b4306dec1079c476295c4531409519b4936cfc48d125849cf7d","category":"Cycling"}
