We talk about some developments involving Apple’s next iPhone, as well as the end of the iPhone 12 mini, and more in this episode of the Macworld Podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is episode 748 with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/jason-cross\">Jason Cross</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/roman-loyola\">Roman Loyola</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/michael-simon\">Michael Simon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get info</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On this episode, we talk about a few news items that popped up, a mix of iPhone stories. We start with a recent poll taken by SellCell, and according to them, one in five respondents are put off by the upcoming new iPhone, specifically the possibility that it will be called the iPhone 13. Apparently, those users have a fear of the number 13.

They’re offering signing bonuses of over $1,200 (U.S.) to people who once worked for Foxconn, left, and are coming back. New employees are getting signing bonuses that are a little less than that.

Isn’t there a chip shortage? There is, but it pays to be Apple—and it pays to work with Apple, too. DigiTime Asia reports that the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is giving orders from Apple top priority.

TrendForce reports that the iPhone 12 mini has reached end-of-life status and will no longer be made. Apple will sell its remaining inventory, and then that’s it, no more iPhone 12 mini.
