Verizon has pushed back the sunsetting of its 3G network several times now, but it sounds like a concrete end date has finally been established.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/09/verizonlogo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"206\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-466577\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>We will turn off the last of the 3G CDMA network on December 31, 2022, months after our competitors have shut off their networks completely. The date will not be extended again. We're communicating this again now in order to provide customers plenty of time to complete their migration.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\nVerizon first announced plans to shut down its 3G network in 2016, and at that time, said that 3G would cease working on December 31, 2019. Verizon ultimately delayed until the end of 2020 to give impacted customers more time to figure out their plans, and then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/verizon-delays-3g-network-shutdown/\">in January 2021</a>, said that the network would not be shut down in the near future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThough Verizon has kept 3G up and running, it stopped activating 3G phones in July 2018. Verizon says that it has been working with customers who still have 3G devices to transfer them over to 4G and 5G phones, and less than one percent now use the 3G network.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nVerizon is encouraging customers with a 3G device to transition to a 4G device now, and as the cutoff date approaches, 3G customers could see a degradation or complete loss of service, with service centers offering \"limited troubleshooting help.\"<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/\">Verizon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/verizon-3g-shutdown-december-2022/\">Verizon Shutting Down 3G Network on December 31, 2022</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/verizon-shutting-down-3g-network-on-december-31-2022.2290114/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SMDsHHceFkY:UiU9ZoiRTrs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SMDsHHceFkY:UiU9ZoiRTrs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SMDsHHceFkY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a2be11feaf73389e1f8f18a5c9edf83e57284a99c8287528b83f4ff74f2aa288","category":"Apple"}
