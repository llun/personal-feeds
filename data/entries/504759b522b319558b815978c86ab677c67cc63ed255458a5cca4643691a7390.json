The machine made of limestone is almost practical, and intends to render the color of Apple's \"Snow White\" original Macintosh design in a natural material.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Hank-Beyer-Alex-Sizemore-Stone-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782159\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOthers, such as the dirt, ice, or honeycomb-encased Macs, are much more extraordinary and surrealist.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Hank-Beyer-Alex-Sizemore-Ice-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782158\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe entire project began several years ago, and aims to present \"an alternate reality.\" Yet the series of designs are also \"future-forward,\" as companies seek out more sustainable manufacturing processes and materials.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>We don't want people to view our project and feel resentment toward globalization, to feel that we want to replace industry or to consider new materials only for commercial merit.
