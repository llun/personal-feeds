Favero has now confirmed that news with a post on its Instagram account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post shows the text “Shimano Road, July 2021” above an outline picture of its distinctive Assioma spindle-based power meter and the partial outline of Shimano SPD-SL pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Favero added the caption “Shimano road riders: Stay tuned”, effectively confirming what many have hoped for: a Shimano pedal-based power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Favero provided no further information today, it seems certain now the new spindles are compatible with official Shimano pedal bodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garmin has already <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/new-garmin-rally-power-meter-pedal-family-to-include-spd-sl-and-spd-models/\" target=\"_blank\">launched a Shimano-compatible power pedal</a> in the time since the leaked photos and text from Favero surfaced.
