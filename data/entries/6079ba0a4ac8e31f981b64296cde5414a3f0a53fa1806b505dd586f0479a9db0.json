The various trailers seemed so promising, giving off vibes of a \"buddy cop\" action flick, with a bit more room to flesh out the character development and themes.

Sam and Bucky must grapple with losing Steve and the burden of his legacy. Meanwhile, the US government has named its own new Captain America, John Walker (Wyatt Russell), a decorated veteran and ultimate \"good soldier\" who thinks he can better embody \"American values\" than Rogers.
