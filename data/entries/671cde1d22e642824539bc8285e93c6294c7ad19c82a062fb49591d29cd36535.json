Now, security experts are reporting that the source code has been auctioned off on a dark Web forum, seemingly for millions of dollars.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vx-underground.org/\">VX Underground</a>, which tracks ransomware and other malware attacks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1359568916339646466\">noted on Wednesday</a> that the ransomed source code had been posted on a dark Web forum known as EXPLOIT. The starting bid was reportedly $1 million, with a $500,000 bidding increment and $7 million \"buy it now\" price.</p>\n<p>Cyber intelligence firm KELA confirmed the authenticity of that auction, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276664/cyberpunk-witcher-hackers-auction-source-code-ransomware-attack\">telling The Verge</a> that forum users needed to put up 0.1 BTC (roughly $4,700 as of this writing) to participate in the bidding as a sign that offers were legitimate. The sellers also reportedly provided file listings for <em>Gwent</em> and the Red Engine that underlies CDPR's games as proof that the data was authentic.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741880#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741880&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"671cde1d22e642824539bc8285e93c6294c7ad19c82a062fb49591d29cd36535","category":"Tech"}
