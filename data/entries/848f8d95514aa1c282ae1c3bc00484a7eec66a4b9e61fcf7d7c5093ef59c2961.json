Your account must also be active within the last six months and have a record of adherence to the Twitter Rules.</blockquote>Over the next few weeks, all Twitter users will start to see the new verification application form directly in the Account Settings tab. Twitter will be gradually rolling out access to ensure that applications can be reviewed in a timely manner. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you submit your application, you can expect an emailed response from Twitter within a few days, but this could take up to a few weeks depending on how many applications are received, according to the company. If your application is approved, you'll see the blue badge automatically on your Twitter profile. For users who feel they were wrongly denied verified status, there is an option to re-apply 30 days later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTwitter plans to introduce more eligible verified categories later this year, such as those for scientists, academics, and religious leaders. Twitter is also researching automated accounts and plans to introduce a way to denote this account type in the next few months, with memorialized accounts to follow at some point later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/twitter-about-tab.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTwitter also previewed a new \"About\" tab coming to profiles that will allow users to share more details about themselves, including their personal pronouns, location, interests, and more, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-to-revamp-user-profiles-with-about-tab-support-for-pronouns-confirmed-status-and-more/\">according to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The tab will also indicate whether the account has been \"confirmed\" with a verified email address or phone number.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/20/twitter-relaunches-verified-applications/\">Twitter Resumes Verified Account Program, Previews New 'About' Tab on Profiles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-resumes-verified-account-program-previews-new-about-tab-on-profiles.2296931/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rH-GuZD5E40:M9JqbUOT_Hg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rH-GuZD5E40:M9JqbUOT_Hg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rH-GuZD5E40\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"848f8d95514aa1c282ae1c3bc00484a7eec66a4b9e61fcf7d7c5093ef59c2961","category":"Apple"}
