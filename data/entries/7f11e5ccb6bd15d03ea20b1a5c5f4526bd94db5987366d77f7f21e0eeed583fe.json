From earthshaking\nannouncements to retrospectively goofy quotes, there are so many\nmemories that bring a smile to our faces. As we approach WWDC\n2021, let’s take a look back at some of those moments.</p>\n\n<p>Even though WWDC technically started in 1990, let’s start where\nthings got interesting, which is in 1997. Apple was on the brink\nand Steve Jobs had just returned to the company following the NeXT\nacquisition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another reason to start in 1997: there’s not much video surviving from earlier WWDCs. What a remarkable compilation Ortolani has put together here.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/01/wwdc-highlights-through-the-decades\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7f11e5ccb6bd15d03ea20b1a5c5f4526bd94db5987366d77f7f21e0eeed583fe","category":"Tech"}
