{"title":"Demeo is the best multiplayer, virtual-reality D&D clone ever made","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763983","date":1621338359000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-3525-980x551.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          <em>Demeo</em> feels much like a classic, physical session of a tabletop RPG like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>—and it stars these four classes of heroes. You pick them up and move them around a board in VR, and the sensation is fantastic.                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \nHave you ever liked something so much that it made you <em>sad</em>? It's that weird moment when your emotional swing goes over the bar, passing joy and turning into a strange version of regret. I've had this happen with movies I caught years too late, when finally getting a decent pair of headphones, or after learning that cool trick to instantly remove the stickers and plastic on a CD case. The sensation is something along the lines of, \"I would've turned out differently as an adult if I'd had this sooner.\"\n<p>That's how I feel about the new virtual reality game <a href=\"https://www.resolutiongames.com/demeo\"><em>Demeo</em></a>. You can see it in the above gallery: This <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-styled video game recreates the franchise's tactile, turn-based battles with friends. And it's awesome.</p>\n<p>I can move clunky, fantastical miniatures around a board, then watch them come to life to do battle while nearby friends scream in delight and/or agony when a dice roll changes everything at a moment's notice? And all of that happens on-demand within a genius VR implementation? Yes, please. I love this stuff—a blend of tabletop and digital co-op gaming with a dash of real-life presence—and I wish I'd had it earlier. (Specifically, I wish I'd had it for the past 15 months.)</p>\n<p>This recent VR game, available on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484280/Demeo/\" target=\"_blank\">SteamVR</a> and <a href=\"https://fave.co/3fvdUaf\" target=\"_blank\">Oculus Quest for $30</a> as of May 6, is absolutely not perfect. In fact, it's arguably missing a critical \"early access\" tag. Getting through a session of this <em>D&amp;D</em> facsimile without inventing a wish list of additional features may be a challenge, especially if you and your adventuring party have an established regimen of tabletop co-op adventure games.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763983#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763983&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1865737fc787c587ed4c4493ef34fd19b77a3a1cd5c48751746903c1fd174edc","category":"Tech"}
