Apple says that additional third-party manufacturers will offer Find My-enabled products and accessories soon.<blockquote>\"For more than a decade, our customers have relied on &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; to locate their missing or stolen Apple devices, all while protecting their privacy,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \"Now we're bringing the powerful finding capabilities of &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, one of our most popular services, to more people with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network accessory program. We're thrilled to see how Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof are utilizing this technology, and can't wait to see what other partners create.\"</blockquote>Apple has a strict set of rules for devices that are part of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network accessory program, and all third-party products must adhere to all of the privacy protections of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/find-my-app-items-tab.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1306\" height=\"1624\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792938\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nParticipating &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; products will be able to be found in the \"Items\" tab and will have a \"Works with Apple &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;\" badge. You will be able to see &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app under the Items tab, where they can be tracked like Apple products. Third-party accessories can be added to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app on devices running iOS 14.3 and later or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> 11.1 and later. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories will be able to be tracked on a map and there will be an option to play a sound to locate a lost device. Items can be put into a Lost Mode, which locks them to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> and prevents another person from pairing to it. Items can be associated with a phone number and message in case someone finds it, and users can get notifications when an item's location becomes available. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/find-my-lost-mode.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1306\" height=\"1601\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792942\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThird-party &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; devices will be able to take advantage of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network that uses crowdsourced data from millions of Apple devices to detect missing devices or items and report an approximate location back to the owner. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/works-with-apple-find-my.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1298\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792935\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple today also announced a draft specification for chipset manufacturers that will be released later in the spring. It will allow third-party device manufacturers to take advantage of the Ultra Wideband technology in U1-equipped Apple devices, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineups. U1 integration will allow for a more precise, directionally aware item location experience. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/apple-announces-find-my-network-third-party-devices/\">Apple Announces Find My Network With Support for Third-Party Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-find-my-network-with-support-for-third-party-devices.2290936/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YNTKBKAX5ME:kL_XckNn-co:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YNTKBKAX5ME:kL_XckNn-co:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YNTKBKAX5ME\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ee116982ffa57b211fbb9bbe9b4e1e3708cdb629b85072a54d94acbcb05de68","category":"Apple"}
