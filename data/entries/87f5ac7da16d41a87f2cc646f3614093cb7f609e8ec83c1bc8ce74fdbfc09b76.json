{"title":"A second year without Paris-Roubaix: Will The Hell of the North be postponed again?","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-looks-set-to-be-cancelled-again","date":1616437549000,"content":"\n      <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this point, the 2021 cycling season has gone ahead with relatively few issues. This is certainly the case when compared to the 2020 campaign which was decimated due to the global pandemic. Multiple races were cancelled, including for the first time since World War II, Paris-Roubaix.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘The Hell of the North’ is one of cycling’s five monuments and is perhaps the most popular and prestigious one-day race in cycling. However, in an article in La Parisienne on Wednesday it was reported that Paris Roubaix has been postponed for a third time and will not be taking place on April 11th.</span></p>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<p><span>Since then, race organiser ASO <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has spoken</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to French newspaper, L'Equipe, explaining that the official decision regarding the race will not be taken until next week. ASO hope that by drastically reducing the number of spectators on the side of the road, they will be able to hold Paris-Roubaix in a few weeks time, on the original scheduled date.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu spoke to French radio on Thursday, stating that the decision has not yet definitively been taken. \"It's an area where there is a real problem – not enough beds, a lot of sick people,\" she said. \"Maybe the event will have to be postponed.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span></span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were set to witness the inaugural Women’s Paris-Roubaix in 2020, yet this was delayed by a year due to the pandemic. The possible postponement of this year’s event means the first women’s Paris-Roubaix might once again have to wait until a later date.</span> </p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a> </strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking to France Bleu on Monday, Michel Lalande, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who is the prefect of the Hauts-de-France region which encompasses Roubaix, was asked about Paris-Roubaix. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I'll give you an answer when the time is right, but you can guess it”, said Laland.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All WorldTour races for men and women have gone ahead in 2021 thus far, including Strade Bianche, Milan-Sanremo and Trofeo Alfredo Binda. Paris-Roubaix was far from the only event to fall to the pandemic last year, though. Other WorldTour events that were cancelled include the Volta Catalunya, Amstel Gold Race and the Tour de Romandie. However, the Volta Catalunya has returned to the calendar in 2021 and is currently taking place in the northern Spanish region.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB2_5873_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616433052\" alt=\"Roubaix Velodrome 2019\"><em>Paris-Roubaix, 2019 (Alex Broadway/SWpix)</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this news, the Belgian Classics are expected to continue. When asked on this matter, Lalande responded, “<span>Someone will have to explain to me the coherence between the safety precaution for COVID. Someone will have to explain it to me.\"</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Clearly, Lalande was surprised that racing in Belgium is set to continue amidst the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gallery-milan-san-remo-2021\">Related – Milan-San Remo 2021 Gallery</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding to his earlier comments, Lalande said, “The sky now looks less blue”. Many would’ve hoped for the clouds to show themselves on the day of Paris-Roubaix - rain can often shake up the race making it even more unpredictable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that the sky will remain blue and we will see Paris-Roubaix at some point this season.</span></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-UFKPji\"></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"87f5ac7da16d41a87f2cc646f3614093cb7f609e8ec83c1bc8ce74fdbfc09b76","category":"Cycling"}
