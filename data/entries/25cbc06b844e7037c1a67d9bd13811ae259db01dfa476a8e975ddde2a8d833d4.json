{"title":"Kuo: iPhone 13 Lineup to Feature Nearly Identical Wide Camera Lens as iPhone 12","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/kuo-iphone-13-wide-angle-lens/","date":1617179598000,"content":"According to credible Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup, slated for launch in the second half of the year, will feature the same wide-angle lens as the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> series, offering no tangible improvements to one of the three lenses on the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone12protriplelenscamera.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1843\" height=\"985\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-764718\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn an investors note obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, focused mainly on developments and changes within Apple's supply chain, Kuo says the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini, &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro will feature the same 7P wide-angle lens with a ƒ1.6 aperture as their respective &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; counterparts. The larger &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro Max will have a ƒ1.5 aperture wide-angle lens, a marginal increase compared to the ƒ1.6 aperture on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo states that Sunny Optical will be the new supplier for the 7P wide-angle lens, adding that mass production of the camera system could begin as soon as May. Looking more long-term, Kuo says that the demand for optical lenses for Apple devices will only significantly increase in the next few years thanks to AR and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>We expect Sunny Optical to successfully pass the quality verification of the 7P wide-angle lens order for &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;. Because &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini, 13, and 13 Pro share the same f1.6 7P wide-angle lens (vs. 13 Pro Max's f1.5 7P wide-angle lens), so Sunny Optical's order is the most in-demand. We estimate that Sunny Optical will ship the 7P wide-angle lens of the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; to LG Innotek as soon as May.</blockquote>While the 2021 iPhones, according to Kuo, will not have a significantly different wide-angle lens, it is rumored to pack improvements to the ultra wide lens. According to Barclays analysts, all four &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/iphone-13-upgraded-ultra-wide-lens-rumor/\">will include upgraded Ultra Wide lenses</a> with a ƒ/1.8 aperture, vs. the ƒ/2.4 aperture on the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAside from the camera lens, well-connected display analyst Ross Young has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-13-lineup-rumored-120hz-iphone-se-3-2022/\">predicted</a> that the camera sensor size of both the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;‌ Pro and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;‌ Pro Max will increase. Although Young doesn't state which of the three cameras will gain a larger sensor, a larger sensor would, in turn, have larger pixels. In other words, the sensor could collect more light, resulting in materially better image quality.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEarlier this month, Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">reported</a> that Apple plans to include a smaller notch and larger batteries for the entire &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup. Exclusive to the higher-end Pro and Pro Max models will be a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/28/120hz-promotion-display-iphone-13/\">ProMotion 120Hz display</a>, according to the analyst.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPreviously, Kuo has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/sensor-shift-all-iphone-13-models-rumor/\">said</a> the &zwnj;iPhone 12 Pro Max&zwnj;'s sensor-shift image stabilization will expand to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/kuo-iphone-13-wide-angle-lens/\">Kuo: iPhone 13 Lineup to Feature Nearly Identical Wide Camera Lens as iPhone 12</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-13-lineup-to-feature-nearly-identical-wide-camera-lens-as-iphone-12.2290179/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-6y0HRa5EwY:HqHGJA3hQS8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-6y0HRa5EwY:HqHGJA3hQS8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-6y0HRa5EwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"25cbc06b844e7037c1a67d9bd13811ae259db01dfa476a8e975ddde2a8d833d4","category":"Apple"}
