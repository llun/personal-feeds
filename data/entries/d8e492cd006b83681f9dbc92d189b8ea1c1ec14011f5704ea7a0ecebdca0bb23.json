The feature is available in the latest beta version of the Plex app through TestFlight.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-tv-app-plex.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"997\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784610\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThis integration will enable users to keep track of Plex's on-demand content in Apple's TV app across the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Plex's on-demand content will be recommended in the TV app and also sync with a user's Up Next queue. Plex joins dozens of other providers offering TV app integration in the United States, such as HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Peacock, HGTV, NBC, A&E, The CW, MTV, Showtime, Starz, and others.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPlex is a popular media player that in recent years has introduced a growing library of free, ad-supported TV shows, movies, and other content from providers such as Warner Bros., Crackle, Lionsgate, MGM, and Legendary Entertainment. It is only this on-demand content that will be integrated in the TV app, and not a user's personal library of locally stored content, according to a Reddit user identifying as a Plex employee.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"This feature will only work with our free on demand movies and TV shows,\" the employee <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/lniiij/plex_testing_tv_app_integration_across_iphone/go16q8r/\">said</a>. \"We'd love to integrate personal media as well but that's not technically possible for a couple reasons. To make this work we provide Apple with a list of content we have available for streaming. As detailed in our privacy policy, we don't know what content our users have in their personal media libraries.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Did…did Plex just add Apple TV app integration with their latest beta (7.14)… &#x1f92f; <a href=\"https://t.co/M2gG82kvSi\">pic.twitter.com/M2gG82kvSi</a></p>&mdash; Will Sigmon (@WSig) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WSig/status/1362501707704467457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 18, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacRumors?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MacRumors</a> looks like Plex is finally doing TV app integration. beta of 14.5 and the Plex beta <a href=\"https://t.co/V0JSn53HFu\">pic.twitter.com/V0JSn53HFu</a></p>&mdash; Casey Bailey (@reptarwilleatu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reptarwilleatu/status/1362770623798382594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nTV app integration will require version 7.14 of the Plex app or later, currently in beta testing.
