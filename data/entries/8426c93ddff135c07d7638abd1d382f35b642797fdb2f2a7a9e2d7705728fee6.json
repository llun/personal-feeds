(Use the <strong>Restart</strong> icon in the upper left corner to rewind the memory.)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>If you come across a song you like, simply tap the screen, and the music and look will be applied to your memory. Alternately, tap the <strong>Music icon</strong> (the musical note with the + sign) to select another track. \r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ios-15-memories-music-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>You can browse ‌Apple Music‌'s Top Suggested songs and other categories, or tap the <strong>Search icon</strong> at the top to find a specific song in your music library. </li> \r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> when you've chosen a song to preview it in your memory, then tap the screen and the music will be applied to your memory.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ios-15-memories-music-2.jpg\" /></li></ol>In addition to ‌Apple Music‌ integration, ‌Photos‌ also features new Memory types, including new international holidays, child-focused memories, trends over time, and improved pet memories, including the ability to recognize individual dogs and cats.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/add-apple-music-songs-memories-photos/\">iOS 15: How to Add Apple Music Songs to Your Memories in Photos</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-how-to-add-apple-music-songs-to-your-memories-in-photos.2302803/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kpmVRQmidIA:SoUwuaHTZks:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kpmVRQmidIA:SoUwuaHTZks:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kpmVRQmidIA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8426c93ddff135c07d7638abd1d382f35b642797fdb2f2a7a9e2d7705728fee6","category":"Apple"}
