The ‌iPad Pro‌'s camera has a different lens design than the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> camera, which allows it to focus on things that are much closer to the sensor.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone‌ focuses to about eight centimeters, but the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>'s camera can get a lot closer, allowing for macro shots that aren't possible on an ‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nde With says that he was using the ‌iPad‌ on his lap when he noticed that it focused perfectly on his pant leg, leading him to try it with other objects. \"‌iPad‌ basically comes with a microscope,\" he says.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe rear camera in the 11 and 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models has not changed from the prior-generation camera used in the 2020 models, so older ‌iPad‌ Pros also seem to be able to use this close-up shot functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt can be difficult to get the ‌iPad Pro‌ camera to focus with the LiDAR sensor-assisted autofocus feature, so de With recommends a camera app like Halide for ‌iPad‌ to put it into a manual focus mode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe biggest change to the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> ‌iPad Pro‌ models comes in the form a revamped front-facing camera that enables a new Ultra Wide \"Center Stage\" feature that's designed to pan and zoom with you as you move around a room while on video calls.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ultra Wide camera functionality used for Center Stage has a 120 degree field of view, but it's all done with software rather than hardware. There's still a single front-facing camera in the ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ that handles both the standard focal length and the wider view.<blockquote>The ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ has those 12 megapixels packed into the front-facing camera system to enable a more seamless 'dual camera system': one that is entirely created in software. The camera is ultra-wide and only ultra-wide; thanks to software corrections and extra megapixels, the system can just crop that wide and detailed camera feed down to its old focal length.</blockquote>The standard front-facing camera view is cropped in from the wide-angle view, something that Apple has also done on the latest ‌iPhone‌ models. de With says that Apple's Center Stage feature is a \"very impressive bit of software\" that can only be achieved with a tight integration of software and hardware.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe full overview of the ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ camera can be <a href=\"https://lux.camera/the-m1-ipad-pro-cameras/\">read on the Halide website</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/\">Halide</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/ipad-pro-macro-camera-feature/\">Halide Developer Highlights Hidden Macro Camera Feature in 2021 iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/halide-developer-highlights-hidden-macro-camera-feature-in-2021-ipad-pro.2297954/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TM5LGOMtgps:okhmRRWLg4c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TM5LGOMtgps:okhmRRWLg4c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/TM5LGOMtgps\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b9784ddd9de91e1eac42dd56ec4431e1f2c8a4587b6ab3cb5f74e2cf2e287612","category":"Apple"}
