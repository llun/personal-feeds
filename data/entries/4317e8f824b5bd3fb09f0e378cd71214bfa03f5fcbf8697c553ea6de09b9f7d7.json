Marc Soler took the stage 3 win at the Tour de Romandie, Lorena Wiebes won the prologue at the Ceratizit Festival Elsy Jacobs, and Nairo Quintana won the opening stage of the Vuelta Asturias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for the latest from the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dane Cash<br />News Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Marc Soler wins stage 3 and takes the lead at the Tour de Romandie</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marc Soler</strong> picked up his first win of the year on a rainy stage 3 of the Tour de Romandie on Friday, moving into the overall lead in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 27-year-old Spaniard attacked out of a reduced peloton on the final climb of the day, soloing clear with around 10 km to go. <strong>Ion Izagirre</strong> gave chase, but was unable to close down the gap and was eventually swept up by the pack. Soler, however, held on comfortably, taking the win with a 22-second gap back to the chasers. <strong>Magnus Cort</strong> topped <strong>Peter Sagan</strong> to nab second out of the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overnight leader <strong>Rohan Dennis</strong> crashed on the rain-slicked roads and finished 1:21 down on Soler, who moved into the GC lead. Soler will take a 14-second lead over Geraint Thomas into Saturday’s stage 4.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n
