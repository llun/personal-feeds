T-Mobile was third with $9.34 billion as the three biggest wireless carriers accounted for the vast majority of the $81.17 billion in winning bids, the Federal Communications Commission said in <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-announces-winning-bidders-37-ghz-service-auction\">results released yesterday</a>.

This spectrum will help carriers boost network capacity with mid-band frequencies that cover large geographic areas and penetrate walls more effectively than the higher millimeter-wave frequencies that provide the fastest 5G speeds to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/04/millimeter-wave-5g-will-never-scale-beyond-dense-urban-areas-t-mobile-says/\">very limited</a> geographic areas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745108#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745108&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e9ef0329441fe5beb3fbed18bc6937ec8a68aac00576ae527530f76653309ab","category":"Tech"}
