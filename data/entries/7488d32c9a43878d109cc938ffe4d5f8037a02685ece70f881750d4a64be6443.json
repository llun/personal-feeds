I gotta show how badass any old bike can be with a set of fly bars and a rattle can paint job. I gotta make the dopest State OG Klunkers imaginable. I just have to find some homies in Phoenix (State&#8217;s homebase), and sell them on the most fliest State Klunker builds possible &#8211; deck them out the best I know how.</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;\"><iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZRREqAYm84\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And then let everyone love/hate them with me.

I wanted to make a couple of these as baddddd as possible. Wheels. Tires. Bars. Stem. Well, mostly everything. I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8211; I didn&#8217;t throw away much from the original state builds, other than the reflectors maybe. They are very respectable stock builds for under four benjies. And, while I didn’t get an exact weight on them, they are not nearly as heavy as they look. My ‘62 Schwinn weighs 38 lbs and the OGs are lighter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1619\" height=\"2024\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207619\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?w=1619&amp;quality=75 1619w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-19.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1619px) 100vw, 1619px\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s start with Josh&#8217;s bike. The man behind the barrage of vintage media here. He shot that film on Super 8 and took the photos you see with his collection of film cameras older than many of you reading this.

Throw the 3.5&#8243; rise brazed Meal Replacement Bar (MRB) to replace the State chrome risers and matchy tan odyssey grips to add some cruise to this cruiser. A silver 6-bolt bmx Thomson stem and seatpost round out the legit build (the post was like 25.4 or something funky, but leave it to Thomson to stock those for us).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1619\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207617\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?w=2024&amp;quality=75 2024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=2000,1600&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=1800,1440&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-21.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px\" /></p>\n<p>My better half, Erika, knocked it out of the park with the paint job on both bikes. The diamond fade with a silver accent on Josh’s bike was about as classic as we could get. She&#8217;s got a degree in painting, and it shows (well, maybe not in rattle canning klunkers, but a canvas is a canvas), and is no slouch using the vinyl cutter either.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1619\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207628\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?w=2024&amp;quality=75 2024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=2000,1600&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=1800,1440&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-9.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px\" /></p>\n<p>I wanted to take Bryan&#8217;s build in a different direction, well, really the same direction, but different. For the wheels, I thought going 26 and chubby would be a hot move on one of these 27.5 x 2.2 frame/forks. Erika, who is also our in-house wheel builder, let me lace the 48h radial front and she took care of the hub rebuild and lacing the rear to wider Velocity Duallys. Paid full pop on eBay for two 26 x 2.8 Minions, but we just had to have them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1619\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207625\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?w=2024&amp;quality=75 2024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=2000,1600&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=1800,1440&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-12.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px\" /></p>\n<p>The wheel/tire combo juuust fit in the frame and cleared the fork just fine.

Well, I don&#8217;t really say that, but the Selle saddle is pretty damn cool.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1564\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207633\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?w=2024&amp;quality=75 2024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=1024,791&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=2000,1545&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=768,593&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=1800,1391&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=1335,1032&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=700,541&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-4.jpg?resize=1536,1187&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1619\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207623\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?w=2024&amp;quality=75 2024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=2000,1600&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=1800,1440&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/Klunkers-14.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2024px) 100vw, 2024px\" /></p>\n<p>Bryan’s bike also got a MRB (a full 4.5” rise) topped off with Odyssey grips.

They&#8217;re an assault on every sensibility of the informed Radavist reader. But it&#8217;s just something about the stripped-down coaster bike for everyone. It makes so much sense. Hopping them up with our premium coaster wheels and bars made sense to us too.
