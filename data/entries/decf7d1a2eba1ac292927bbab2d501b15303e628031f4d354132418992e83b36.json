{"title":"Google Pixel Watch Allegedly Leaks with Circular Design, Rumored to Launch in October","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/google-pixel-watch-leak-with-circular-design/","date":1618220951000,"content":"<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10miOSKEdpStK915nQVG1SqLyRaRS2WPy\">Renders</a> of Google's first smartwatch, codenamed \"Rohan,\" have been shared by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a>, showing that Google plans to adopt a circular design for its flagship wearable watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/pixel-watch-prosser-leak.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nProsser shared the renders in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xioX3XTRomM\">an episode</a> of his YouTube show \"Front Page Tech,\" in which he claims they were made based on marketing material he had seen from a source within Google. The renders show that the Pixel Watch will adopt a bezel-less, circular design, with no buttons, except for a crown on the right.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/pixel-watch-screen-prosser-leak.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe display itself, unlike the Apple Watch, features a completely circular form factor. Internally, the Pixel Watch will feature a heart rate sensor, but it so far remains unknown if it sports more advanced health features such as blood oxygen monitoring on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/pixel-watch-design-prosser-leak.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLike the Apple Watch, which allows users to swap and change bands, Google will offer around 20 band options for the Pixel Watch, according to Prosser. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe watch will presumably run WearOS, Google's operating systems for smartwatches. As for a release, Prosser says the watch will debut \"sometime in October\" but warns to be cautious given Google's habit of delaying and even canceling products altogether.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2019, Google signed a $40 million deal with watchmaker Fossil to take <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/18/google-buys-fossil-smartwatch-tech-40-million/\">ownership of its smartwatch division</a>. As a result of the deal, Fossil smartwatches joined Google's WearOS family and also spurred widespread speculation that Google intends to make its own-branded smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBesides changes to make it thinner, lighter, and the screen bigger thanks to smaller bezels, the Apple Watch design has largely remained the same since its launch in 2015. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-redesigned-wrap-around-apple-watch/\">recent patent</a> has revealed that Apple is researching an Apple Watch design with a display that wraps around the band, where in turn, the watch band becomes an extension of the display itself. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/google-pixel-watch-leak-with-circular-design/\">Google Pixel Watch Allegedly Leaks with Circular Design, Rumored to Launch in October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-pixel-watch-allegedly-leaks-with-circular-design-rumored-to-launch-in-october.2291420/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_dYjjS3LKrE:VN_4_o9Bkm0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_dYjjS3LKrE:VN_4_o9Bkm0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_dYjjS3LKrE\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"decf7d1a2eba1ac292927bbab2d501b15303e628031f4d354132418992e83b36","category":"Apple"}
