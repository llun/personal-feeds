If you unmention yourself from there, the Tweet author will not be able to mention you again. <a href=\"https://t.co/RTFBEnkPFf\">pic.twitter.com/RTFBEnkPFf</a></p>— Dominic Camozzi (@_dcrc_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_dcrc_/status/1404578216019324933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 14, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, Camozzi is toying with the idea of giving users the ability to \"control mass mentions\" by preventing anyone on the platform from mentioning them for one day, three days, or seven days, thereby providing respite for anyone inundated with activity related to their account.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with all early concepts, these changes may or may not be implemented by Twitter, and the company is actively looking for feedback from users regarding the ideas.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/twitter-unmention-feature-010207232.html\">Engadget</a>.) </em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/twitter-unmention-yourself-from-tweets/\">Twitter May Let You 'Unmention' Yourself in Tweets and Prevent You From Being Tagged in Future Replies</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-may-let-you-unmention-yourself-in-tweets-and-prevent-you-from-being-tagged-in-future-replies.2301113/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oJQgilNuFUE:LDzgf-WodCA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oJQgilNuFUE:LDzgf-WodCA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oJQgilNuFUE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6040c3980380b9d1804992f3ccd7240dd2a3ec58b470766568e836714d2facbb","category":"Apple"}
