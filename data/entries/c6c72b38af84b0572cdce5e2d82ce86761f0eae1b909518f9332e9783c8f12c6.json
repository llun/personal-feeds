This means we will see a supercharged startlist, with the likes of Chris Froome and Tadej Pogačar in attendance.</p>\n<p>The 2021 route features an individual time-trial for the first time since 2018, which takes place on stage two around Hudayriat Island. 13 kilometres in length, it will be the first chance for the GC challengers to gain time. Filippo Ganna will attempt to win his eighth time-trial in a row, a streak which runs back to the Italian National Championships last August. Certainties do not exist in cycling, but if they did, Ganna will win stage two.</p>\n<p>The climbs to Jebel Hafeet on stage three (10.6km @ 6.8%) and Jebel Jais on stage five (21.5km @ 5.4%) are the two queen stages in the UAE. Jebel Hafeet was ridden twice at last year’s race, where Adam Yates and Tadej Pogačar both won. It was Yates’ win on stage three which secured him the GC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/download_4_1024x1024.png?v=1613665051\" alt=\"UAE Tour stage 3\"></p>\n<p><em>Stage five of the UAE Tour, which finishes atop Jebel Jais (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>The other four stages are flat as a pancake and will be contested in a mass-sprint. The only notable emission from the route is the wall of Hatta Dam.</p>\n<p>The leading favourite here has to be Tadej Pogačar. At the team’s home race, the Tour de France champ will look to improve on his second place overall last season, where he was disappointed to lose to Adam Yates at his team’s home race. He will be helped by Davide Fomolo and Diego Ulissi, who returns after being diagnosed with myocarditis.</p>\n<p>Adam Yates won the UAE Tour last year and debuts for the INEOS Grenadiers this time around. He is a one-week race specialist and could well be the opponent Pogačar fears most. As ever, the INEOS team is strong, with Filippo Ganna, Daniel Martínez and Tour de la Provence winner Iván Sosa starting. The time-trial will put-pay to Sosa’s GC chances here, though.</p>\n<p>We will see João Almeida back in action for the first time after his stupendous performance at the Giro d’Italia, where he claimed the maglia rosa on stage three and held it until stage eighteen. The Portuguese is now a name to be reckoned with and starts as a genuine threat to win the UAE Tour.</p>\n<p>Other GC protagonists include Rigoberto Urán, Emanuel Buchmann, Wout Poels, Alexey Lutsenko, Sepp Kuss and who knows, perhaps Chris Froome. The Brit is making his debut for Israel Start-Up as he aims to get back to his best with the Israeli outfit.</p>\n<p>The race is well suited to the sprinters with four clear opportunities to win – this can be seen with the sprinters present in the UAE. Caleb Ewan, Sam Bennett, Pascal Ackermann and Giacomo Nizzolo are the headline names.</p>\n<p>Fernando Gaviria had a down-year in 2020 and struggled at the Clásica de Almería earlier in 2021 – he will be desperate to get back to winning ways, and UAE-Team Emirates will be equally keen to wrack up the wins on home soil.</p>\n<p>Another sprinter to look out for is Jasper Philipsen who starts alongside Mathieu van der Poel for Alpecin-Fenix. Philipsen will likely sprint for his new team – he won stage 15 at La Vuelta last season. It will be intriguing to see what role Van der Poel is to play at the race, with the GC too difficult for him.</p>\n<p>One final sprinter we will be keeping a keen eye on is Stefan Bissegger. The 22-year-old Swiss is talented in both time-trialling and sprinting. With no other sprinters in their line-up, EF Education-NIPPO will give him an opportunity after a good display at the Binckbank Tour last year.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Tadej Pogačar, Adam Yates, João Almeida</p>\n<p><strong>Dark horses:</strong> Emanuel Buchmann, Sepp Kuss, Alejandro Valverde, Patrick Konrad, Jack Haig, Chris Froome</p>\n<h4><b>Omloop het Nieuwsblad - WT (27/02)</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032619-003_1024x1024_a752da38-9638-4bce-9397-4a004b49d576_1024x1024.jpg?v=1613409010\" alt=\"\"></b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-2021-preview\"><em><b>Read our full Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2021: Preview</b></em></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘The season doesn’t start until Omloop!’ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first of the Flanders Classics, Omloop het Nieuwsblad kicks-off Belgium's opening weekend on Saturday. Omloop includes many of the most revered cobbled climbs in Flanders, including the Muur and the Bosberg, both can create a selective group of riders in the final 20 kilometres. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This race is crucial for those looking to focus on the Spring Classics. The 2020 edition saw Trek’s Jasper Stuyven arriving at the finish alongside countryman Yves Lampaert, who was beaten by Stuyven in a sprint. Both men will return this season among the favourites. But they will face fierce competition.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Royal Bernard Drome Classic - 1.Pro (27/02) </b></h4>\n<p>The racing in France does not stop for Belgium’s opening weekend, with two difficult races taking place in the Ardèche region. The Royal Bernard Drome Classic was introduced in 2013 as 1.1 category event, but has since risen to .Pro status.</p>\n<p>The riders will start and finish in Eurre, south-west of Grenoble. A gruelling 200km is on the cards with climbs aplenty. It wouldn't come as a surprise to see half the field DNF. The Col de la Grande Limite (3.8km @ 6.6%) and the Cote des Roberts (1.6km @ 8%) will force many riders out the back.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/download_2_1024x1024.png?v=1613666563\" alt=\"Royal Bernard Drome Classic\"></p>\n<p><em>Royal Bernard Drome Classic (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Previous winners include Romain Bardet and Lillian Calmejane. The 2020 edition was decided in a three-up sprint between Vincenzo Nibali, Warren Barguil and Simon Clarke, with the Aussie ending victorious.</p>\n<p>Although the startlist is still provisional, some very good riders plan on startling, headlined by Marc Hirschi. It was thought that the Swiss would make his UAE-Team Emirates debut at the UAE Tour, but will ride in France instead. The parcours suit him in France making him the leading favourite.</p>\n<p>Like Hirschi, they successive short climbs will work in the favour of Mike Woods. The Canadian has punch in abundance, it helped him finish on the podium at La Flèche Wallonne behind Hirschi last year. He will lead Israel Start-Up here.</p>\n<p>Thibaut Pinot and David Gaudu ride for Groupama-FDJ, with both looking to build their season for the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France – their respective goals.</p>\n<p>The Royal Bernard Drome Classic will give us our first opportunity to see American Quinn Simmons in action this year. Coming off an impressive neo-pro year with Trek-Segafredo, Simmons will look to get his head down this season. The route suits him, and he cannot be counted out.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Marc Hirschi, Mike Woods, Warren Barguil</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Horses:</strong> Quinn Simmons, Magnus Cort, Guillaume Martin</p>\n<h4><b>Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne - 1.Pro (28/02)</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Jungels_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612203018\" alt=\"Bob Jungels\"></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bob Jungels won Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne in 2019.

Although featuring the Oude-Kwaremont, the main difficulties take place further from the finish line, with the final 50km largely flat. This means a sprint is more likely, but the previous two editions have seen a Deceuninck-Quick Step rider go solo late on to win - Bob Jungels did just that in 2019 and Kasper Asgreen in 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The winner should be undeterred by crosswinds or other adverse weather which seem to be ever-present at KBK. We can expect similar contenders to Omloop, leaning slightly towards the sprinters.</span></p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Faun-Ardèche Classic</strong><b> - 1.Pro (28/02)</b>\n</h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Cavagna_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612203049\" alt=\"Remi Cavagna\"></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remi Cavagna won the Faun-Archeche Classic in 2020. (Image credit: </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></i></p>\n<p>The Faun-Archeche Classic is a compelling race in its own right which can be decided in a reduced sprint or with a long-range attack. The Saint-Romain-de-Lerps is the major difficulty at 6.1km and 7.2%, but lots of other short climbs will undoubtedly sap the legs of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Remi Cavagna went solo early in 2020 and was not seen again, winning by a whopping two minutes and 51 seconds. Only 43 riders finished, with distinct groups few and far between as riders battled just to reach the finish in the wake of Cavagna. More of the same in 2021 please!</p>\n<p>The riders on the startline closely mirror the Royal Bernard Drome Classic, which takes place the day before. This means that Marc Hirschi will start as one of the main protagonists again. Although, the weekend in France will be Hirschi’s first racings days of the calendar year, so we can’t be sure of his form just yet.</p>\n<p>Magnus Cort is a strong rider who can withstand climbs, whilst also possessing a very quick sprint finish. The combination of these two abilities have helped the Dane claim stages at the Tour de France and Vuelta Espana. If he is there in the final kilometres he could be very difficult to stop.</p>\n<p>Warren Barguil found his calling card last season in the one-day classics. He had previously been focusing on stage races but finished in the top-5 at Liege-Bastogne-Liege and La Flèche Wallonne, as well as fourth place at the Faun Ardèche Classic last season. He has displayed all the qualities required to win this race for Arkéa–Samsic.</p>\n<p>Like Arkéa, AG2R Citroën will be desperate to do well on home soil. They look to bring a powerful team which features new recruit Bob Jungels, Dorian Godon and Nans Peters – all of whom could launch a successful long-range attack.</p>\n<p>Favourites: Marc Hirschi, Magnus Cort, Warren Barguil, Bob Jungels</p>\n<p>Outsiders: Odd Christian Eiking, Jacopo Mosca, Dorian Godon</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Strade Bianche - 1</strong><b>.WT (06/03)</b>\n</h4>\n<p>Without question, Strade Bianche is one of, if not the most beautiful races of the season.</p>\n<p>Strade Bianche is the first WorldTour level classic that takes place on Italian soil. The race takes place in central Italy, just south of Firenze in Tuscan hills, making for a sumptuous setting.</p>\n<p>The riders will take on over 3000 metres of climbing throughout the day, which is incredible because there are few climbs longer than one kilometre in length! Constant short hills and descents await the competition, making this a race of attrition. Strade Bianche is unique in the sense that gravel roads are scattered throughout, a rare sight in a road race. The winner must be strong in many senses if they are to cross the line victorious in the Sienna.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Strade_1024x1024.png?v=1613667985\" alt=\"Strade Bianche\"></p>\n<p><em>Strade Bianche, 2021 profile (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Only 42 of the 166 starters finished the race in 2020, displaying Strade’s brutality to perfection. Wout Van Aert won solo in Sienna that day after attacking with 12km to go, dropping Davide Formolo and Maxi Schachmann, who both finished on the podium.</p>\n<p>It was Van Aert’s first of six victories in 2020 on the road. He will kick-off his 2021 season in Italy as he looks to make it back-to-back victories on the famous white Italian roads. He perhaps starts as the out-and-out favourite, as ever, though, the competition is stellar.</p>\n<p>2019 winner Julian Alaphilippe is back at Strade after missing the race in 2020. Deceuninck have a strong line-up in Italy, where 2015 winner Zdeněk Štybar will join Alaphilippe. The Czech man has wracked up a series of impressive results here — since his win in 2015 he has finished in the top-10 every year.</p>\n<p>Jakob Fuglsang is a man to be reckoned with in the classics. He was just beaten to the line by Alaphilippe in 2019 and finished in the top-5 last year. Although he has never won the race, Fuglsang will start as a premier contender.</p>\n<p>UAE-Team Emirates finished second last year with Davide Formolo, and clearly have intentions of going one better this year, bringing Marc Hirschi and Tadej Pogačar to join up with Formolo in Italy. We know Formolo can go well here, and although Hirschi and Pogačar have never finished in the top-10, the race should suit them.</p>\n<p>Tim Wellens is a rider that always starts the season well and proved that again this year by winning a stage and the overall classification at Étoile de Bessèges. He has only ridden Strade twice but finished in the top-10 on both occasions, including a podium finish in 2017.</p>\n<p>Strade Bianche is one race that Greg Van Avermaet is yet to conquer in his illustrious career. He finished second in 2015 and 2017, beaten by Štybar and Kwiatkwoski respectively. After finishing eighth in 2020, GVA will look to put that record straight with his new team AG2R Citroën.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, one more rider we must mention, Mathieu van der Poel – heard of him? He only managed 15<sup>th</sup> last year in his first appearance at the race, but the gravelled, hilly roads should suit his style. He will be disappointed not to improve on that result this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Jakob Fuglsang, Julian Alaphilippe, Wout Van Aert, Zdeněk Štybar, Tim Wellens</p>\n<p><strong>Dark horses:</strong> Tom Pidcock, Matej Mohorič, Søren Kragh Andersen, Quinn Simmons</p>\n<p><strong>Paris–Nice - 2.WT (07/03-14/03)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-nice-2021-preview\"><strong><em>Read our full Paris-Nice preview</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>Paris-Nice is the inaugural European WorldTour stage race of the season.</p>\n<p>Raced across eight days, Paris-Nice holds great prestige in cycling — the first edition took place in 1933. Sean Kelly gained legendary-status at Paris-Nice when he won seven years in a row from 1982-1988.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ParisNice_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614014701\" alt=\"Paris-Nice\"><em>Image credit: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWpix</em></p>\n<p>As the name states, riders and teams will begin in France’s capital and finish on the Southern coast in Nice. ‘The Race to the Sun’, as the race is often called, signifies that the riders often are subject to harsh conditions in Northern France across the first few stages, before finishing in the sunshine on the Southern Coast.</p>\n<h4><strong>Route</strong></h4>\n<p>The race features eight stages, with a mixture of flat terrain, mountains, time-trials, and everything in between. The first day is full of short climbs on a circuit around Saint-Cyr-l'École, whilst stage two is the first clear opportunity for the sprinters. Stage three around Gien is the only time-trial on this year’s route. At only 14km, it is not the longest but requires the GC-favourites to be on-form. Pippo Ganna will not be present in France, so there will be a chance for someone else to win the stage, too!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PNS1fr_1024x1024.png?v=1614015367\" alt=\"Stage 1 of Paris-Nice 2021 \"><em>Stage 1 of Paris-Nice 2021 (Image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Stage four is a brutal day to Chiroubles with over 3500 metres of climbing. T<span>he riders finish atop a climb of 7.7km @ 5.5%. After a flat day on stage five, stage six features one of the longest climbs of the race: the Col du Ferrier. </span>The climb takes place mid-way through the stage which finishes in Biot. Stage seven is the queen stage and finishes atop the Valdeblore La Colmiane (16.3km @ 6.2%), whilst the final stage is the typical stage in and around Nice, featuring an array of famous climbs including Col d’Eze.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PNS1_1024x1024.png?v=1614015396\" alt=\"Stage 8 of Paris-Nice 2021 \"><em>Stage 8 of Paris-Nice 2021 (Image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Contenders</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Primoz_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614015434\" alt=\"Primoz Roglic\"></strong><em>Primoz Roglic in the yellow jersey at the 2020 Tour de France (Image credit: Alex Whitehead/SWpix)</em></p>\n<p>Maxi Schachmann is the reigning winner of Paris-Nice. He won stage one last year and held the yellow jersey for the entire race, despite showing some weakness on the Valdeblore La Colmiane. The German returns this year and the presence of a time-trial and plenty of short hills will give him a chance of going back-to-back.</p>\n<p>However, there is one stand-out favourite in France. This is Primoz Roglic’s first appearance at Paris-Nice and he will be making his season debut at the race this year. The last time we saw Roglic in a bike race, he was riding to victory at the Vuelta Espana, just holding off Richard Carapaz’ late surge. If Roglic is on form, he will be <em>very</em> difficult to beat.</p>\n<p>As ever, the INEOS Grenadiers enter the race with a strong team. Richie Porte and Tao Geoghegan Hart could lead the British outfit, both riders achieved a Grand Tour podium last season.</p>\n<p>Thibaut Pinot announced that he will be riding the Giro d’Italia instead of the Tour de France later in the year, therefore, David Gaudu will lead Groupama-FDJ at the 2021 Tour de France. The Frenchman will continue to prepare for the race in France at Paris-Nice. He ended 2020 in fine form when he claimed two stage wins at the Vuelta a España and is improving every season. If that continues, he could threaten here.</p>\n<p>Jai Hindley was runner-up to Tao Geoghegan Hart at the Giro last year in a nail-biting finish. He will kick-off his 2021 campaign at Paris-Nice with renewed expectations: one of the strongest climbers in the peloton. The time-trial will hamper him, though he still should be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites: </strong>Primož Roglič</p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders: </strong>David Gaudu, Alex Vlasov, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Jai Hindley, Wout Poels</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Milan-San Remo </strong><b>- 1.WT (20/03)</b>\n</h4>\n<p>The monuments have arrived!</p>\n<p>We have made it to the first of cycling’s five monuments, Milan-San Remo. ‘La Classicissima’, is a historic race with 111 editions, where Eddy Merckx holds the record for the most all-time wins with an astonishing seven to his name. The race is famous for its length – 300km makes it one of the longest days in the saddle for the riders.</p>\n<p>The 2020 edition was won by Wout Van Aert, who claimed the first monument of his career when he defeated Julian Alaphilippe in a sprint. The duo went clear of the bunch on the Poggio and were able to hold their lead until the finish.</p>\n<p>The course has been altered this year due to a landslide on the Passo del Turchino, meaning the peloton will take on the Colle di Giovo instead earlier in the day. Nonetheless, the heart-racing finale remains. The Cipressa (5.5km @ 4.1%) is the first obstacle of note, which comes at kilometre 277. The tempo will no doubt be ramped up here, as the offensive teams look to put the sprinters in to the red zone.</p>\n<p>Following a descent and short flat section, the famous Poggio (3.5km @ 3.8%) comes at kilometre 293. On its own it isn’t the most strenuous of climbs, but with a leg-sapping 290km in the legs and the punchers desperate to escape the clutches of the sprinters, this climb is as challenging as they come.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/msr_1024x1024.png?v=1613668749\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021\"></p>\n<p><em>Milan-San Remo profile 2021 (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>The finish in Milan-San Remo has been designed with consideration — it provides both the sprinters and the attackers a chance to win in almost equal measure. As of late, it has been the punchers that have come out on top — Arnaud Démare was the last pure sprinter to win, crossing the line first in 2016.</p>\n<p>If a sprinter is to win the 112<sup>th</sup> Milan-San Remo, Demare is as good a bet as any. He showed he can still climb well when he claimed stage 7 of the Giro d’Italia to Matera last year.</p>\n<p>Peter Sagan is set to start in Italy again this year. The Slovak seems to suit the terrain in Italy without flaw, but he has never managed to come out on top despite six(!) top-five finishes. As always, he will be among the key favourites.</p>\n<p>Giacomo Nizzolo and Davide Ballerini have both started 2021 in great form, winning at the Clásica de Almería and Tour de la Provence respectively. Both riders have proven they can resist when riding up climbs and are clearly in great shape this year. Riding on home soil, do not rule either rider out.</p>\n<p>Caleb Ewan, Sam Bennett and Pascal Ackermann are pure sprinters who should do well if they are in the front group for the finale. Whether they can withstand the attacks on the Poggio is their question mark.</p>\n<p>As ever, Julian Alaphilippe will be doing his utmost to cause havoc for the fast men and everyone else in the race. It’s inevitable that the world champion will attack on the Poggio and do his best to go to the line either solo or in a reduced group.</p>\n<p>One of the breakout stars of 2020 is set to start at MSR for the second time in his career — Marc Hirschi. He seems to have similar qualities to Alaphilippe, which he displayed at the Tour de France and in the World Championships last season. He has a great burst in the finish and is a confident descender — an ability which will be beneficial on the Poggio.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel made his debut at San Remo last season and managed 13<sup>th</sup> place. The Dutchman will enter the race as a hot favourite this season – the Poggio climb should suit him.
