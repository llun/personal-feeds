Sean Kelly gained legendary-status at Paris-Nice when he won seven years in a row from 1982-1988.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ParisNice_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614014701\" alt=\"Paris-Nice\"><em>Image credit: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWpix</em></p>\n<p>As the name states, riders and teams will begin in France’s capital and finish on the Southern coast in Nice. ‘The Race to the Sun’, as the race is often called, signifies that the riders often are subject to harsh conditions in Northern France across the first few stages, before finishing in the sunshine on the Southern Coast.</p>\n<h4><strong>Route</strong></h4>\n<p>The race features eight stages, with a mixture of flat terrain, mountains, time-trials, and everything in between. The first day is full of short climbs on a circuit around Saint-Cyr-l'École, whilst stage two is the first clear opportunity for the sprinters. Stage three around Gien is the only time-trial on this year’s route. At only 14km, it is not the longest but requires the GC-favourites to be on-form. Pippo Ganna will not be present in France, so there will be a chance for someone else to win the stage, too!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PNS1fr_1024x1024.png?v=1614015367\" alt=\"Stage 1 of Paris-Nice 2021 \"><em>Stage 1 of Paris-Nice 2021 (Image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Stage four is a brutal day to Chiroubles with over 3500 metres of climbing. T<span>he riders finish atop a climb of 7.7km @ 5.5%. After a flat day on stage five, stage six features one of the longest climbs of the race: the Col du Ferrier. </span>The climb takes place mid-way through the stage which finishes in Biot. Stage seven is the queen stage and finishes atop the Valdeblore La Colmiane (16.3km @ 6.2%), whilst the final stage is the typical stage in and around Nice, featuring an array of famous climbs including Col d’Eze.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PNS1_1024x1024.png?v=1614015396\" alt=\"Stage 8 of Paris-Nice 2021 \"><em>Stage 8 of Paris-Nice 2021 (Image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Contenders</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Primoz_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614015434\" alt=\"Primoz Roglic\"></strong><em>Primoz Roglic in the yellow jersey at the 2020 Tour de France (Image credit: Alex Whitehead/SWpix)</em></p>\n<p>Maxi Schachmann is the reigning winner of Paris-Nice. He won stage one last year and held the yellow jersey for the entire race, despite showing some weakness on the Valdeblore La Colmiane. The German returns this year and the presence of a time-trial and plenty of short hills will give him a chance of going back-to-back.</p>\n<p>However, there is one stand-out favourite in France. This is Primoz Roglic’s first appearance at Paris-Nice and he will be making his season debut at the race this year. The last time we saw Roglic in a bike race, he was riding to victory at the Vuelta Espana, just holding off Richard Carapaz’ late surge. If Roglic is on form, he will be <em>very</em> difficult to beat.</p>\n<p>As ever, the INEOS Grenadiers enter the race with a strong team. Richie Porte and Tao Geoghegan Hart could lead the British outfit, both riders achieved a Grand Tour podium last season.</p>\n<p>Thibaut Pinot announced that he will be riding the Giro d’Italia instead of the Tour de France later in the year, therefore, David Gaudu will lead Groupama-FDJ at the 2021 Tour de France. The Frenchman will continue to prepare for the race in France at Paris-Nice. He ended 2020 in fine form when he claimed two stage wins at the Vuelta a España and is improving every season. If that continues, he could threaten here.</p>\n<p>Jai Hindley was runner-up to Tao Geoghegan Hart at the Giro last year in a nail-biting finish. He will kick-off his 2021 campaign at Paris-Nice with renewed expectations: one of the strongest climbers in the peloton. The time-trial will hamper him, though he still should be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites: </strong>Primož Roglič</p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders: </strong>David Gaudu, Alex Vlasov, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Jai Hindley, Wout Poels</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Tirreno-Adriatico </strong><b>- 2.WT (20/03)</b>\n</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tirreno-adriatico-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Read our full Tirreno-Adriatico preview</em></strong></a></p>\n<p><span>Taking place in Italy, Tirreno-Adriatico is a WorldTour stage-race usually raced in March. The event occurs between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas, therefore, Tirreno is often known as “The Race of the Two Seas”.</span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>The 2020 edition was postponed due to the global pandemic meaning the race took place in September, just ahead of the Giro d’Italia which was also delayed. It was a British one-two on that occasion with Simon Yates and Geraint Thomas ahead of Rafal Majka in third. </span></p>\n<p><span>The winner of the race is handed a large trident as a trophy. This is in relation to Neptune, the God of the Seas, an ode to the race’s sea-to-sea format.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032486-034_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614614146\" alt=\"Simon Yates\"><em>Simon Yates holding the trident trophy after winning Tirreno-Adriatico 2020 </em></span><em><span>(Image credit: Robert Bettini/Cor Vos)</span></em></p>\n<h4><span>Route</span></h4>\n<p><span>The first stage of the race starts and ends in Lido di Camaiore. Despite three short climbs early on in the stage it is mostly flat and will be a sprint-finish. Stage two is over 225km in length and features the first uphill finish of the race to Chiusdino, a climb of 7.6km and 3.5%. Stage three, although also uphill to the line, is not quite as testing so could be won by a sprinter or puncher.</span></p>\n<p><span>Stage four is undoubdtedly the queen stage in Italy. The riders first must conquer the Passo Caponelle (12.7km @ 4.6%), before running downhill to the foot of the Prati di Tivo. The race then heads up the climb for 15 kilometres at a gradient of 7%. This is the notable opportunity for the climbers to assert their dominance in the general classification.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Stage4_1024x1024.png?v=1614614216\" alt=\"Stage 4 Tirreno Adriatico\"></span></p>\n<p><i><span>Stage 4 of Tirreno-Adriatico 2021 (Credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Although stage four will serve the first major GC shake-up, stage five could well disrupt the field further. The riders will start in Castellalto before travelling up the coast of the Adriatic Sea. A finishing circuit in and around Castelfidardo is where the action will transpire. The main climb around the circuit, which will be taken on four occasions, is 1.6km @ 9.1% — short yet very, very steep. Anyone who has lost time to this point may look to blow up the stage early.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Stage5_1024x1024.png?v=1614614245\" alt=\"Stage 5 Tirreno Adriatico 2021\"></span></p>\n<p><i><span>Stage 5 of Tirreno-Adriatico 2021 (Credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Stage six includes just 1,600 vertical climbing meters, therefore a mass-sprint is the most likely outcome. Stage seven is the final stage and the only time-trial at Tirreno in 2021. Although only 11km, this could well swing the tide in the GC.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Contenders</span></h4>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/WVA_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614614302\" alt=\"Thibaut Pinot \"></span><i><span>(Image credit: ASO/Alex Broadway/SWPix)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Tirreno-Adriatico is generally the first chance to see the Giro d’Italia contenders go up against one another. Tao Geoghegan Hart, the winner of the maglia rosa last year, will instead head to the Tour de France and therefore will not be at Tirreno either. Despite that, we will see a multitude of strong contenders on the startline.</span></p>\n<p><span>The INEOS Grenadiers will arrive at both Tirreno and the Giro with Egan Bernal acting as their prime protagonist, backed-up by the very talented Pavel Sivakov. Bernal has started 2021 in impressive form highlighted by his podium at Strade Bianche. Filippo Ganna also starts for the Grenadiers, he will attempt to win yet another time-trial on stage seven — it would be his ninth in a row.</span></p>\n<p><span>Simon Yates won Tirreno-Adriatico last season and returns this year. This put him in good stead to challenge for the Giro d’Italia, however, a positive COVID-test put pay to his chances. Nonetheless, Yates is one of the best pure climbers in the world when on-form and will again enter as one of the major favourites to win the trident and blue jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span>After a dismal 2020 Tour de France, Thibaut Pinot has instead turned his head to the Italian races for 2021. His calendar is headlined by the Giro d’Italia and Tirreno-Adriatico. Pinot slowly worked his way into the season at the Tour des Alpes Maritimes et du Var where he acted as a domestique throughout. But Pinot will be keen to demonstrate improved form ahead of the Giro. There is no better place to do so than Tirreno.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tadej Pogačar </span><span>is set to ride Tirreno-Adriatico for the first time in his budding career. The reigning Tour de France champ, although returning to the Tour instead of the Giro, has already displayed fantastic form this season when he won the UAE Tour and finished seventh at Strade Bianche. He starts as a favourite with Rafal Majka and Davide Formolo riding in support.</span></p>\n<p><span>The World Champion also starts in Italy. Whether Julian Alaphiliippe will go for the overall classification or not is questionable, but one thing can be certain — he will be one of the most active riders in the race. The stage four climb on the Prati di Tivo is the big question mark for the Frenchman, though his effort on Mont Ventoux at the Tour de la Provence says otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><span>We wait for news on Remco Evenepoel, who has returned to regular training riders after crashing at Il Lombardia last season. He still plans on being in shape to challenge for the Giro.</span></p>\n<p><span>After making his season debut at Strade Bianche, Wout Van Aert now has a genuine chance of winning Tirreno-Adriatico. Without Roglic, Kuss or Kruijswijk on the startline, WVA will be let off the leash to either chase stage wins or make a run at the GC. He’d have liked a longer time-trial, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a contender. His young teammate Tobias Foss could also be one to watch.</span></p>\n<p><span>After his ludicrous win at Strade Bianche, we can't avoid mentioning Mathieu van der Poel. The GC will likely be too difficult for VDP mainly due to the Prati di Tivo, but the Dutch champion will set the race alight. He is in stunning form and has won on 50% of his racedays in 2021 thus far.</span></p>\n<p><span>The strength in quality at Tirreno-Adriatico this year is bewildering. Other riders that could well have a chance include Jakob Fuglsang, Mikel Landa, Emanuel Buchmann, Vincenzo Nibali and two-time winner Nairo Quintana.</span></p>\n<p><b>Favourites:<span> </span></b><span>Egan Bernal, Tadej Pogacar, Simon Yates</span></p>\n<p><b>Outsiders</b><span>: Pavel Sivakov, Wout van Aert, Emanuel Buchmann, Tobias Foss</span></p>\n<h4><span>Prediction</span></h4>\n<p><span>Following an impressive performance at Strade Bianche we expect Egan Bernal to win overall at Tirreno-Adriatico, which he will clinch on the Prati di Tivo. Bernal is in great shape and will be eager to assert himself against many of his Giro d'Italia rivals.</span></p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Milan-San Remo </strong><b>- 1.WT (20/03)</b>\n</h4>\n<p>The monuments have arrived!</p>\n<p>We have made it to the first of cycling’s five monuments, Milan-San Remo. ‘La Classicissima’, is a historic race with 111 editions, where Eddy Merckx holds the record for the most all-time wins with an astonishing seven to his name. The race is famous for its length – 300km makes it one of the longest days in the saddle for the riders.</p>\n<p>The 2020 edition was won by Wout Van Aert, who claimed the first monument of his career when he defeated Julian Alaphilippe in a sprint. The duo went clear of the bunch on the Poggio and were able to hold their lead until the finish.</p>\n<p>The course has been altered this year due to a landslide on the Passo del Turchino, meaning the peloton will take on the Colle di Giovo instead earlier in the day. Nonetheless, the heart-racing finale remains. The Cipressa (5.5km @ 4.1%) is the first obstacle of note, which comes at kilometre 277. The tempo will no doubt be ramped up here, as the offensive teams look to put the sprinters in to the red zone.</p>\n<p>Following a descent and short flat section, the famous Poggio (3.5km @ 3.8%) comes at kilometre 293. On its own it isn’t the most strenuous of climbs, but with a leg-sapping 290km in the legs and the punchers desperate to escape the clutches of the sprinters, this climb is as challenging as they come.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/msr_1024x1024.png?v=1613668749\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021\"></p>\n<p><em>Milan-San Remo profile 2021 (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>The finish in Milan-San Remo has been designed with consideration — it provides both the sprinters and the attackers a chance to win in almost equal measure. As of late, it has been the punchers that have come out on top — Arnaud Démare was the last pure sprinter to win, crossing the line first in 2016.</p>\n<p>If a sprinter is to win the 112<sup>th</sup> Milan-San Remo, Demare is as good a bet as any. He showed he can still climb well when he claimed stage 7 of the Giro d’Italia to Matera last year.</p>\n<p>Peter Sagan is set to start in Italy again this year. The Slovak seems to suit the terrain in Italy without flaw, but he has never managed to come out on top despite six(!) top-five finishes. As always, he will be among the key favourites.</p>\n<p>Giacomo Nizzolo and Davide Ballerini have both started 2021 in great form, winning at the Clásica de Almería and Tour de la Provence respectively. Both riders have proven they can resist when riding up climbs and are clearly in great shape this year. Riding on home soil, do not rule either rider out.</p>\n<p>Caleb Ewan, Sam Bennett and Pascal Ackermann are pure sprinters who should do well if they are in the front group for the finale. Whether they can withstand the attacks on the Poggio is their question mark.</p>\n<p>As ever, Julian Alaphilippe will be doing his utmost to cause havoc for the fast men and everyone else in the race. It’s inevitable that the world champion will attack on the Poggio and do his best to go to the line either solo or in a reduced group.</p>\n<p>One of the breakout stars of 2020 is set to start at MSR for the second time in his career — Marc Hirschi. He seems to have similar qualities to Alaphilippe, which he displayed at the Tour de France and in the World Championships last season. He has a great burst in the finish and is a confident descender — an ability which will be beneficial on the Poggio.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel made his debut at San Remo last season and managed 13<sup>th</sup> place. The Dutchman will enter the race as a hot favourite this season – the Poggio climb should suit him. If he can make his way into an elite group, his sprint may help him earn the second monument of his career after winning the Tour of Flanders last season.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Peter Sagan, Wout Van Aert, Marc Hirschi, Mathieu van der Poel, Julian Alaphilippe</p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Davide Ballerini, Giacomo Nizzolo, Matej Mohorič</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Giro d'Italia </strong><b>- 2.WT (08/05 - 30/05)</b>\n</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/giro-ditalia-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Read our full Giro d'Italia preview</em></strong></a></p>\n<p><span>The Giro d'italia is the first of the three Grand Tours in the 2021 cycling season. </span></p>\n<p>Known for its steep, demanding climbs, the 2021 route looks set to provide an enthralling spectacle.</p>\n<p>The 2021 Giro was peculiar for a number of reasons. Usually taking place in May, the race was postponed until October. This made it challenging for riders attempting to complete the Tour-Giro double as they'd be forced to ride them in quick succession. The Vuelta a España also overlapped with the Giro, making it impossible to ride 100% of both races.</p>\n<p>As the world attempts to return to normality, the cycling calendar does the same. This means that the Giro has been restored to it’s normal slot in May, two months prior to the Tour.</p>\n<p>The race for the maglia rosa also made 2020 an atypical edition. Geraint Thomas, Simon Yates, Jakob Fuglsang and Vincenzo Nibali were the pre-race favourites, but Thomas crashed out early whilst Yates contracted COVID-19, meaning the 1-2 from Tirreno-Adriatico were out. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tirreno-adriatico-2021-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong>Related – Tirreno-Adriatico 2021 Preview</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>In Remco Evenepoel’ s absence, João Almeida filled his shoes with flying colours. The Portuguese man quickly became a star. He held the maglia rosa between stages three and eighteen before battling on to finish fourth in his first Grand Tour.<span> </span><span>Tao Geoghegan Hart </span>filled the void left by Geraint Thomas to go clear on the Passo dello Stelvio alongside the Team Sunweb duo of Wilco Kelderman and Jai Hindley — the three riders were separated by 15 seconds  in the GC with three stages remaining. </p>\n<p><span>Kelderman fell away, though, and Geoghegan Hart was distinctly stronger than Hindley in the final time-trial into Milan, catapulting the Brit to a sensational victory which could never have been foreseen.</span></p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032639-083_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614857757\" alt=\"Tao Geoghegan Hart\"></span></i><i><span>(Image credit: </span></i><i><span>LB/RB/Cor Vos</span></i><i><span>)</span></i></p>\n<h4><strong>Route</strong></h4>\n<p><span>The Giro d’Italia is known to include a multitude of steep climbs and hilly roads throughout, whilst also including some flat stages to tempt some of the world's strongest sprinters to join the fun.</span></p>\n<p><span>The 2021 Giro kicks-off in Turin with a 9km flat time-trial — Filippo Ganna territory. Stages two and three could be for the sprinters, but stage three does have some short but sharp ramps, perhaps suiting the likes of Peter Sagan more than the pure sprinters who struggle more going uphill.</span></p>\n<p><span>Stage four is the first of the mountain stages and features 3000 metres of climbing to Sestola. A pancake-flat stage five follows before another mountain stage on stage six. Here, we find the longest climb of the race thus far (15.5km @ 6%) before the stage finishes in Ascoli Piceno. A fourth opportunity for the sprinters lies on stage seven to round out the first week.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage4_c2c81722-a9ab-42e4-9609-0003e946095b_1024x1024.png?v=1614857823\" alt=\"Stage 4 Giro d'Italia 2021\"></span><i><span>Stage 4 of the Giro d’Italia 2021 (image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p>Week two gets underway with 3000+ metres of climbing — commonplace on this year’s route. The final climb isn’t the most strenuous in the race, though at 5.3km and 6.7%, those targeting pink must stay focused. Stage nine is no easier and has the potential to be a thrilling stage. Climbs are scattered throughout and coming in at under 160km, the stage could be ridden in an attacking fashion. This is particularly the case as stage 10 is the next opportunity for the sprinters, which will in-turn be followed by a rest-day.</p>\n<p>To this point, numerous up-hill finishes would’ve taken place, but none of them come close to the queen-stage. This means that we could see a tight general classification entering the first rest-day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage9_1024x1024.png?v=1614857878\" alt=\"Stage 9 Giro d'Italia 2021\"><i><span>Stage 9 of the Giro d’Italia 2021 (image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p>Stage 11 could be one of the most exciting at this year’s Giro d'Italia. Starting in Perugia, the peloton will head west into Tuscany before riding some of the gravelled roads that are raced at Strade Bianche. This is one of the must-see stages, anything could happen. Stage 12 begins in Siena and the mountains return. Over 4,000 metres will be climbed here as the stage difficulty ramps up. The Passo della Consuma (15.1km @ 6.1% ) and the Passo della Calla (16.1km @ 5.3%) are long, gruelling efforts which also feature steeper pitches. Again, the following stage could enable more attacks and general explosiveness as stage 13 is the very definition of flat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage12_1024x1024.png?v=1614857915\" alt=\"Stage 12 Giro d'italia 2021\"><i><span>Stage 12 of the Giro d’Italia 2021 (image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p>This won’t last, though. Stage 14 will display who is capable of winning the maglia rosa, as the revered Monte Zoncolan awaits. At 13.3km and 8.9%, the Zoncolan will be ruthless. It has been used on six occasions since 2000, most recently in 2018. Chris Froome won that day ahead of Simon Yates and the top-10 were spread across almost two minutes. Expect the group of favourites to shatter in a similar fashion this year.</p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Stage14_1024x1024.png?v=1614857958\" alt=\"Monte Zoncolan, stage 14 Giro 2021\"></span></i><i><span>Stage 14 finishes on Monte Zoncolan, Giro d’Italia 2021 (image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Stage 15 to Gorizia is much less complex. A breakaway win is feasible and if not, a day for any of the sprinters that survived Zoncolan is on the menu. Stage 16 is the final stage before the second rest-day and the riders will need it</span>. 210km and well-over 5000 metres of climbing awaits, featuring multiple iconic mountains including the Passo Fedaia (13.6km @ 7.6%), Passo Pordoi (11.9km @ 6.6%) and the Passo Giau (9.8km @ 9.3%). The peloton then run downhill to the finish in Cortina d’Ampezzo — the hosts of the Alpine Ski World Championships in February earlier this year.</p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage16_1024x1024.png?v=1614858011\" alt=\"Stage 16 Giro d'Italia 2021\"></span></i><i><span>Stage 16, the queen stage of the Giro d’Italia 2021 (image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p>The queen stage may have been completed, but there are still opportunities aplenty for the GC contenders to take time on their rivals. The peloton must tackle the Passo San Valentino (15.1km @ 7.6%) on stage 17 before finishing on the Sega di Ala (11.6km @ 9.5%). Anyone not feeling well-rested will suffer. Next up, the longest stage of the 2021 Giro d’Italia. Stage 18 is flat for 200km before a series of short hills in the final 30km could shake things up.</p>\n<p>Stage 19 is another test for the GC riders and features a mountain-top-finish on the Alpe di Mera (9.6km @ 9.1%). The most difficult test in the final week comes on stage 20, though. Although the stage doesn’t finish here, the Passo san Bernardino (23km @ 6.3%) will put any strugglers to the sword. The stage ends on the Alpe Motta, a climb of 7.4km @ 8.5%, just kilometres from the Swiss-Italian border.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage20_1024x1024.png?v=1614858039\" alt=\"Stage 20 Giro d'italia\"></p>\n<p><i><span>Stage 20 of the Giro d’Italia 2021 (image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>The climbs may be done and dusted but the GC riders must stay strong for one final day. A 29.5km individual time-trial to the centre of Milan could prove decisive in the chase for pink. After all, the pink jersey changed hands in the stage 21 time-trial last year.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p> <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20200827TDF0034-A.S.O._Alex_Broadway_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614858430\" alt=\"Egan Bernal\"><i><span>Image credit: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWPix</span></i></p>\n<p><span>The Giro d’Italia has a riveting startlist this season. The route features less time-trial kilometres than the Tour de France which means many of the strongest climbers in the world have turned their focus to Italy instead</span><span> of the Tour. Perhaps the anticipated domination of </span><span>Tadej Pogačar </span><span>and Primož Roglič</span><span> in France is also a factor. </span></p>\n<p><span>Tao Geoghegan Hart</span><span>, the reigning Giro champ, will not return this season. Instead, he looks to help INEOS at the Tour de France. The Grenadiers remain key protagonists, though. Egan Bernal will ride the Giro d'Italia for the first time in his career, and although he has stated that he is still struggling with back pain, his Tour de la Provence form suggests he is on strong from. The winner of the 2019 Tour is one of the premier favourites. Pavel Sivakov also joins the Grenadier squad and we expect to see further progression from the Russian this season. He is very talented and could take the reins should Bernal struggle. Filippo Ganna will look to win the two time-trials and help the team elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p><span>Thibaut Pinot heads to Italy as one of the favourites. It’s been a difficult period in Thibaut’s career. After winning on the Tourmalet at the 2019 Tour, his subsequent withdrawal was a hammer-blow when he looked to be in the form of his life. He also struggled at the Tour last year after a crash on stage one. Since Thibaut achieved a podium at the Tour in 2014 he hasn’t been dealt a good hand. Something often seems to go wrong, whether it be a crash, illness, or losing time in crosswinds. He changes things up this year to focus on the Giro, where he could do with some good luck.</span></p>\n<p><span>Astana have a great chance led by emerging Russian talent Alex Vlasov. He did well at the Vuelta last year after an impressive inaugural season at WorldTour level. Vlasov has proven to be one of the most exciting young climbers in the world, proven by his win on Mont Ventoux last Summer.</span></p>\n<p><span>Deceuninck-Quck-Step are an interesting proposition. Remco Evenepoel crashed out heavily at Il Lombardia last year and hasn’t raced since. Should the Belgian prodigy be able to race at this year he could be the out-and-out favourite. He started four stage-races in 2020, winning all four and defeating riders such as Jakob Fuglsang, Mikel Landa and Miguel Angel Lopez. His fitness is questionable though after a lengthy lay-off. We wait to see whether he is able to race and what type of form he is in.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032316-009_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614869556\" alt=\"Remco Evenepoel \"><em>Remco Evenepoel (Image credit: Luis Gomez/Cor Vos)</em></span></p>\n<p><span>Mikel Landa returns to the Giro this year, he finished fourth in 2019. The Spaniard is one of the strongest pure climbers in the world and cannot be underestimated, despite his inevitable loss in the two time-trials. He is backed up by Pello Bilbao who finished in the top-5 at the Giro last season himself.</span></p>\n<p><span>Emanuel Buchmann had a year to forget in 2020 after a crash at the Dauphine meant he was unable to perform at his best. The German had been improving every year and achieved fourth at the 2019 Tour de France overall. Buchmann has never ridden the Giro before and his debut in Italy could result in challenge for pink.</span></p>\n<p><span>Simon Yates returns to the Giro again this year after being forced to withdraw at his last attempt. The Brit is searching for his second Grand Tour win after winning the Vuelta in 2019. We know that both Yates bros are among the best in the world when the road goes uphill, meaning if Yates is on-form, he is a leading contender.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another Brit looking to challenge overall is Hugh Carthy of EF Education-NIPPO. Carthy demonstrated elite climbing and time-trialling legs at the Vuelta in 2020, earning a place on the final podium. This was by far Carthy’s best result of his career yet, and at 26-years-old. We expect Carthy can still improve further as he gains experience racing directly against the finest cyclists around.</span></p>\n<p><span>Trek-Segafredo are expected to arrive in Turin with Vincenzo Nibali and Bauke Mollema as their dual leaders. ‘El Squalo’ would’ve been disappointed with 7th overall at last year’s Giro, can he bounce back at 36 years old? On the other hand, Bauke Mollema has started 2021 in exceptional form. First he won a stage at the Tour des Alpes, then the Trofeo Laigueglia. He could be going under the radar.</span></p>\n<p><span>Outsiders for the GC include Romain Bardet, Clement Champoussin, Tobias Foss, Brandon McNulty and Marc Soler.</span></p>\n<p><span>The sprinters are headlined by Caleb Ewan. The Australian set an ambitious goal of winning a stage at every Grand Tour in 2021. If he wins one early in the race, it’s unlikely we’ll see Ewan make it all the way to Milan.</span></p>\n<p><span>Peter Sagan will also be racing. He may not be the quickest man in the peloton, but the stages with enough meters uphill to drop the pure sprinters are perfect for the Slovak. </span></p>\n<p><span>Fernando Gaviria, Giacomo Nizzolo and Elia Viviani are all very capable sprinters who will be the biggest threats to Caleb Ewan.</span></p>\n<p><span>The newest sprinter on the block is David Dekker. The 23-year-old impressed early on in 2021 at the UAE Tour where he achieved two second-place finishes at his first WorldTour race. We are not certain just how good Dekker is yet, but he is definitely one to watch.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover photo: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWPix.com</span></em></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-UFKPji\"></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"c6c72b38af84b0572cdce5e2d82ce86761f0eae1b909518f9332e9783c8f12c6","category":"Cycling"}
