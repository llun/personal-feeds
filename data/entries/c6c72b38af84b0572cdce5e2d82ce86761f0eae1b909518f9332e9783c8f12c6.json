The race takes place in central Italy, just south of Firenze in Tuscan hills, making for a sumptuous setting.</p>\n<p>The riders will take on over 3000 metres of climbing throughout the day, which is incredible because there are few climbs longer than one kilometre in length! Constant short hills and descents await the competition, making this a race of attrition. Strade Bianche is unique in the sense that gravel roads are scattered throughout, a rare sight in a road race. The winner must be strong in many senses if they are to cross the line victorious in the Sienna.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Strade_1024x1024.png?v=1613667985\" alt=\"Strade Bianche\"></p>\n<p><em>Strade Bianche, 2021 profile (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Only 42 of the 166 starters finished the race in 2020, displaying Strade’s brutality to perfection. Wout Van Aert won solo in Sienna that day after attacking with 12km to go, dropping Davide Formolo and Maxi Schachmann, who both finished on the podium.</p>\n<p>It was Van Aert’s first of six victories in 2020 on the road. He will kick-off his 2021 season in Italy as he looks to make it back-to-back victories on the famous white Italian roads. He perhaps starts as the out-and-out favourite, as ever, though, the competition is stellar.</p>\n<p>2019 winner Julian Alaphilippe is back at Strade after missing the race in 2020. Deceuninck have a strong line-up in Italy, where 2015 winner Zdeněk Štybar will join Alaphilippe. The Czech man has wracked up a series of impressive results here — since his win in 2015 he has finished in the top-10 every year.</p>\n<p>Jakob Fuglsang is a man to be reckoned with in the classics. He was just beaten to the line by Alaphilippe in 2019 and finished in the top-5 last year. Although he has never won the race, Fuglsang will start as a premier contender.</p>\n<p>UAE-Team Emirates finished second last year with Davide Formolo, and clearly have intentions of going one better this year, bringing Marc Hirschi and Tadej Pogačar to join up with Formolo in Italy. We know Formolo can go well here, and although Hirschi and Pogačar have never finished in the top-10, the race should suit them.</p>\n<p>Tim Wellens is a rider that always starts the season well and proved that again this year by winning a stage and the overall classification at Étoile de Bessèges. He has only ridden Strade twice but finished in the top-10 on both occasions, including a podium finish in 2017.</p>\n<p>Strade Bianche is one race that Greg Van Avermaet is yet to conquer in his illustrious career. He finished second in 2015 and 2017, beaten by Štybar and Kwiatkwoski respectively. After finishing eighth in 2020, GVA will look to put that record straight with his new team AG2R Citroën.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, one more rider we must mention, Mathieu van der Poel – heard of him? He only managed 15<sup>th</sup> last year in his first appearance at the race, but the gravelled, hilly roads should suit his style. He will be disappointed not to improve on that result this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Jakob Fuglsang, Julian Alaphilippe, Wout Van Aert, Zdeněk Štybar, Tim Wellens</p>\n<p><strong>Dark horses:</strong> Tom Pidcock, Matej Mohorič, Søren Kragh Andersen, Quinn Simmons</p>\n<h4><strong>Paris–Nice - 2.WT (07/03-14/03)</strong></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-nice-2021-preview\"><strong><em>Read our full Paris-Nice preview</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>Paris-Nice is the inaugural European WorldTour stage race of the season.</p>\n<p>Raced across eight days, Paris-Nice holds great prestige in cycling — the first edition took place in 1933. Sean Kelly gained legendary-status at Paris-Nice when he won seven years in a row from 1982-1988.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/ParisNice_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614014701\" alt=\"Paris-Nice\"><em>Image credit: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWpix</em></p>\n<p>As the name states, riders and teams will begin in France’s capital and finish on the Southern coast in Nice. ‘The Race to the Sun’, as the race is often called, signifies that the riders often are subject to harsh conditions in Northern France across the first few stages, before finishing in the sunshine on the Southern Coast.</p>\n<h4><strong>Route</strong></h4>\n<p>The race features eight stages, with a mixture of flat terrain, mountains, time-trials, and everything in between. The first day is full of short climbs on a circuit around Saint-Cyr-l'École, whilst stage two is the first clear opportunity for the sprinters. Stage three around Gien is the only time-trial on this year’s route. At only 14km, it is not the longest but requires the GC-favourites to be on-form. Pippo Ganna will not be present in France, so there will be a chance for someone else to win the stage, too!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PNS1fr_1024x1024.png?v=1614015367\" alt=\"Stage 1 of Paris-Nice 2021 \"><em>Stage 1 of Paris-Nice 2021 (Image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Stage four is a brutal day to Chiroubles with over 3500 metres of climbing. T<span>he riders finish atop a climb of 7.7km @ 5.5%. After a flat day on stage five, stage six features one of the longest climbs of the race: the Col du Ferrier. </span>The climb takes place mid-way through the stage which finishes in Biot. Stage seven is the queen stage and finishes atop the Valdeblore La Colmiane (16.3km @ 6.2%), whilst the final stage is the typical stage in and around Nice, featuring an array of famous climbs including Col d’Eze.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PNS1_1024x1024.png?v=1614015396\" alt=\"Stage 8 of Paris-Nice 2021 \"><em>Stage 8 of Paris-Nice 2021 (Image credit: La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<h4><strong>Contenders</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Primoz_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614015434\" alt=\"Primoz Roglic\"></strong><em>Primoz Roglic in the yellow jersey at the 2020 Tour de France (Image credit: Alex Whitehead/SWpix)</em></p>\n<p>Maxi Schachmann is the reigning winner of Paris-Nice. He won stage one last year and held the yellow jersey for the entire race, despite showing some weakness on the Valdeblore La Colmiane. The German returns this year and the presence of a time-trial and plenty of short hills will give him a chance of going back-to-back.</p>\n<p>However, there is one stand-out favourite in France. This is Primoz Roglic’s first appearance at Paris-Nice and he will be making his season debut at the race this year. The last time we saw Roglic in a bike race, he was riding to victory at the Vuelta Espana, just holding off Richard Carapaz’ late surge. If Roglic is on form, he will be <em>very</em> difficult to beat.</p>\n<p>As ever, the INEOS Grenadiers enter the race with a strong team. Richie Porte and Tao Geoghegan Hart could lead the British outfit, both riders achieved a Grand Tour podium last season.</p>\n<p>Thibaut Pinot announced that he will be riding the Giro d’Italia instead of the Tour de France later in the year, therefore, David Gaudu will lead Groupama-FDJ at the 2021 Tour de France. The Frenchman will continue to prepare for the race in France at Paris-Nice. He ended 2020 in fine form when he claimed two stage wins at the Vuelta a España and is improving every season. If that continues, he could threaten here.</p>\n<p>Jai Hindley was runner-up to Tao Geoghegan Hart at the Giro last year in a nail-biting finish. He will kick-off his 2021 campaign at Paris-Nice with renewed expectations: one of the strongest climbers in the peloton. The time-trial will hamper him, though he still should be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites: </strong>Primož Roglič</p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders: </strong>David Gaudu, Alex Vlasov, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Jai Hindley, Wout Poels</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Tirreno-Adriatico </strong><b>- 1.WT (20/03)</b>\n</h4>\n<p><strong><em>Read our full Tirreno-Adriatico preview</em></strong></p>\n<p><span>Taking place in Italy, Tirreno-Adriatico is a WorldTour stage-race usually raced in March. The event occurs between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic Seas, therefore, Tirreno is often known as “The Race of the Two Seas”.</span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>The 2020 edition was postponed due to the global pandemic meaning the race took place in September, just ahead of the Giro d’Italia which was also delayed. It was a British one-two on that occasion with Simon Yates and Geraint Thomas ahead of Rafal Majka in third. </span></p>\n<p><span>The winner of the race is handed a large trident as a trophy. This is in relation to Neptune, the God of the Seas, an ode to the race’s sea-to-sea format.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032486-034_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614614146\" alt=\"Simon Yates\"><em>Simon Yates holding the trident trophy after winning Tirreno-Adriatico 2020 </em></span><em><span>(Image credit: Robert Bettini/Cor Vos)</span></em></p>\n<h4><span>Route</span></h4>\n<p><span>The first stage of the race starts and ends in Lido di Camaiore. Despite three short climbs early on in the stage it is mostly flat and will be a sprint-finish. Stage two is over 225km in length and features the first uphill finish of the race to Chiusdino, a climb of 7.6km and 3.5%. Stage three, although also uphill to the line, is not quite as testing so could be won by a sprinter or puncher.</span></p>\n<p><span>Stage four is undoubdtedly the queen stage in Italy. The riders first must conquer the Passo Caponelle (12.7km @ 4.6%), before running downhill to the foot of the Prati di Tivo. The race then heads up the climb for 15 kilometres at a gradient of 7%. This is the notable opportunity for the climbers to assert their dominance in the general classification.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Stage4_1024x1024.png?v=1614614216\" alt=\"Stage 4 Tirreno Adriatico\"></span></p>\n<p><i><span>Stage 4 of Tirreno-Adriatico 2021 (Credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Although stage four will serve the first major GC shake-up, stage five could well disrupt the field further. The riders will start in Castellalto before travelling up the coast of the Adriatic Sea. A finishing circuit in and around Castelfidardo is where the action will transpire. The main climb around the circuit, which will be taken on four occasions, is 1.6km @ 9.1% — short yet very, very steep. Anyone who has lost time to this point may look to blow up the stage early.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Stage5_1024x1024.png?v=1614614245\" alt=\"Stage 5 Tirreno Adriatico 2021\"></span></p>\n<p><i><span>Stage 5 of Tirreno-Adriatico 2021 (Credit: La Flamme Rouge)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Stage six includes just 1,600 vertical climbing meters, therefore a mass-sprint is the most likely outcome. Stage seven is the final stage and the only time-trial at Tirreno in 2021. Although only 11km, this could well swing the tide in the GC.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Contenders</span></h4>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/WVA_1024x1024.jpg?v=1614614302\" alt=\"Thibaut Pinot \"></span><i><span>(Image credit: ASO/Alex Broadway/SWPix)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Tirreno-Adriatico is generally the first chance to see the Giro d’Italia contenders go up against one another. Tao Geoghegan Hart, the winner of the maglia rosa last year, will instead head to the Tour de France and therefore will not be at Tirreno either. Despite that, we will see a multitude of strong contenders on the startline.</span></p>\n<p><span>The INEOS Grenadiers will arrive at both Tirreno and the Giro with Egan Bernal acting as their prime protagonist, backed-up by the very talented Pavel Sivakov. Filippo Ganna also starts for the Grenadiers, he will attempt to win yet another time-trial on stage seven.</span></p>\n<p><span>Simon Yates won Tirreno-Adriatico last season and returns this year. This looked to put him in good stead to challenge for the Giro d’Italia, however, a positive COVID-test put pay to his chances. Nonetheless, Yates is one of the best pure climbers in the world when on-form and will again enter as one of the major favourites to win the trident and blue jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span>After a dismal 2020 Tour de France, Thibaut Pinot has instead turned his head to the Italian races for 2021. His calendar is headlined by the Giro d’Italia and Tirreno-Adriatico. Pinot slowly worked his way into the season at the Tour des Alpes Maritimes et du Var where he acted as a domestique throughout. But Pinot will be keen to demonstrate improved form ahead of the Giro. There is no better place to do so than Tirreno.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tadej Pogačar </span><span>is set to ride Tirreno-Adriatico for the first time in his budding career. The reigning Tour de France champ, although returning to the Tour instead of the Giro, has already displayed fantastic form this season when he won the UAE Tour. He starts as a favourite with Rafal Majka and Davide Formolo riding in support.</span></p>\n<p><span>The World Champion also starts in Italy. Whether Julian Alaphiliippe will look to go for the overall classification or not is questionable, but one thing can be certain — he will be one of the most active riders in the race. The stage four climb on the Prati di Tivo is the big question mark for the Frenchman, though his effort on Mont Ventoux at the Tour de la Provence says otherwise. We wait for news on Remco Evenepoel, who has returned to regular training riders after crashing at Il Lombardia last season. He still plans on being in-shape to challenge for the Giro.</span></p>\n<p><span>After making his season debut at Strade Bianche, Wout Van Aert now has a genuine chance of winning Tirreno-Adriatico. Without Roglic, Kuss or Kruijswijk on the startline, WVA will be let off the leash to either chase stage wins or make a run at the GC. He’d have liked a longer time-trial, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a contender. His young teammate Tobias Foss could also be one to watch.</span></p>\n<p><span>The strength in quality at Tirreno-Adriatico this year is bewildering. Other riders that could well have a chance include Jakob Fuglsang, Mikel Landa, Emanuel Buchmann, Vincenzo Nibali and two-time winner Nairo Quintana.</span></p>\n<p><b>Favourites:<span> </span></b><span>Egan Bernal, Tadej Pogacar, Simon Yates</span></p>\n<p><b>Outsiders</b><span>: Pavel Sivakov, Wout van Aert, Emanuel Buchmann, Tobias Foss</span></p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Milan-San Remo </strong><b>- 1.WT (20/03)</b>\n</h4>\n<p>The monuments have arrived!</p>\n<p>We have made it to the first of cycling’s five monuments, Milan-San Remo. ‘La Classicissima’, is a historic race with 111 editions, where Eddy Merckx holds the record for the most all-time wins with an astonishing seven to his name. The race is famous for its length – 300km makes it one of the longest days in the saddle for the riders.</p>\n<p>The 2020 edition was won by Wout Van Aert, who claimed the first monument of his career when he defeated Julian Alaphilippe in a sprint. The duo went clear of the bunch on the Poggio and were able to hold their lead until the finish.</p>\n<p>The course has been altered this year due to a landslide on the Passo del Turchino, meaning the peloton will take on the Colle di Giovo instead earlier in the day. Nonetheless, the heart-racing finale remains. The Cipressa (5.5km @ 4.1%) is the first obstacle of note, which comes at kilometre 277. The tempo will no doubt be ramped up here, as the offensive teams look to put the sprinters in to the red zone.</p>\n<p>Following a descent and short flat section, the famous Poggio (3.5km @ 3.8%) comes at kilometre 293. On its own it isn’t the most strenuous of climbs, but with a leg-sapping 290km in the legs and the punchers desperate to escape the clutches of the sprinters, this climb is as challenging as they come.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/msr_1024x1024.png?v=1613668749\" alt=\"Milan San Remo 2021\"></p>\n<p><em>Milan-San Remo profile 2021 (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>The finish in Milan-San Remo has been designed with consideration — it provides both the sprinters and the attackers a chance to win in almost equal measure. As of late, it has been the punchers that have come out on top — Arnaud Démare was the last pure sprinter to win, crossing the line first in 2016.</p>\n<p>If a sprinter is to win the 112<sup>th</sup> Milan-San Remo, Demare is as good a bet as any. He showed he can still climb well when he claimed stage 7 of the Giro d’Italia to Matera last year.</p>\n<p>Peter Sagan is set to start in Italy again this year. The Slovak seems to suit the terrain in Italy without flaw, but he has never managed to come out on top despite six(!) top-five finishes. As always, he will be among the key favourites.</p>\n<p>Giacomo Nizzolo and Davide Ballerini have both started 2021 in great form, winning at the Clásica de Almería and Tour de la Provence respectively. Both riders have proven they can resist when riding up climbs and are clearly in great shape this year. Riding on home soil, do not rule either rider out.</p>\n<p>Caleb Ewan, Sam Bennett and Pascal Ackermann are pure sprinters who should do well if they are in the front group for the finale. Whether they can withstand the attacks on the Poggio is their question mark.</p>\n<p>As ever, Julian Alaphilippe will be doing his utmost to cause havoc for the fast men and everyone else in the race. It’s inevitable that the world champion will attack on the Poggio and do his best to go to the line either solo or in a reduced group.</p>\n<p>One of the breakout stars of 2020 is set to start at MSR for the second time in his career — Marc Hirschi. He seems to have similar qualities to Alaphilippe, which he displayed at the Tour de France and in the World Championships last season. He has a great burst in the finish and is a confident descender — an ability which will be beneficial on the Poggio.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel made his debut at San Remo last season and managed 13<sup>th</sup> place. The Dutchman will enter the race as a hot favourite this season – the Poggio climb should suit him. If he can make his way into an elite group, his sprint may help him earn the second monument of his career after winning the Tour of Flanders last season.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Peter Sagan, Wout Van Aert, Marc Hirschi, Mathieu van der Poel, Julian Alaphilippe</p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Davide Ballerini, Giacomo Nizzolo, Matej Mohorič</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover photo: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWPix.com</span></em></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-UFKPji\"></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"c6c72b38af84b0572cdce5e2d82ce86761f0eae1b909518f9332e9783c8f12c6","category":"Cycling"}
