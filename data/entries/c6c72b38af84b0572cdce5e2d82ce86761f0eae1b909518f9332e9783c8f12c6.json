It was the first 1.1 category race to go ahead this season. So, with many races looking likely to follow, here is our guide to the early season races in 2021.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-womens-2021-early-season-a-guide\">Related – The Women's Early Season Guide 2021</a><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/seven-women-s-cycling-races-to-watch-in-2021\"><br>Related – The Women's Cycling Races to Watch<br></a></strong></em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/worldtour-cycling-team-jerseys-2021\"><em><strong>Related – The WorldTour team kits 2021</strong></em></a></p>\n<h4>\n<b>Etoile de </b><b>Bessèges</b><b> - 2.1 (03/02-07/02)</b>\n</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A five-day stage race in and around the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bessèges</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> region in Southern France which closely follows the Grand Prix Marseillaise. The startlist often features many that were present in Marseille and is usually dominated by French teams – although that is set to change in 2021. Due to the cancellation and postponement of other races, 12 WorldTour teams are on the startline, including the INEOS Grenadiers, Trek-Segafredo and BORA-hansgrohe. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first stages suit the punchers and sprinters, but the final stage is a short individual time-trial to Alès. With a lack of large climbs throughout, the time-trial is often critical in deciding the final winner. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benoît Cosnefroy</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> won in 2020 after winning in Marseillaise too. He’ll miss the event this time due to continued knee pain. Among the favourites are Alberto Bettiol, Tim Wellens, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Felix Großschartner</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <span>Michał Kwiatkowski</span>. Egan Bernal is also set to start his first race since dropping out of the Tour de France last year.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Tour de la Provence - 2.Pro (11/02-07/02)</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Mollema_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612202921\" alt=\"Bauke Mollema\"></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bauke Mollema could be a favourite for the Tour de la Provence (Image credit: </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CorVos/SWpix.com</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early season calendar in France doesn’t slow down, with just three days between Etoile de </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bessèges and the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Tour de la Provence. This time, we are stepping up to the .Pro category which is just below WorldTour. Although the teams remain in Southern France, just North of Marseille, the roadbook looks very different due to the inaugural mountain-top finish of the season. Stage three finishes on Mount Ventoux, although not at the peak, the riders will finish at Chalet Reynard, a climb of 9.7km at 9.1%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nairo Quintana won the race last year after taking almost 90 seconds on Chalet Reynard. Quintana doesn’t line up this season, but a pure climber is likely to win overall. Alex Vlasov, Bauke Mollema and perhaps Marseillaise winner </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aurélien Paret-Peintre</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are among the favourites.</span></p>\n<h4>\n<b>Clásica de Almería</b><b> - 1.Pro (14/02)</b>\n</h4>\n<p>The first .Pro one-day classic is set to take place in Spain with the Clásica de Almería after being promoted from a 1.1 to 1.Pro category race in 2020. The race features around 1,500m of climbing, much of which is on shorter hills earlier in the day, meaning a bunch sprint is the most likely outcome.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/download_1_1024x1024.png?v=1613665316\" alt=\"Clásica de Almería \"></p>\n<p><em>Clásica de Almería (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Pascal Ackermann won in both 2019 and 2020 for BORA-hansgrohe but will not be on the startline in 2021 so there will be no hat-trick for the German. Instead, Fernando Gaviria, Giacomo Nizzolo and Matteo Moschetti will start as the favourites.</p>\n<p>Of the three, it is Nizzolo who has enjoyed better form as of late, he won the Italian Road Race as well as the European Championships last season. On their day, both Gaviria and Moschetti are very quick, but they have struggled for various reasons over the past twelve months.</p>\n<p>The race is also notable as we will see Mark Cavendish realise his second stint with Deceuninck-Quick-Step with his first raceday of the season. He could be riding for Álvaro Hodeg, nonetheless, it will be gratifying to see the Manx Missile back in action.</p>\n<h4>\n<b>Tour du Haut Var </b><b>- 2.1 (19/02-21/02)</b>\n</h4>\n<p>France’s early-season stage-race fest continues with the Tour du Haut Var. Taking place Friday - Sunday, this long weekend will provide the riders with absolutely no time off. All three stages are demanding and littered with climbs.</p>\n<p>The first stage features short, uncategorised climbs in the first 110km, before three ascents of the Col de Gourdon (14km @ 3.9%). The climb doesn’t seem too punishign, but features a nasty pitch to the finish in the final kilometre where the punchers will excel.</p>\n<p>The second day features <em>just</em> 3000m of climbing, but another very steep finish to Fayence (1.2km, 9.8%), which will help the punchers succeed again.</p>\n<p>The final stage is short at 131km but do not be mistaken, it is brutal. The riders will face the Col Saint-Roch (5.8km @ 7.2%), followed by the Col de Braus (9.9km at 6.5%), then the Col de Castillon (6.2km @ 5.7%) with the Col de la Madone (11km at 6.9%) next. From here, the riders will descend into the finish in Blausasc, with the short Col de Nice the only interference.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/download_3_1024x1024.png?v=1613663243\" alt=\"TOUR DU HAUT VAR - Stage 3\"></p>\n<p><em>Stage three of the Tour du Haut Var (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>All three days are extremely difficult, with 10,000m climbing spread across the three days of racing. Nonetheless, the punchers are more suited to the first two stages and will look to take time here —even if only in the form of bonus seconds. However, the final day suits the pure climbers much more. This is where the GC could be decided as the stronger teams will likely blow up the race early on.</p>\n<p>Nairo Quintana continued his dominant early season form last year when he backed up his win at the Tour de la Provence with victory at the Tour du Haut Var. The diminutive Colombian missed the Tour de la Provence last week but will make his season debut here after an off-season crash setback his season.</p>\n<p>With Nairoman unlikely to be back to his best, the INEOS Grenadiers could benefit. Pavel Sivakov, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Rohan Dennis, Jhonatan Narváez and Geraint Thomas headline their imposing squad, whilst Tom Pidcock makes his Grenadier debut. An exceptional team with many options, we think Pavel Sivakov could take the lead.</p>\n<p>David Gaudu could be the man to watch for Groupama-FDJ as he begins his preparation for Paris-Nice and later, the Tour de France. Thibaut Pinot joins his younger teammate in France but has said he plans on acting as a domestique.</p>\n<p>The Israel Start-Up duo of Dan Martin and Mike Woods will enjoy the uphill finish on stage one and two, they could form a dangerous partnership in the overall.</p>\n<p>Jakob Fuglsang also starts his season for Astana-Premier Tech — the Dane plans on going for Olympic gold later this year — but will look at the parcours presented here with glee.</p>\n<p>Giulio Ciccone returned with vengeance at the Tour de la Provence, proving that he has well and truly shaken off his poor 2020 campaign. Without a time-trial, the Italian starts as a GC favourite, whilst Bauke Mollema is another great option for Trek-Segafredo.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Giulio Ciccone, Jakob Fuglsang, Pavel Sivakov, David Gaudu</p>\n<p><strong>Dark horses:</strong> Clément Champoussin, Xandro Meurisse, Simon Carr, Jesus Herrada, Jhonatan Narváez </p>\n<h4><b>UAE Tour - WT (21/02-27/02)</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Froome_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612202977\" alt=\"Chris Froome\"></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Froome is set to make his Israel Start Up Nation debut at the UAE Tour. (Image credit: </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alex Broadway/ASO/SWpix.com</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></i></p>\n<p>The UAE Tour is the first on the WorldTour calendar in 2021 after the Santos Tour Down Under was cancelled due to the global pandemic. This means we will see a supercharged startlist, with the likes of Chris Froome and Tadej Pogačar in attendance.</p>\n<p>The 2021 route features an individual time-trial for the first time since 2018, which takes place on stage two around Hudayriat Island. 13 kilometres in length, it will be the first chance for the GC challengers to gain time. Filippo Ganna will attempt to win his eighth time-trial in a row, a streak which runs back to the Italian National Championships last August. Certainties do not exist in cycling, but if they did, Ganna will win stage two!</p>\n<p>The climbs to Jebel Hafeet on stage three (10.6km @ 6.8%) and Jebel Jais on stage five (21.5km @ 5.4%) are the two queen stages in the UAE. Jebel Hafeet was ridden twice at last year’s race, where Adam Yates and Tadej Pogačar both won. It was Yates’ win on stage three which secured him the GC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/download_4_1024x1024.png?v=1613665051\" alt=\"UAE Tour stage 3\"></p>\n<p><em>Stage five of the UAE Tour, which finishes atop Jebel Jais (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>The other four stages are flat as a pancake and will be contested in a mass-sprint. The only notable emission from the route is the wall of Hatta Dam.</p>\n<p>The leading favourite here has to be Tadej Pogačar. At the team’s home race, the Tour de France champ will look to improve on his second place overall last season, where he was disappointed to lose to Adam Yates at his team’s home race. He will be helped by Davide Fomolo and Diego Ulissi, who returns after being diagnosed with myocarditis.</p>\n<p>Adam Yates won the UAE Tour last year and debuts for the INEOS Grenadiers this time around. He is a one-week race specialist and could well be the opponent Pogačar fears most. As ever, the INEOS team is strong, with Filippo Ganna, Daniel Martínez and Tour de la Provence winner Iván Sosa starting. The time-trial will put-pay to Sosa’s GC chances here, though.</p>\n<p>We will see João Almeida back in action for the first time after his stupendous performance at the Giro d’Italia, where he claimed the maglia rosa on stage three and held it until stage eighteen. The Portuguese is now a name to be reckoned with and starts as a genuine threat to win the UAE Tour.</p>\n<p>Other GC protagonists include Rigoberto Urán, Emanuel Buchmann, Wout Poels, Alexey Lutsenko, Sepp Kuss and who knows, perhaps Chris Froome. The Brit is making his debut for Israel Start-Up as he aims to get back to his best with the Israeli outfit.</p>\n<p>The race is well suited to the sprinters with four clear opportunities to win – this can be seen with the sprinters present in the UAE. Caleb Ewan, Sam Bennett, Pascal Ackermann and Giacomo Nizzolo are the headline names.</p>\n<p>Fernando Gaviria had a down-year in 2020 and struggled at the Clásica de Almería earlier in 2021 – he will be desperate to get back to winning ways, and UAE-Team Emirates will be equally keen to wrack up the wins on home soil.</p>\n<p>Another sprinter to look out for is Jasper Philipsen who starts alongside Mathieu van der Poel for Alpecin-Fenix. Philipsen will likely sprint for his new team – he won stage 15 at La Vuelta last season. It will be intriguing to see what role Van der Poel is to play at the race, with the GC too difficult for him.</p>\n<p>One final sprinter we will be keeping a keen eye on is Stefan Bissegger. The 22-year-old Swiss is talented in both time-trialling and sprinting. With no other sprinters in their line-up, EF Education-NIPPO will give him an opportunity after a good display at the Binckbank Tour last year.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Tadej Pogačar, Adam Yates, João Almeida</p>\n<p><strong>Dark horses:</strong> Emanuel Buchmann, Sepp Kuss, Alejandro Valverde, Patrick Konrad, Jack Haig, Chris Froome</p>\n<h4><b>Omloop het Nieuwsblad - WT (27/02)</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00032619-003_1024x1024_a752da38-9638-4bce-9397-4a004b49d576_1024x1024.jpg?v=1613409010\" alt=\"\"></b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-2021-preview\"><em><b>Read our full Omloop Het Nieuwsblad 2021: Preview</b></em></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘The season doesn’t start until Omloop!’ </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first of the Flanders Classics, Omloop het Nieuwsblad kicks-off Belgium's opening weekend on Saturday. Omloop includes many of the most revered cobbled climbs in Flanders, including the Muur and the Bosberg, both can create a selective group of riders in the final 20 kilometres. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This race is crucial for those looking to focus on the Spring Classics. The 2020 edition saw Trek’s Jasper Stuyven arriving at the finish alongside countryman Yves Lampaert, who was beaten by Stuyven in a sprint. Both men will return this season among the favourites. But they will face fierce competition.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Royal Bernard Drome Classic - 1.Pro (27/02) </b></h4>\n<p>The racing in France does not stop for Belgium’s opening weekend, with two difficult races taking place in the Ardèche region. The Royal Bernard Drome Classic was introduced in 2013 as 1.1 category event, but has since risen to .Pro status.</p>\n<p>The riders will start and finish in Eurre, south-west of Grenoble. A gruelling 200km is on the cards with climbs aplenty. It wouldn't come as a surprise to see half the field DNF. The Col de la Grande Limite (3.8km @ 6.6%) and the Cote des Roberts (1.6km @ 8%) will force many riders out the back.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/download_2_1024x1024.png?v=1613666563\" alt=\"Royal Bernard Drome Classic\"></p>\n<p><em>Royal Bernard Drome Classic (via La Flamme Rouge)</em></p>\n<p>Previous winners include Romain Bardet and Lillian Calmejane. The 2020 edition was decided in a three-up sprint between Vincenzo Nibali, Warren Barguil and Simon Clarke, with the Aussie ending victorious.</p>\n<p>Although the startlist is still provisional, some very good riders plan on startling, headlined by Marc Hirschi. It was thought that the Swiss would make his UAE-Team Emirates debut at the UAE Tour, but will ride in France instead. The parcours suit him in France making him the leading favourite.</p>\n<p>Like Hirschi, they successive short climbs will work in the favour of Mike Woods. The Canadian has punch in abundance, it helped him finish on the podium at La Flèche Wallonne behind Hirschi last year. He will lead Israel Start-Up here.</p>\n<p>Thibaut Pinot and David Gaudu ride for Groupama-FDJ, with both looking to build their season for the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France – their respective goals.</p>\n<p>The Royal Bernard Drome Classic will give us our first opportunity to see American Quinn Simmons in action this year. Coming off an impressive neo-pro year with Trek-Segafredo, Simmons will look to get his head down this season. The route suits him, and he cannot be counted out.</p>\n<p><strong>Favourites:</strong> Marc Hirschi, Mike Woods, Warren Barguil</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Horses:</strong> Quinn Simmons, Magnus Cort, Guillaume Martin</p>\n<h4><b>Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne - 1.Pro (28/02)</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Jungels_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612203018\" alt=\"Bob Jungels\"></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bob Jungels won Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne in 2019.

Although featuring the Oude-Kwaremont, the main difficulties take place further from the finish line, with the final 50km largely flat. This means a sprint is more likely, but the previous two editions have seen a Deceuninck-Quick Step rider go solo late on to win - Bob Jungels did just that in 2019 and Kasper Asgreen in 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The winner should be undeterred by crosswinds or other adverse weather which seem to be ever-present at KBK. We can expect similar contenders to Omloop, leaning slightly towards the sprinters.</span></p>\n<h4>Faun-Ardèche Classic<b> - 1.Pro (28/02)</b>\n</h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Cavagna_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612203049\" alt=\"Remi Cavagna\"></b></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remi Cavagna won the Faun-Archeche Classic in 2020. (Image credit: </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allan McKenzie/SWpix.com</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span></i></p>\n<p>The Faun-Archeche Classic is a compelling race in its own right which can be decided in a reduced sprint or with a long-range attack. The Saint-Romain-de-Lerps is the major difficulty at 6.1km and 7.2%, but lots of other short climbs will undoubtedly sap the legs of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Remi Cavagna went solo early in 2020 and was not seen again, winning by a whopping two minutes and 51 seconds. Only 43 riders finished, with distinct groups few and far between as riders battled just to reach the finish in the wake of Cavagna. More of the same in 2021 please!</p>\n<p>The riders on the startline closely mirror the Royal Bernard Drome Classic, which takes place the day before. This means that Marc Hirschi will start as one of the main protagonists again. Although, the weekend in France will be Hirschi’s first racings days of the calendar year, so we can’t be sure of his form just yet.</p>\n<p>Magnus Cort is a strong rider who can withstand climbs, whilst also possessing a very quick sprint finish. The combination of these two abilities have helped the Dane claim stages at the Tour de France and Vuelta Espana. If he is there in the final kilometres he could be very difficult to stop.</p>\n<p>Warren Barguil found his calling card last season in the one-day classics. He had previously been focusing on stage races but finished in the top-5 at Liege-Bastogne-Liege and La Flèche Wallonne, as well as fourth place at the Faun Ardèche Classic last season. He has displayed all the qualities required to win this race for Arkéa–Samsic.</p>\n<p>Like Arkéa, AG2R Citroën will be desperate to do well on home soil. They look to bring a powerful team which features new recruit Bob Jungels, Dorian Godon and Nans Peters – all of whom could launch a successful long-range attack.</p>\n<p>Favourites: Marc Hirschi, Magnus Cort, Warren Barguil, Bob Jungels</p>\n<p>Outsiders: Odd Christian Eiking, Jacopo Mosca, Dorian Godon</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cover photo: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWPix.com</span></em></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-UFKPji\"></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"c6c72b38af84b0572cdce5e2d82ce86761f0eae1b909518f9332e9783c8f12c6","category":"Cycling"}
