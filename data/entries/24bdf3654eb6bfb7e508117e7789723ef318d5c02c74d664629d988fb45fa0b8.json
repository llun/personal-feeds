(credit: EVGA / Nvidia)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The past year of graphics card reviews has been an exercise in dramatic asterisks, and for good reason. Nvidia and AMD have seen fit to ensure members of the press have access to new graphics cards ahead of their retail launches, which has placed us in a comfy position to praise each of their latest-gen offerings: good prices, tons of power.</p>\n<p>Then we see our comment sections explode with unsatisfied customers wondering <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/demand-will-probably-exceed-supply-nvidia-explains-rtx-30-shortages/\">how the heck to actually buy them</a>. I've since softened my tune on these pre-launch previews.</p>\n<p>I say all of this up front about the Nvidia RTX 3060, going on sale today, February 25 (at 12pm ET, if you're interested in entering the day-one sales fray) because it's the first Nvidia GPU I've tested in a while to make my cautious stance easier. The company has been on a tear with its RTX 3000-series of cards in terms of sheer consumer value, particularly compared to equivalent prior-gen cards (the $1,499 RTX 3090 notwithstanding), but the $329 RTX 3060 (not to be confused with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/nvidia-announces-the-399-rtx-3060-ti-and-weve-tested-it/\">December's 3060 Ti</a>) doesn't quite pull the same weight. It's a good 1080p card with 1440p room to flex, but it's not the next-gen jump in its Nvidia price category we've grown accustomed to.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744687#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744687&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24bdf3654eb6bfb7e508117e7789723ef318d5c02c74d664629d988fb45fa0b8","category":"Tech"}
