{"title":"Charlie Warzel: ‘This Is the Awful Voice Inside My Head’","link":"https://warzel.substack.com/p/this-is-the-awful-voice-inside-my","date":1625180872000,"content":"\n<p>If you think I’m a jerk for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/apple-remote-work\">my response</a> to that leaked letter from a subset of Apple employees unhappy about the company’s new “three days per week on site, two days remote” policy, you might enjoy this piece from Charlie Warzel, on his new Galaxy Brain site, responding to it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The voice says: <em>You are free to choose your job. But once you’ve\ndone that, it’s time to fall in line.</em> It argues that you should\nbe extra grateful for what your company provides you — a salary,\npurpose, any auxiliary benefits — and not to think as much about\nwhat you provide to your company. After all, <em>you</em> agreed to take\nthis job. <em>You</em> signed the contract. And, most importantly, you\nhave options. <em>If you don’t like it, leave.</em></p>\n\n<p>These are the words of a bully. This line of argument is designed\nto make those speaking up feel as if they’re being ungrateful,\nunreasonable and hysterical. The point is to intimidate employees\ninto silence. Listen to Gruber’s tone, here, which quite literally\nasks: <em>Who do these people think they are?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“And who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the\ncompany’s on-site culture? Do they think Apple built a new $4\nbillion campus on a lark? Three days a week on site and two days\nremote is a <em>huge</em> change for Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t regret a word or emoji of my piece, and I’ve heard — privately — from a <em>lot</em> of Apple folks thanking me for it. So I think my take still speaks for itself, and I shan’t respond to much of Warzel’s take. But quite a few people who objected to my piece took away the same thing Warzel did regarding my mention of the new Apple Park campus. I’m not in any way arguing that Apple ought to keep people on site because they built the new campus; I’m saying the reasons they built the new campus haven’t changed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tellingly, he disguises this disdain for employee autonomy with a\nclassic tactic: the ‘culture fit’ argument:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Given that these letters <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook\">keep</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook\">leaking</a> to Zoe Schiffer\nat The Verge, I can’t help but think that the problem for Apple\nis that they’ve grown so large that they’ve wound up hiring a lot\nof people who aren’t a good fit for Apple, and that it was a\nmistake for Apple to ever hook up a company-wide Slack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The culture fit argument might sound intuitive at first. It’s\nmeant to suggest that “if you don’t believe in our mission, you\nprobably shouldn’t work here.” But that’s not what it’s actually\nsaying. Culture fit is really a way that power reproduces and\nsustains itself in an organization and silences any dissent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That might be one way some people argue about “culture fit”, but it’s not what I meant. Apple has, since its inception, had a company culture that encourages dissent and individuality. What they don’t have is a culture that encourages passive-aggressive, meandering 1,400-word letters that claim to demand nothing but make demands nonetheless, or try to rhetorically paint anyone who disagrees as being against inclusivity, or, more ridiculously, the environment. Not getting everything you want is not being “unheard”. And more so, the company has the <em>opposite</em> of a culture that leaks internal discussions with the media. Or that leaks <em>anything</em> for that matter.</p>\n\n<p>Compare and contrast <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook\">that 1,400-word letter</a> about remote work with <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/21/panzer-this-one-email\">Bertrand Serlet’s recently-released 2007 email</a> laying out the entire plan for third-party apps on iOS in a mere 130 words. It’s pretty clear from the first word of Serlet’s email — “Fine, […]” — that Serlet was opposed to allowing third-party native apps. (I’m pretty sure Serlet had argued, and lost, in favor of sticking with — and improving —the web-apps-for-third-party-“apps” strategy that was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote\">announced</a> at WWDC just before the iPhone’s release.) But, he lost the argument, so, <em>fine</em>, he acknowledges a decision had been made and he laid out what he deemed to be the best course forward from that decision.</p>\n\n<p><em>That</em> is very Apple. You argue, you tussle, you make your case, and then when a decision has been made you go for it, even if you don’t like it.</p>\n\n<p>But if you still think I’m being an ass about this, enjoy and savor Warzel’s response. It is worth a read regardless.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/01/warzel-awful-voice\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"43f26065adb2655f9fb344f0bbe45b8481cc023c98f38d5a9ec8eaae7c829488","category":"Tech"}
