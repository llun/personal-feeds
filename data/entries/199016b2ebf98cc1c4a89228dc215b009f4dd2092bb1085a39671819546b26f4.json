We definitely feel it achieves that optimal condition of satisfying both form and function.'</p>\n<p>The components will also go through extensive quality control using ultrasonic testing by world renowned expert Raoul Luescher from Luescher Teknik to ensure maximum safety (and quality) of its parts.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9590/bastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos#20\"><p><span>Image 21 of</span> 27</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/masonhender-09554.jpg?itok=Jkfp8Frz\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 21 of </span>27</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Components and features</h3>\n<p>Bastion is a pioneer in 3D printing and uses Grade 5 Titanium Alloy for its parts. The new cockpit consists of three main parts.</p>\n<p>Firstly the fork, which has 3D printed titanium crown and dropouts alongside carbon fibre legs and steerer tube. For integration purposes Bastion has used a D-shaped steerer and matched that with a D-shaped bore in the stem. The bar stem consists of 3D printed titanium stem and drops with a single piece carbon fibre crossbar.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/5405/blow-by-blow-inside-silca\">Blow by blow: inside Silca</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/5577/silca-grande-americano-seat-roll-review\">Silca Grande Americano Seat Roll review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/garmin/9104/garmin-edge-1030-plus-gps-bike-computer-review\">Garmin Edge 1030 Plus GPS bike computer review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/6361/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review-navigation-colour-screen-long-battery-life\">Wahoo Elemnt Roam long-term review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nFinally there is also a 3D printed titanium compression plug bonded into the steerer that reduces the risk of damage to the steerer as a result of over-tightening.</p>\n<p>Dimensions of the system can be completely customised for the rider thanks to the ease of 3D printing to maximise comfort, efficiency and aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>Find out more about Bastion Cycles at <a href=\"https://www.bastioncycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bastioncycles.com</a> and if you're interested in buying one for yourself visit Bastion's UK partner, Velo Atelier, at <a href=\"https://www.veloatelier.co.uk/bastion\" target=\"_blank\">veloatelier.co.uk</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9590/bastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos\">Bastion Cycles integrated cockpit photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>7 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9590%2Fbastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Bastion%20Cycles%20integrated%20cockpit%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9590%2Fbastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Bastion%20Cycles%20integrated%20cockpit%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9590%2Fbastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Bastion%20Cycles%20integrated%20cockpit%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9590%2Fbastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9590/bastion-cycles-integrated-cockpit-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 27</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/masonhender-09229.jpg?itok=81yUfy7J\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/components\">Components</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"199016b2ebf98cc1c4a89228dc215b009f4dd2092bb1085a39671819546b26f4","category":"Cycling"}
