But the method—which requires players to plug a USB keyboard into their PS5—for entering those newly discovered \"debug mode\" codes has some wondering if developer Housemarque intended for them to be accessible in the final product.</p>\n<p>YouTuber TheRandomizer was among the first to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PpXU0DReU\">publicize the cheats</a>, posting a video showing a <em>Returnal</em> player dropping new weapons at will and teleporting to previous locations in the middle of play.
