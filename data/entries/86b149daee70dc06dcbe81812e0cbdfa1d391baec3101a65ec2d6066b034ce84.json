Earlier this year, an FCC filing from Apple revealed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/27/iphone-12-wirelessly-charge-accessories-fcc/\">iPhone 12 models might have an inactive reverse charging feature</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Redesigned 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Still on Track for Mass Production in Third Quarter</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple is still on track to begin mass production of the upcoming redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with mini-LED displays in the third quarter of this year, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-render.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith production kicking off sometime between now and late September, rumors are indicating we could see an introduction of the new machines around the end of that timeframe, perhaps in October to provide a bit of separation from the iPhone 13 launch in its traditional September launch window.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Likely to Debut Next-Gen 3nm Chip Technology in 2022 iPad Pro</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple will reportedly launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/02/apple-debut-3nm-chip-in-2022-ipad/\">a new iPad next year featuring a processor based on TSMC's next-generation 3nm process</a>, resulting in faster performance and improved power efficiency.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/ipad-pro-3nm-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the report is accurate, this would be the second time in recent years that Apple has debuted new chip technology in an ‌iPad‌ before an iPhone. In September 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">fourth-generation iPad Air</a> was announced with the A14 Bionic chip, around one month before the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 lineup</a> was unveiled with the same chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 2022 iPad Pro lineup is also rumored to see the mini-LED display technology from the current 12.9-inch model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/kuo-2022-11-inch-ipad-pro-mini-led/\">extended to include the 11-inch model</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Massive New iPad Pro Could Finally Replace the Laptop</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has engineers and designers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/massive-new-ipad-pro-could-replace-the-laptop/\">exploring future iPad models with larger display sizes</a> that could be released within a few years from now, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. The current iPad Pro is available in 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iPad-More-Than-12.9-Inches-Feature-Orange.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLarger display sizes would help further blur the lines between the iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro, which is available with up to a 16-inch display. However, some customers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/21/users-underwhelmed-by-ios-15-and-ipados-15-survey-suggests/\">continue to feel underwhelmed about the iPadOS software platform</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Calls Facebook-Backed Study on Preinstalled Apps 'Seriously Flawed'</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe majority of apps used by iPhone users are made by Apple, according to a study commissioned by Facebook. However, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/facebook-study-on-preinstalled-app-usage/\">Apple spokesperson fired back</a>, claiming that the survey's methodology was \"seriously flawed in a number of ways.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Facebook-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously admitted that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/31/mark-zuckerberg-says-imessage/\">iMessage is his company's \"biggest competitor by far,\"</a> and Facebook <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/\">also took issue</a> with Apple's new requirement for apps to receive a user's permission to track them.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jul-8-2021\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/10/top-stories-iphone-13-14-ipad-pro-rumors/\">Top Stories: iPhone 13 and 14, iPad Pro, and MacBook Pro Rumors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-13-and-14-ipad-pro-and-macbook-pro-rumors.2303819/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gL7SS5FkZYA:ehLmait-GXE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gL7SS5FkZYA:ehLmait-GXE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gL7SS5FkZYA\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"86b149daee70dc06dcbe81812e0cbdfa1d391baec3101a65ec2d6066b034ce84","category":"Apple"}
