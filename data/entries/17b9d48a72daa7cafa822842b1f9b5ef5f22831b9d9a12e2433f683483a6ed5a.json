The company has obtained <a href=\"https://www.cameroncounty.us/order-closing-boca-chica-beach-and-state-hwy-4-march-29/\">a road closure</a> of Boca Chica Highway in South Texas from noon local time (17:00 UTC) to 5 pm (22:00 UTC). SpaceX has confirmed it is targeting a high-altitude flight to 10 km, similar to recent missions, and will seek to demonstrate a smooth launch, controlled descent, and vertical landing.</p>\n<p>Weather is a concern today, with showers in the vicinity of the launch site on Monday morning. However, high-resolution forecast models indicate these showers will pull away from the area this afternoon. Skies should remain mostly cloudy, however, and it's not clear how much visibility SpaceX will want for this test launch. Tuesday's weather should be more favorable, if the company holds off for a day.</p>\n<p>SpaceX will provide a webcast for this test flight, and the link will be inserted into this post when it goes live.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752419#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752419&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"17b9d48a72daa7cafa822842b1f9b5ef5f22831b9d9a12e2433f683483a6ed5a","category":"Tech"}
