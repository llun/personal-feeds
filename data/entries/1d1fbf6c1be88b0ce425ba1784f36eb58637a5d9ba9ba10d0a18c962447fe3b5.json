It retells the first two seasons of the popular Cobra Kai Netflix show, with players able to choose between rebuilding and reopening the Cobra Kai dojo with Johnny Lawrence or sticking with the traditional Miyagi-do Karate with Daniel LaRusso.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/cobra-kai-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789451\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the game, players will build their dojos, recruit students from the TV series, and train them up to become All Valley Champions before challenging other senseis from around the world. There's a single-player story mode and a PvP multiplayer tournament mode.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/cobra-kai-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1455\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789449\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nGameplay is card based, with cards based on karate punches, throws, and kicks, plus special attacks and combos for every fighter. Choosing a winning series of cards requires strategy, but with the fight-based theme, the game is action packed. In between challenges, players can train their fighters, level up their belt ranking, build decks, and customize characters.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/cobra-kai-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1455\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789450\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nCobra Kai: Card Fighter is available starting today, and one lucky winner can enter our &zwnj;giveaway&zwnj; to win an &zwnj;iPhone 12 Pro&zwnj; (in the color of your choice), plus &#36;15,000 in-game cash to make purchases like Training Room upgrades, Student Booster Packs, and Tokens.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA second place winner will receive &#36;10,000 in-game cash for the Cobra Kai: Card Fighter game, and a third place winner will receive &#36;6,000 in-game cash.
