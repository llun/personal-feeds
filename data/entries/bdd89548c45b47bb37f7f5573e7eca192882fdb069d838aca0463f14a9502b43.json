The series where I nag pro riders to jump on a call with me for 15 minutes, chit chat about their race bikes and then dash off and take a few snaps of the bike in the comfort of their back yard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of you should be aware of Clara Honsinger, after all, she got fourth at this year&#8217;s World Cyclocross Championships. The only non-Dutchie in the top six. She fought her way to two-second places at cross World Cups and is the current US national CX champ. If that wasn&#8217;t enough to focus on,  for 2021, she&#8217;s stepping up her road race game by joining the long-standing Team Tibco-SVB. With that move she&#8217;s gaining another race bike, and in a happy coincidence, it&#8217;s yet another Cannondale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honsinger has been aboard Cannondale for some time when riding to multiple victories in the cross world, and with Tibco-SVB she now has a Super Six to add to her fleet. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and say it &#8211; it&#8217;s not quite as flash in the pain scheme department as her custom SuperX, which must easily be one of the flashiest on the World Cup circuit, but hey, when you&#8217;re the national champ, you deserve a sweet ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505673\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9.jpg 1333w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9-650x488.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9-190x143.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9-510x382.jpg 510w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9-1080x810.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image9-16x12.jpg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\" /><figcaption>Clara&#8217;s road bike for the season with Team Tibco is a Cannondale Super Six.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Chatting with Clara, it turns out she has a long history with the brand, all the way back to (probably) pushing her dad up hills on the Cannondale tandem to when she was a kid to rolling up to her first road race on her mum&#8217;s hand-me-down Cannondale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video, we start with Clara&#8217;s Tibco-SVB team issue Super-Six. The Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 9170 equipped race bike will see action mostly in US-based races this season. There&#8217;s hope that a bit of an assault on European races schedule at some point, but it&#8217;s not yet set in stone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the tech problems that come with racing both CX for one team and road for a different team. How moments of inbuilt natural instincts can cause miss shifts when jumping from one race bike to another, after all, her road bike is decked out in Shimano&#8217;s top shifting equipment to her cross bike is rigged with SRAM&#8217;s Red AXS groupset. Problems I bet we all wish we could experience. And of course, I wouldn&#8217;t be a cycling journalist worth my salt if I didn&#8217;t try and get some insight into the type of tires and pressure that she runs when going up against the world best cyclocross stars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click the video above for more. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI-1340x893.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505685\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505685\" class=\"wp-image-505685\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI-1340x893.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI-650x433.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_16-©TFMUZZI.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">Lil&#8217; Clara.</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI-1340x893.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"505679\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=505679\" class=\"wp-image-505679\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI-1340x893.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI-650x433.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Superprestige-Gavere-2020_19-©TFMUZZI.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">Clara&#8217;s custom painted Cannondale SuperX.
