Enraged by Hari's claims, the ruling Cleons – a long line of emperor clones – fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they're forced to reckon with the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.</blockquote>\"Foundation\" stars Emmy Award nominees Jared Harris and Lee Pace, alongside Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Terrence Mann, Cassian Bilton, and Alfred Enoch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple released a new trailer for \"Foundation\" alongside today's announcement:\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe first-ever on-screen adaptation of Asimov's iconic, award-winning novel series is executive produced by David S. Goyer, who is best known for writing the screenplays to several superhero films, such as \"Batman Begins\" and \"Man of Steel.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"In the decades since the 'Foundation' series first saw print, Asimov's prophetic science-fiction work has never been more relevant than it is now,\" said Goyer. \"Growing up, I devoured 'Foundation' and dreamed of one day seeing it on screen – but a feature film didn't seem big enough to embrace the ambition. Thanks to the broader landscape of streaming and a valuable partnership with Apple and Skydance, we are able to bring the series to the screen in a way that truly does it justice.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, with a free seven-day trial available.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/apple-tv-plus-foundation-release-date/\">Apple TV+ Epic Saga 'Foundation' Based on Isaac Asimov's Best-Selling Novels Premieres September 24</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-epic-saga-foundation-based-on-isaac-asimovs-best-selling-novels-premieres-september-24.2302569/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pBFwwvRAb0Q:zLt06KUUu_Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pBFwwvRAb0Q:zLt06KUUu_Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pBFwwvRAb0Q\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a9fd540aff1671f2e90808636e612c4c0ee5ce687fb8d5963422c7426bca2e4","category":"Apple"}
