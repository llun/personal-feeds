They informed him that the timeout period is currently three days, but hinted that this could change in future:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>I talked to folks from Apple today about some of this. The timeout period for when an AirTag will play a sound if separated from its owner is currently three days — but that's not baked into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> themselves. It's a server-side setting in the ‌Find My‌ network, so Apple can adjust it if real-world use suggests that three days is too long or too short.</blockquote>If someone finds an AirTag after hearing it make a sound, they can use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/lost-airtags-read-nfc-android-phones/\">any device that has NFC</a>, such as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Android phone, to see if its owner marked it as lost and help return it. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirTags‌‌‌ start at $29 each or $99 for a four-pack. Online orders open this Friday, April 23, with ‌‌‌AirTags‌‌‌ shipping April 30.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/daringfireball-net/\">daringfireball.net</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/airtags-play-sound-after-three-days/\">AirTags Separated From Owners for Three Days or More Play Audible Sound When Moved</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtags-separated-from-owners-for-three-days-or-more-play-audible-sound-when-moved.2292545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-ZeaL5XcVYs:1Z57Nz8vu_o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-ZeaL5XcVYs:1Z57Nz8vu_o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-ZeaL5XcVYs\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"147aff5844466ecba5c67cfdfe34f69f8e8c95eb9f6cc9bdb0d66b32658ff92c","category":"Apple"}
