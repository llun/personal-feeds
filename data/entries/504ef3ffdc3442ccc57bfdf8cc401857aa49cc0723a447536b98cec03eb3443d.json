The U.S. DoJ is looking into how Apple uses its sign-in button and \"other &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules that make it difficult for users to switch to a rival device maker.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe probe is examining Apple's control over the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, the fees that it charges developers, and complaints on restrictions on location tracking and other forms of tracking that Apple's own apps are not subject to.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple spokesman Fred Sainz declined to comment on the antitrust investigation when queried by <em>The Information</em>, but said that the Sign in With Apple feature is designed to give customers a privacy-focused alternative to sign in options provided by other companies.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Department of Justice has not yet decided whether to sue Apple, and that decision could take months. Facebook and Google are also facing antitrust investigations, and lawsuits have already been filed against them.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nU.S. antitrust regulators last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/26/us-antitrust-investigation-app-store/\">launched an investigation</a> into Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees and policies. Led by the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, the inquiry ultimately likened Apple, Google. Facebook, and Amazon to oil barons and railroad tycoons.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe committee <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/06/us-antitrust-report-apple-recommendations/\">released a 450 page report</a> highlighting CEO interviews, over 1.3 million documents, and findings from hearings with app developers. The report recommended new antitrust laws after concluding that Apple had a monopoly over the distribution of software apps on iOS devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is also facing antitrust investigations from in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/eu-opens-investigations-app-store-apple-pay/\">European Union</a>,<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/australia-opens-antitrust-inquiry-into-app-store/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/russia-apple-abused-app-store-position/\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/29/apple-and-amazon-face-germany-antitrust-scrutiny/\">Germany</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/07/italy-confirms-third-antitrust-inquiry-into-apple/\">Italy</a>, and has been fined by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/16/france-fines-apple-1b-euros-anti-competitive/\">France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/korea-ftc-approves-apple-correction-scheme/\">South Korea</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">theinformation.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sign-in-with-apple/\">Sign in with Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/sign-in-with-apple-antitrust-probe/\">Apple Facing Antitrust Probe Over &#039;Sign in With Apple&#039; and Other Developer Complaints</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-facing-antitrust-probe-over-sign-in-with-apple-and-other-developer-complaints.2285939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1Rt7Rf2Ub4Q:l1D5aEB0vbM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1Rt7Rf2Ub4Q:l1D5aEB0vbM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1Rt7Rf2Ub4Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"504ef3ffdc3442ccc57bfdf8cc401857aa49cc0723a447536b98cec03eb3443d","category":"Apple"}
