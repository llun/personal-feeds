This chassis will serve as the backbone for a robotic spacecraft that will explore a metallic asteroid for the first time. This ambitious mission, named Psyche after the eponymous asteroid it will explore, is due to launch next summer on a Falcon Heavy rocket.</p>\n<p>Once in space, the spacecraft will use an innovative means of propulsion, known as Hall thrusters, to reach the asteroid. This will be the first time a spacecraft has ventured into deep space using Hall thrusters, and absent this technology the Psyche mission probably wouldn't be happening—certainly not at its cost of just less than $1 billion.</p>\n<p>For David Oh, the large, boxy chassis represents one of those \"full circle\" moments in life. More than two decades ago, he worked on Hall thruster technology as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He would go on to work for Space Systems/Loral, which first put the propulsive technology on large commercial satellites and would later be acquired by Maxar.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754021#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754021&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"06435e0efdede92228d2872572f433093a2f2c60c4ea5484f2c82bb3f3e61928","category":"Tech"}
