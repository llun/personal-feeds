{"title":"Tim Carmody on Jeff Bezos","link":"https://amazonchronicles.substack.com/p/jeff-bezos-exits-stage-right","date":1612390859000,"content":"\n<p>Tim Carmody:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Amazon] will not abandon the hard work of physical infrastructure\nfor the sweet, high-margin lure of the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few reasons for this. The first one is that it is\nimpossible to do digital retail (and increasingly,\nbrick-and-mortar retail) at Amazon’s scale without having the\ntechnological capacity a company like Amazon has. If you spun off\nor sidelined the retail business, you’d be either kneecapping it\nor forcing it to buy back the services that the retail side of the\nbusiness already gets in house. Amazon has a huge advantage in\nboth digital and physical logistics; that’s better than a moat,\nit’s <em>two</em> moats. It’s a moat surrounded by a ring of fire with a\ndragon inside. You don’t let that go because a consultant or\nactivist shareholder points out that technically your profit\nmargins could be higher if you only did one or the other. Amazon\nhas never run its business that way under Bezos and it would be\nincredibly foolish for the company to start doing so now,\nespecially when he’s still in a position to influence precisely\nthose sorts of decisions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Tim Carmody on Jeff Bezos’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/03/carmody-bezos\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"726e223a2dbf2554c8f1fa91f6730226468080373cc1c1fdd122e5a054153794","category":"Tech"}
