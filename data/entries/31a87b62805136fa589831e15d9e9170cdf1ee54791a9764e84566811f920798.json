{"title":"Doppler Music Player to Gain Siri Support, Spotlight Integration, and CarPlay App","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/doppler-music-app-gains-carplay-siri-support/","date":1613478482000,"content":"<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/doppler-2-music-player/id1468459747\">Doppler</a> is getting a significant update next week, bringing some notable track and album features to the increasingly popular third-party music playing app for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Doppler-e1613465076401.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1918\" height=\"2000\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783774\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nFor those unfamiliar, the Doppler app offers users an alternative way to experience their music library, sporting an adaptive minimalist interface with an emphasis on album artwork/metadata editing on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and support for importing MP3, FLAC, AAC, and WAV file formats without having to connect to a computer.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn December, Doppler Listening reports were added, offering users an elegant overview of their listening habits over the course of the year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAnd in the latest v2.3 update due to roll out on February 23, Doppler users can ask <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> to play specific albums, songs and playlists within Doppler. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; commands like \"Play all songs by James Blake in Doppler\" or \"Play my Liked Songs playlist in Doppler\" are now supported in English, French, German, and Spanish.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/doppler-siri@1x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1345\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783777\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nUsers will still need to include \"in Doppler\" at the end of commands so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/\">Siri knows which app to use</a>, but the developer says this should change in iOS 14.5.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDoppler will also support &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Suggestions from next week. As Doppler is used, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can learn patterns around how and when music is listened to. For example, when headphones are connected, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can intelligently suggest music to play.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn addition, Doppler 2.3 will integrate with Spotlight search. Songs and playlists show in search results on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>. Results can be tapped to open in Doppler, or to start playing without having to open the app. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/doppler-carplay@1x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1718\" height=\"472\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783775\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe third and final integration is Doppler for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> â€” a custom &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; app to access and play content from the Doppler library. The &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; interface offers library-wide playback and shuffle buttons, as well as Recently Added albums and usual artists, albums and playlists. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; support is also included, so Doppler can be controlled in &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; with voice alone. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDoppler costs &#36;6.99 and is available to download for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
