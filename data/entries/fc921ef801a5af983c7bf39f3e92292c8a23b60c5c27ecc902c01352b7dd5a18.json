It's been a long time since the XcodeGhost attack, but Apple's trial with Epic is surfacing new details.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTrial documents highlighted by <em><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7bbmz/the-fortnite-trial-is-exposing-details-about-the-biggest-iphone-hack-of-all-time\">Motherboard</a></em> indicate that a total of 128 million users downloaded apps with the XcodeGhost malware, including 18 million users in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nXcodeGhost was one of the biggest attacks against <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users to date due to the number of ‌iPhone‌ users that were impacted. The 128 million impacted users got malware from downloads of more than 2,500 affected apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBased on emails shared in the trial, Apple worked to determine the impact of the attack and how to best notify those who downloaded infected apps. \"Due to the large number of customers potentially affected, do we want to send an email to all of them?\" Apple's ‌App Store‌ vice president Matt Fischer asked.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple did ultimately inform users that downloaded XcodeGhost apps, and also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/24/xcodeghost-top-25-apps-apple-list/\">published a list</a> of the top 25 most popular apps that were compromised. Apple removed all of the infected apps from the ‌App Store‌, and provided information to developers to help them validate Xcode going forward.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nXcodeGhost was a widespread attack, but it was not effective or dangerous. At the time, Apple said that it had no information to suggest that the malware was ever used for any malicious purpose nor that sensitive personal data was stolen, but it did collect app bundle identifiers, network details, and device names and types.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/xcodeghost-malware-2015-128-million-ios-users/\">'XcodeGhost' Malware Attack in 2015 Impacted 128 Million iOS Users, According to Trial Documents</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/xcodeghost-malware-attack-in-2015-impacted-128-million-ios-users-according-to-trial-documents.2295257/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Mxdfh7qqgH8:GYNlRdT3POQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Mxdfh7qqgH8:GYNlRdT3POQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Mxdfh7qqgH8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fc921ef801a5af983c7bf39f3e92292c8a23b60c5c27ecc902c01352b7dd5a18","category":"Apple"}
