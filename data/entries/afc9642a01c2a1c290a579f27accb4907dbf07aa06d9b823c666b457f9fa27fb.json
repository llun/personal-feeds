Being small in size, the <span>Škoda Academy riders are encouraged to develop strengths and weaknesses in a supportive and nurturing environment.'</span></p>\n<p>The scheme currently has four riders enrolled who joined in 2019 and hope to graduate at the end of this year.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3PMTnOrQhs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8829/will-running-help-or-hinder-my-cycling\">Will running help or hinder my cycling?</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9182/gallery-sea-sand-but-no-sun-at-the-cyclocross-world-championships\">Gallery: Sea, sand but no sun at the Cyclocross World Championships</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9205/uci-bans-super-tuck-descending-position\">UCI bans &#039;super tuck&#039; descending position</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8829/will-running-help-or-hinder-my-cycling\">Will running help or hinder my cycling?</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nRebbeca Richards, senior academy rider, said: 'Applying for the Škoda Cycling Academy is the best decision I have ever made. I've learnt so much from working with Dame Sarah and the Storey Racing team that my cycling is now at a whole new level compared to when I joined in 2019.</p>\n<p>'Without the Academy I wouldn't have had the opportunity to compete in a variety of rides and races such as the time-trials at the National Closed Circuit Championships, L'Étape du Tour and the inaugural Škoda V-Women's Tour. If you are a female cyclist looking to see how far you can go in the sport, then I would thoroughly recommend that you apply for the Academy. Good luck!'</p>\n<p>To apply for the Škoda DSI Cycling Academy, visit <a href=\"https://www.skoda.co.uk/discover/cycling-academy-sign-up\" target=\"_blank\">skoda.co.uk/discover/cycling-academy-sign-up</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"afc9642a01c2a1c290a579f27accb4907dbf07aa06d9b823c666b457f9fa27fb","category":"Cycling"}
