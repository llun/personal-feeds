It's square shaped and not too much bigger than the ‌AirPods‌, so it's useful for those who want a simple, space-saving charger.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis is not a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charger and when charging an ‌iPhone‌, it is limited to 7.5W, though it can charge Android devices faster than that. It comes with a 2-meter USB-C cable, but does not ship with a power adapter. Like other Nomad Base Stations, the mini features a padded black leather surface and a zinc frame.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSeparately, Nomad is also selling a new 20W USB-C power adapter that's ideal for use with the Base Station Mini or for other devices, including Apple's ‌MagSafe‌ Charger.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/nomad-power-adapter.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Base Station Mini is priced at $60 and the 20W USB-C Power Adapter is priced at $19. Both products can be purchased <a href=\"https://nomadgoods.com/\">from the Nomad website</a> starting today.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nomad/\">Nomad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/27/nomad-base-station-mini/\">Nomad Launches New Base Station Mini</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-launches-new-base-station-mini.2293492/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9yn14X0daBU:OSFasUYl1_I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9yn14X0daBU:OSFasUYl1_I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9yn14X0daBU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8a65b71096085800eb80b4f9c46a30f166292d3cb76f4500c4030c1ff811f07b","category":"Apple"}
