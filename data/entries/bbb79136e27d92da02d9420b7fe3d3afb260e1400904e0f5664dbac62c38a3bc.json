The Car Thing works over Bluetooth, or via an AUX or USB cable, and there are a variety of mounts that come with the device to ensure that it fits to the dashboard correctly. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/spotify-car-thing-2-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe device comes with three different types of dash and vent mounts to choose from, a car charger, and a USB-C cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInitially, the Car Thing will be made available for free for a limited period, with selected users only needing to pay for the cost of shipping. This is apparently because Spotify still sees the Car Thing as somewhat experimental. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen it reaches its full public release, the Car Thing will be available for $79.99, but it is as yet unclear when the retail release will take place.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCar Thing is now being offered on <a href=\"https://carthing.spotify.com\">an invite-only basis via its website</a> to U.S. Spotify Premium subscribers with a smartphone, where interested users can sign up to the waiting list.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/spotify-announces-the-car-thing-hardware-device/\">Spotify Announces the 'Car Thing' as its First Hardware Device</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-announces-the-car-thing-as-its-first-hardware-device.2291548/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KrTvXybtGos:U0MELmpQj5E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KrTvXybtGos:U0MELmpQj5E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KrTvXybtGos\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bbb79136e27d92da02d9420b7fe3d3afb260e1400904e0f5664dbac62c38a3bc","category":"Apple"}
