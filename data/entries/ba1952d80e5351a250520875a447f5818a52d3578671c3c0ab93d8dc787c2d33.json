Welcome to Women’s Cycling Weekly issue 20 🚴‍♀️</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My mathematically-challenged brain struggles with the concept of measuring things in weeks, usually children: “they’re 40 weeks old” — that simply does not make sense to me. But this particular ‘baby’ has been in the world for 20 weeks (or is perhaps still — in some ways— gestating). It feels like a nice, round number and some kind of milestone. I’ll pretend that is the reason I am giving away a copy of a book and that it was all entirely planned that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Competition Winner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, then, the winner of a copy of the Most Excellent <em><strong>Revolutions</strong></em> by Hannah Ross is…<strong>Rhian Denton</strong>! 🥳 Congrats! Hit ‘reply’ on this email and we’ll sort out your free copy of the book. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p>As the preamble to this newsletter is getting quite long, consider this a taster because in the coming weeks and months there may be some bonus long-form issues incoming. If you hate the idea of that, however, do let me know and <strong>maybe</strong> I’ll hold off on the</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/https-bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-public-images-8ee580b6-f98a-4ea7-910a-c3cc42d2bbb7_1706x960-1340x754.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No promises, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay that’s enough of that. Lots to cover this week, loads of great content, some (mostly) good news and the last (do we count Brabantse Pijl?) of the cobbled Classics. Sure, there’s a Paris-Roubaix-shaped hole in the calendar on Sunday, but fear not because it won’t be long before the Ardennes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thanks to <strong>CyclingTips </strong>for hosting and supporting WCW. If you’re reading this via the CT website, then maybe you fancy <a href=\"https://mamilrepeller.substack.com/\">subscribing</a> to get it direct in one hit — like a Johnson&amp;Johnson Covid shot — into your inbox?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>News 📰</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>After announcing the intention to do so in <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cofidis-to-launch-womens-team-in-2022/\">January</a>, <strong>Cofidis</strong><a href=\"https://equipecofidis.com/fr/actualites/2021-04-08/cofidis-prolonge-son-engagement-dans-le-cyclisme-jusqu-en-2025\"> has confirmed </a>that it will launch a women’s team in 2022 with a budget of €1m — love to see it. </li><li>His name appeared on the startlists for Dwars Door Vlaanderen and Gent-Wevelgem, but last weekend <strong>Flanders Classics</strong> said that they have asked Doltcini Van Eyck manager <strong>Marc Bracke</strong> — who was found guilty of ethics violations pertaining to harassment by the UCI Ethics Commission last year — not to come to their events. They do not, however, have the ability to enforce this until the UCI Disciplinary Commission decide on a sanction.</li><li>In the next episode of The UCI Doing Things Backwards, <strong>Aromitalia-Basso Bikes-Vaiano</strong> rider<strong> Letizia Borghesi </strong>was disqualified and fined 500CHF at <strong>Tour of Flanders</strong> (more than Annemiek van Vleuten took for winning) for throwing a bottle (it was later reduced to 200CHF). Borghesi said that she ‘felt like a criminal.’</li><li><strong>Loughborough University</strong> in the UK <a href=\"https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/news/2021/april/new-lightning-cycling-franchise-launched/\">have launched an elite women’s cycling team</a> who will compete at national level, called ‘<strong>Lightning Cycling</strong>’ great name. </li><li>Walmart heir, T<strong>om Walton</strong>, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/walmart-heir-and-cycling-proponent-tom-walton-denounces-arkansas-anti-trans-legislation/\">has added his voice </a>to the dissent over the anti-trans bill in Arkansas. The state is due to host the 2022 Cyclocross World Championships and many have called for a boycott of the event over the discriminatory law which prevents trans women and girls from competing in school sports team consistent with their identity. Elsewhere, the head of USA cycling<a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/usa-cycling-ceo-against-arkansas-boycott-says-it-would-be-ceremonial/\"> has said</a> that a boycott would be ‘ceremonial’. </li><li><strong>Kasia Niewiadoma</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wmncycling.com/kasia-extends-her-contract-through-to-end-of-2024/\">has extended her contract with </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.wmncycling.com/kasia-extends-her-contract-through-to-end-of-2024/\">Canyon//SRAM</a> </strong>to the end of 2024. Very much here for long-term contract extensions.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Results 🏆</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Last Sunday at <strong>Ronde van Vlaanderen</strong>/ <strong>Tour of Flanders</strong> 1.WWT – it was a case of <strong>Annemiek van Vleuten</strong> being back to her old tricks. <strong>Audrey Cordon Ragot</strong> of <strong>Trek-Segafredo</strong> spent 20km off the front solo from 42km to go. After a group split over the Koppenburg full of all of the favourites (apart from <strong>Marianne Vos </strong>of<strong> Jumbo-Visma</strong> and <strong>Kasia Niewiadoma</strong> of <strong>Canyon//SRAM</strong>) Van Vleuten attacked over the Paterburg and stayed away to the line. <strong>Lisa Brennauer </strong>of<strong>Ceratizit-WNT</strong> took the sprint for second, with <strong>Grace Brown </strong>of<strong> BikeExchange</strong>in third.

Watch the Rouleur Debrief with <strong>Tayler Wiles</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEdRzY-7_Sc\">here</a>. </li><li><strong>Chiara Consonni</strong> of <strong>Valcar Travel and Service</strong> took the win at <strong>Ronde de Mouscron 1.1</strong> on Monday with <strong>Jelena Erić</strong> of <strong>Movistar</strong> in second and <strong>Maria Martins</strong> of <strong>Drops-Le Col s/b Tempur</strong> in third.</li><li>Then, it was onto the first ever <strong>Scheldeprijs</strong> <strong>Women 1.1</strong> on Wednesday at which the riders were greeted by snow and rain. Barring a few crashes and splits the race stayed mostly together until 18-year-old <strong>Daniek Hengeveld </strong>of <strong>GT Krush Tunap</strong> — who made a similar move on the first stage of the <strong>Healthy Ageing Tour</strong>— chipped off the front with 44km to go. Hengeveld was caught and in another piece of symmetry with HAT, <strong>Lorena Wiebes </strong>of<strong> Team DSM</strong> (who crashed at the finish of the same stage while looking strong for the sprint) took the win. <strong>Emma Norsgaard</strong> of <strong>Movistar</strong> took second and <strong>Elisa Balsamo</strong> of <strong>Valcar Travel and Service</strong> second.

Remember <strong>Grace Brown</strong>’s winning move last year that put her firmly on the radar (and that she repeated this year at De Panne to take her first World Tour win)? </li><li>This week is also the Kuwait and Saudi Arabia national championships. Yes, that <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/news/a19978101/saudi-arabian-women-bike-race/\">Saudi Arabia</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/saudi-arabia#49dda6\">very same</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Read 🗞️</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The omnishambles that is the handling of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-says-disciplinary-commission-has-power-to-provisionally-suspend-bracke/\">Bracke case</a> continues. </li><li>In the absence of the first women’s <strong>Paris Roubaix</strong> this weekend how about reading a <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/dreams-and-curses-a-fictional-womens-paris-roubaix\">short story all about it</a>? </li><li>Speaking of the inaugural women’s Paris Roubaix, it might be postponed, but <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/news/road/paris-roubaix-some-races-are-too-special-for-the-men-to-keep-to-themselves/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=velonews&amp;utm_campaign=15943f72-b49b-47dc-92e8-493de76f0c5b\">the fact that it will happen at all marks progress</a>, says Sadhbh O’Shea. </li><li>Women <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a35967341/women-custom-bike-builders/\">who build custom bikes on designing bikes for women</a>.</li><li>A lovely <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/gallery-van-vleutens-second-flanders-win-10-years-in-the-making/\">Flanders gallery</a> for your eyeballs. </li><li>A really <a href=\"https://derailleur.substack.com/p/if-you-blinked\">great piece of writing</a> on the women’s tour of Flanders.</li><li>Remember the face on the cover of Rouleur’s issue dedicated to women?

But scrolling the Hellbog Website of Despair this morning, I came across this. I guess it’s quite funny until you remember that women’s cycling is perennially overlooked when it comes to stats like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/https-bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-public-images-f3eb2f2c-60fd-4cb5-b8ef-1ce7c6045589_1220x520.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Listen <strong>🎧</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe I like the sound of my own voice (I don’t) or maybe I just genuinely think that even without my waffle, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/freewheeling-podcast-gracie-elvin-returns-to-discuss-the-tour-of-flanders/\">Freewheeling is a Really Great Podcast</a> about women’s cycling (it is). This one is a good-en with recently-retired pro Gracie Elvin as a guest talking all about life after the peloton and the TCA’s mentorship programme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get more of that sort of thing from the latest<a href=\"https://thecyclingpodcast.com/episodes/the-cycling-podcast-feminin\"> Cycling Podcast Feminin</a>, too.

High-end carbon road bikes have got nothing on this 1970s Raleigh, <a href=\"https://www.tatler.com/article/princess-diana-bicycle-auction\">expected to fetch around £20,000 at auction</a>. The reason? It belonged to Princess Diana. It’s going under the hammer three years after it last sold for £10,000, in 2018. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In striking parallel to the treatment of Meghan Markle (without the racism) it was dubbed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000tshn?at_custom4=0FC24CBE-97B2-11EB-804D-1D0816F31EAE&amp;at_campaign=64&amp;at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&amp;at_custom2=twitter&amp;at_medium=custom7&amp;at_custom3=%40BBCWomansHour\">the ‘shame bike’</a> by the tabloid press at the time after Buckingham Palace officials forced her to sell before marrying Prince Charles in 1981 as it was deemed an ‘inappropriate’ form of transport for a Royal. It’s being flogged as “a famous symbol of Diana’s oppression” which is quite grotesque, tbh.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>That’s All 👋</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As ever, thanks for reading and for supporting women’s cycling and if you like what you see you can support WCW on <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/womenscyclingweekly\" target=\"_blank\">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a great weekend, albeit race-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until next time,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy x</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/womens-cycling-weekly-issue-20/\">Women’s Cycling Weekly: Issue 20</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Amy Jones","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ba1952d80e5351a250520875a447f5818a52d3578671c3c0ab93d8dc787c2d33","category":"Cycling"}
