Following <a href=\"https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2020-results\">a worse-than-expected earnings report released Tuesday night</a>, the company now has a market cap of just under $10 billion as of Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p>Sure, that's down roughly 18 percent from Tuesday's closing price, and off roughly 44 percent from a January peak that saw the stock offering become <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/\">a poster child for the retail investor-driven \"meme stock\" phenomenon</a>. Still there's not much in this week's report to suggest that GameStop as a company is worth ten times as much as it was just three months ago, much less the higher valuations it briefly enjoyed in the interim.</p>\n<h2>Signs of a turnaround?</h2>\n<p>Overall, GameStop's latest earnings report shows a company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/why-new-consoles-probably-wont-be-enough-to-save-gamestop/\">still struggling</a> to turn itself around. For the full fiscal year, the company lost $215 million on net, improving on a net loss of just over $470 million the year prior. Net sales for the year were down over 21 percent, to $5.09 billion, a decline GameStop blamed in part on its \"de-densification efforts\" (i.e. closing nearly 700 stores). Even taking that move into account, though, sales for comparable stores were down 9.5 percent for the year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751901#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751901&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34fd50cd4315879f5142d98dbbc4359f10e315def9cfc5ea4036567bf16b687d","category":"Tech"}
