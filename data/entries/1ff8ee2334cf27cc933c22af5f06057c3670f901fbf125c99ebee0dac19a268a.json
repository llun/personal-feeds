There are dozens of fake &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Duo chargers out there that consumers need to watch out for.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5TQZPl_YU6I\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nOver on our YouTube channel, <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan took a look at some fake &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging options that are floating around, comparing them to the real thing.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers can charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, 12 Pro, or 12 Pro Max at up to 15W, and the 12 mini at up to 12W. These charging speeds are limited to genuine Apple &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories created by Apple and those that use certified &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; technology like Belkin. Any other charger, including the fake &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Duo and fake &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; that we show off in the video, maxes out at right around 7.5W, so buying a fake charger might seem like a good idea to save some money, but you're not going to get &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; speeds.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis also goes for all of the \"magnetic\" charging accessories that third-party companies are introducing for the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; lineup. These magnetic accessories are able to use the magnets in the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; models to attach to the back of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> quickly, but charging speeds on anything not officially &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; is limited to 7.5W so far.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's nothing wrong with these third-party magnetic charging accessories so long as you're aware of the charging limitations, which companies don't always make clear. Magnetic accessories are basically identical to Qi-based chargers and the magnetic connection is handy, so if you don't mind slower charging speeds, you can save some money not going with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhat you'll want to avoid is anything that's modeled directly after a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger from Apple and anything that actively uses the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; name that's not certified, as these are fake, not going to charge at the proper &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; speeds, and could be unsafe. Make sure to watch our video to see these fakes in action, and keep an eye out for them when making a purchase so you don't get hoodwinked with slow charging speeds.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/fake-magsafe-accessories/\">Fake MagSafe Accessories Might Be a Bargain, But Watch Out for Shortcomings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fake-magsafe-accessories-might-be-a-bargain-but-watch-out-for-shortcomings.2290005/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KuInNxOCu4w:S6ycfUANjuc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KuInNxOCu4w:S6ycfUANjuc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KuInNxOCu4w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1ff8ee2334cf27cc933c22af5f06057c3670f901fbf125c99ebee0dac19a268a","category":"Apple"}
