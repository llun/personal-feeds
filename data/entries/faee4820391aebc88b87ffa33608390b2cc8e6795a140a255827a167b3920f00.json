{"title":"How to watch  La Course by Le Tour de France 2021: TV schedule, live streaming","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-watch-la-course/","date":1624442400000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2020/08/DSC_0744-1-7d26df7.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Brought forward by a day, the 2021 La Course will now take place on Saturday 26 June.</p>\n<p>The women’s one-day race was originally scheduled to take place on Sunday 27, but due to French local elections, La Course will take place on the same day as the opening stage of the men’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France 2021</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> La Course 2021 route profile.</span></figcaption><span> <i>La Course / ASO</i></span></div>\n<p>The route will take place between Brest and Landerneau. This is the same as the men’s race, but the women’s peloton will cover 107.7km compared to the men’s stage at 197.8km.</p>\n<p>The race features 1,800m of climbing with a 14km finishing circuit that the riders will take on three times. The circuit features the Côte de la Fosse aux Loups, a short, steep climb that is 3km in length and with an average gradient of 5.7 per cent.</p>\n<p>The 2020 edition of La Course was won by Lizzie Deignan, and the early 14 per cent sections of the Côte de la Fosse aux Loups will suit her style of riding.</p>\n<p>La Course has been a circuit race on the Champs-Elysées, a two-day race with a summit finish on the Col d’Izoard and a handicapped time trial, a mountains race between Annecy and Le Grand-Bornand, and a one-day race on circuits in Pau.</p>\n<p>Twenty-two teams are set to start La Course 2021, four of which feature past winners.</p>\n<p>The new Jumbo-Visma team expects to bring two-time winner Marianne Vos. She won Amstel Gold and Gent-Wevelgem earlier this year from reduced sprints, standing her in good stead for a third victory.</p>\n<p>Lizzie Deignan hasn’t enjoyed the same form this year, but her teammate Elisa Longo Borghini, the Italian National Road Champion, could be a contender having finished sixth last year.</p>\n<h2>TV schedule: how to watch La Course live in the UK</h2>\n<p>Eurosport 1 will be showing La Course by Le Tour de France live from 07:00-10:45.
