For other types of headphones, you may need to manually select the Always On option.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/apple-music-spatial-settings.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA separate section offers options for Lossless Audio, where you can turn the higher-quality audio files on and then choose from more granular options to specify what quality of music files your device should use when streaming over cellular, streaming over Wi-Fi, or downloading music.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/apple-music-spatial-labels.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Music app, you'll also be able to see which albums support Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio, thanks to new labels in the album details sections.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGobel/status/1402077066472853504\">Thanks, @JGobel!</a>)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-available/\">Apple Music Now Rolling Out Support for Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-now-rolling-out-support-for-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio.2299719/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TGUJANoSTkk:9ljA7BMko0o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TGUJANoSTkk:9ljA7BMko0o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/TGUJANoSTkk\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"11e8e2db9c027f8746bfe8a47d118b6743d4caf50476560db18ba5a4982d0428","category":"Apple"}
