One of the most striking new changes, according to Prosser, will be flat edges. Current Apple Watches feature curved edges, much like previous generation iPhones. However, with the iPhone 12, Apple reverted to flat edges and is even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/macbook-pro-copy-iphone-design/\">expected to do so for the upcoming MacBook Pro redesign</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the flat edges, Apple will include a new green color case option. Prosser says Apple has been testing \"experimental colors\" and that the green color option is not entirely set in stone. Prosser says that Apple could offer the Apple Watch 7 in a variety of additional colors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/prosser-green-apple-watch.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs he has done for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/14/prosser-airtags-design-likely-announced-tomorrow/\">AirTags</a> and AirPods Max, Prosser shared renders for the upcoming watch, which he claims are based on real-life images and CAD files he has seen from a source. Prosser says the screen size and display will remain the same but notes that he has heard that Apple has tested Apple Watch prototypes with smaller bezels and a larger display. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nProsser adds that he has only seen the design of the upcoming watch, not the specifications, which would include whether the watch will feature new sensors and health capabilities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been rumored to be working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/apple-watch-blood-pressure-glucose-alcohol/\">blood glucose and blood pressure</a> monitoring for future Apple Watches. With the Series 6, Apple introduced Blood Oxygen tracking and previously added ECG functionality with the Apple Watch Series 4. Apple is likely to continue to push the health features on the watch, but what exactly that will entail with the Series 7 remains unknown. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's also worth noting that Prosser says his source cannot confidently say that this specific Apple Watch design is the Series 7 and that it could even be the Apple Watch Series 8, destined for 2022. However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/14/kuo-no-120hz-iphone-12/\">had previously reported that the 2021 Apple Watch would see a redesign</a>, pushing Prosser to label this design as the upcoming Apple Watch. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">Prosser: Apple Watch Series 7 to Feature Flat-Edged Design, New Green Color Option</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-to-feature-flat-edged-design-new-green-color-option.2296803/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=elPLn9Z_QDA:agHVnGP0W2U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=elPLn9Z_QDA:agHVnGP0W2U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/elPLn9Z_QDA\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8dec439eaea14ddbd9a72b3102db10272521cbd1008f58fdfc513907cab306c2","category":"Apple"}
