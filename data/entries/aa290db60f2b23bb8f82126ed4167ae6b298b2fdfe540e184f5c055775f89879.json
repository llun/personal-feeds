The parachute deployed; the skycrane rockets fired. Robot truck goes <em>ping!</em> Perseverance, a rover built by humans to do science 128 million miles away, is wheels-down on Mars. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-lands-the-perseverance-rover-on-mars/\">Phew</a>.</p>\n<p>Percy has now opened its many eyes and taken a look around.</p>\n<p>The rover is studded with a couple dozen cameras—25, if you count the two on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/a-helicopter-ride-over-mars-nasas-about-to-give-it-a-shot/\">drone helicopter</a>.
