The lack of a perch didn’t slow Gaviria down too much, though, as he still crossed the line in 5th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finish line shots show a seatpost with no saddle attached as Gaviria sprinted down the straight run-in to the finish. He appears to be seated as late as 500 meters to go, as he followed leadout man Max Richeze around a late chicane before bursting up the left side of the road, followed closely by eventual stage winner Giacomo Nizzolo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaviria has had a rough go of it this Giro, frequently close but still without a stage win. He finished second on stage 10, fifth on stage five and again today. His best shot at victory appeared in stage two, but a miscommunication with his leadout left him boxed in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s been chasing the sprinter’s jersey currently held by Peter Sagan and managed to take a few points back both at the finish and at the day’s intermediate sprint. He sits in 4th in that competition, with 110 points to Sagan’s 135. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll update this story when we find out what happened to Gaviria’s poor saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/gaviria-sprints-to-5th-without-a-saddle/\">Gaviria sprints to 5th without a saddle</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"822eac665700670b506ab3eefa14e2e667e2acf352a4e3e90ee0abd6c4ab23b9","category":"Cycling"}
