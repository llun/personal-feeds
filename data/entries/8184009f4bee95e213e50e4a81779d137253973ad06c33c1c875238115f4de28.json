Co-producer Deborah Snyder has said <em>Army of Thieves</em> will be a standalone film and compared the \"romantic comedy heist\" to 2003's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Italian_Job_(2003_film)\"><em>The Italian Job</em></a> (itself a remake of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_PX1cVuaVA\">1969 British film</a>).</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Dead\">Army of the Dead</a></em> followed Dave Bautista and his team of mercenaries as they ventured into zombie-infested Las Vegas to recover millions in cash from a casino vault. Naturally, brain-munching carnage ensued. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/review-zombie-heist-thriller-army-of-the-dead-is-zack-snyder-at-his-best/\">I wrote in my review</a>, \"While Snyder's distinctive directorial style is plainly evident, he has reined in his worst impulses to give us a clever, entertaining twist on the zombie apocalypse, featuring all the flesh-eating carnage one expects from the genre.\" </p>\n<p>Bautista received top billing as Scott Ward, who brings the team together for the Vegas heist in hopes of having something to leave his estranged daughter, Kate (Ella Purnel). But the entire ensemble cast was terrific. In addition to Tig Notaro's delightfully cynical pilot and Samantha Win's martial arts fireworks, viewers loved the dynamic between zombie-killing-machine Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick) and the brilliantly nerdy, high-strung German safecracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer). Not only did the two forge a believable (albeit reluctant) bond, Dieter's well-timed high-pitched screams whenever a zombie charged was one of several running gags. So naturally Dieter is getting his own prequel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778641#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778641&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8184009f4bee95e213e50e4a81779d137253973ad06c33c1c875238115f4de28","category":"Tech"}
