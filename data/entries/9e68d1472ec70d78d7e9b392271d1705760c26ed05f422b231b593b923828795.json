The new service “hasn’t gotten off the ground,” according to the report, but Apple is currently testing the program with employees in Cupertino. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has reportedly taken over clinics in California to test the concept. However, the Journal reports that the initiative is struggling as “employees have raised questions internally about the integrity of health data coming from the company’s clinics that has been used to support product development.” Additionally, engagement has been low, with patients reportedly not engaging with the apps Apple offers to complement the care.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 6</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-press-100858143-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234682/apple-watch-series-6-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$319.99 at Amazon</a> | <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch&amp;subid1=1-1-348943-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$399 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>Health care has been a major undertaking for Apple under Tim Cook’s leadership, with the Apple Watch gaining sensors and features to promote fitness and wellness and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232692/tim-cook-on-apple-values-regulation-excessive-phone-use-health-and-more.html\">the CEO saying in 2019</a> that “there will be a day we look back and say Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind has been in healthcare.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Apple’s legacy is the Apple Watch, the Journal says. While Apple hasn’t abandoned its primary-care ambitions, it has “shifted the focus of its health unit” to selling devices. Just last week, Apple launched <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348123/ios-15-features-facetime-notifications-sharing-live-text-icloud-compatilibity-release-beta-how-to-install.html\">iOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348209/watchos-8-features-wallet-mindfulness-contacts-portraits-face-compatilibity-release-beta-how-to-install.html\">watchOS 8</a>, which include several health-related advancements, including new ways to share data with healthcare providers and trend analysis, as well as new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234585/apple-fitness-plus-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Fitness+ classes</a> and sleeping respiratory rate tracking.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9e68d1472ec70d78d7e9b392271d1705760c26ed05f422b231b593b923828795","category":"Apple"}
