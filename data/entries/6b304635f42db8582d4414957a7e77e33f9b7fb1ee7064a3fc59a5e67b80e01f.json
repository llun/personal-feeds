The new Nano II line is available in 30W, 45W, and 65W versions, and Anker says it has improved the chips and internal layout of its chargers to deliver greater efficiency while generating less heat.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/anker-nano-ii-series.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091DS2M8X\">30-watt charger</a> measures in at just 31.5 mm by 30.4 mm and about 38 mm deep. (The UK versions of all three chargers are about 1.5 mm deeper due to their prong design.) It can fast-charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and even fully support the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T5QVTKW\">45-watt version</a> offers a bit more power to be able to charge a wider variety of notebooks and other gadgets, and it measures 37.7 mm by 35 mm by about 41 mm. It also features foldable prongs to make it less likely to be damaged or to damage other items when tossed in together.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T5QN2TR\">65-watt version</a> can fully power devices all the way up to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and it too features foldable prongs. The charger measures 41.7 mm by 36 mm by about 44 mm.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll three chargers are available for preorder on Amazon and <a href=\"https://www.anker.com\">Anker.com</a> for US customers, priced at $29.99, $35.99, and $39.99 respectively. Versions for UK and EU customers will be available at a later date.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anker/\">Anker</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/anker-nano-ii-chargers/\">Anker's Nano II USB-C Chargers Pack Up to 65W of Power in a Smaller Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ankers-nano-ii-usb-c-chargers-pack-up-to-65w-of-power-in-a-smaller-design.2297595/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PTTkFXbh_GQ:mmTIKBXCmwg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PTTkFXbh_GQ:mmTIKBXCmwg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PTTkFXbh_GQ\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b304635f42db8582d4414957a7e77e33f9b7fb1ee7064a3fc59a5e67b80e01f","category":"Apple"}
