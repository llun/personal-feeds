The new devices aren't revolutionary by any means, but they could give a glimpse at the sorts of new offerings we can expect from companies like Lenovo moving forward. That remote-work emphasis is likely to guide product development for a while to come.</p>\n<p>The new Lenovo Go USB-C Laptop Power Bank is a portable charger with a 20,000 mAh capacity capable of delivering power at 65 watts. It can charge up to three devices simultaneously, either wirelessly or wired.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764990#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764990&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e494b57ee37cb7992e81082f51cd434b2a7cf6175554320b33202ec151d037f","category":"Tech"}
