The press release announcing the roster did not offer many clues on that front either, with team principal Dave Brailsford instead hinting that the team plans to ride an active race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We won’t win this Tour by sitting in the wheels. We have the team to make it a racers’ race, take the initiative, seize every opportunity and make our opposition focus for every kilometer of every stage,” Brailsford said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have changed our race philosophy this season to being more open and aggressive. Our performances have built all season and a joy of racing has infused the whole team. This more adventurous approach has led us to fearless racing and this is exactly how we will hit the Tour. We will seek out every moment in every stage where the race is on and try to exploit it. Key for us this Tour is our collective strength and camaraderie to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Expect the unexpected.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/the-ineos-grenadiers-unveil-their-tour-de-france-squad/\">The Ineos Grenadiers unveil their Tour de France squad</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"09436f26533ae6626b56040ac8a42a016f74381e41c4bf5844ea832fca44d15d","category":"Cycling"}
