{"title":"Luna Display's Mac-to-Mac Display Feature Now Works Over Ethernet and Thunderbolt","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/luna-display-mac-to-mac-thunderbolt-ethernet/","date":1620245662000,"content":"Astropad's Luna Display accessory that's able to turn an old <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or Mac into a secondary display for a primary Mac was today updated with a new feature that's designed to allow Mac-to-Mac mode to work over Ethernet and Thunderbolt.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Luna Display is an alternative to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sidecar/\">Sidecar</a>, allowing an ‌iPad‌ to be used as a display for a Mac. Unlike ‌Sidecar‌, it works with other Macs, so you can use one Mac as a display for another Mac, something that's always been useful with machines like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith a new 4.5 software update that's available today, the Luna Display can work with two Macs connected by Ethernet or Thunderbolt, which improves the Mac-to-Mac mode experience for users who have poor WiFi connectivity or would prefer to work with a wired connection. Prior to today's update, Mac-to-Mac mode was limited to the Luna Display's wireless connection.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new software update brings other features including a battery indicator for a secondary device, secondary Mac keyboard enhancements, improved Retina support on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs, and for iPads, better compatibility with the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Astropad, Mac-to-Mac mode is an ideal alternative to Target Display Mode, a feature that Apple used to offer for older iMacs. Target Display Mode allowed an ‌iMac‌ to be connected to another Mac, with the ‌iMac‌ then serving as a display, but that functionality does not work with modern Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Luna Display allows an ‌iMac‌ to be used as a display for another Mac, but technically, it works with any two Mac combinations, so you can pair up two MacBooks, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> and a MacBook, or anything else.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Luna Display is priced at $100 and can be <a href=\"https://shop.astropad.com/collections/luna-display-mac-and-pc\">purchased from the Astropad website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luna-display/\">Luna Display</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/luna-display-mac-to-mac-thunderbolt-ethernet/\">Luna Display's Mac-to-Mac Display Feature Now Works Over Ethernet and Thunderbolt</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/luna-displays-mac-to-mac-display-feature-now-works-over-ethernet-and-thunderbolt.2294973/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BTAwLwa4R-k:1qlLCzNrviw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BTAwLwa4R-k:1qlLCzNrviw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BTAwLwa4R-k\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"682e714ac78253357d8f566012815ea236ad5a0f5b1f83ba8ca7c4fa5be2035b","category":"Apple"}
