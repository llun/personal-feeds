But to do it twice in the space of 18 months and get my first Guinness World Record? That will be pretty special, and that is exactly what I plan on doing.'</p>\n<p>To find out more about Quigley visit <a href=\"https://www.joshquigley92.com/\" target=\"_blank\">joshquigley92.com</a> and to donate to his fundraiser visit <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/joshquigley7daycyclingworldrecord\" target=\"_blank\">justgiving.com/fundraising/joshquigley7daycyclingworldrecord</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"915fc79706b475e51fab7db8fcf8a123a0577df45d798ca484e481ac7c3f1d5b","category":"Cycling"}
