A quick review of Gab’s open source code shows that the critical vulnerability—or at least one very much like it—was introduced by the company’s chief technology officer.</p>\n<p>The change, which in the parlance of software development is known as a “git commit,” was made sometime in February from the account of Fosco Marotto, a former Facebook software engineer who in November <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210207211220/https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/11/18/free-speech-platform-gab-announces-facebook-vet-as-technical-chief/\">became Gab’s CTO</a>. On Monday, Gab removed the <a href=\"https://code.gab.com/gab/social/gab-social/-/commit/fb3b7545705153022c24bb072fbdb3925b8cbfeb\">git commit</a> from its website.

Specifically, line 23 strips the code of “reject” and “filter,” which are API functions that implement <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_idiom\">programming idioms</a> that protect against SQL injection attacks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746422#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746422&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"33058d02236b907cbcd0b307fae0e750125bb44baf30fe46dfd30beec4d2d1f0","category":"Tech"}
