Fitness+ Audio Meditations appears to be the next Apple Watch Fitness+ audio experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFitness+ Audio Meditations may allow Apple to begin to compete with popular existing guided meditation apps such as Headspace, and could help users learn to meditate through spoken instructions and sound.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn watchOS 8, Apple has renamed the Breathe app \"Mindfulness,\" refocusing it around short meditation practices, tips, and thought-provoking themes. The app has been overhauled with new animations and visualizations, a new summary screen, and other general improvements.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the fact that Apple has hastily attempted to remove the first look at Fitness+ Audio Meditations, it is likely that the feature is being kept back for a formal announcement at a later date, perhaps prior to the public release of watchOS 8.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Jake!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/breathe/\">Breathe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/\">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-mac-tvos-watchos-programming.135\">iOS, Mac, tvOS, watchOS Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/apple-accidentally-leaks-fitness-audio-meditations/\">Apple Accidentally Leaks Fitness+ Audio Meditations for Apple Watch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-accidentally-leaks-fitness-audio-meditations-for-apple-watch.2300241/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wEgoPMRRMaQ:-gGRqpbs6UQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wEgoPMRRMaQ:-gGRqpbs6UQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wEgoPMRRMaQ\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2b674cd72e15896df86e0373d28e60c91f2c7952e04a8e2a0300690f2783cbd4","category":"Apple"}
