But if you need a new Mac or iPad now, you don’t need to wait. Here are the best deals we can find and be sure to check back once Prime Day begins on Monday, June 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/airpods-max-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Jason Cross/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular earbuds around, especially if you’re an Apple Music subscriber. There are three different models—<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a>—and we’ve given them all stellar reviews. There’s a strong possibility that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/new-airpods-2020-3780443/\">a new model is on the way</a>, but the current models are fantastic at any price.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods with Wireless Charging Case:</strong> $150 ($50 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods with Wired Charging Case:</strong> $120 ($40 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods Pro:</strong> $197 ($52 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-New-AirPods-Max/dp/B08PZJN7BD?th=1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>AirPods Max (Blue):</strong> $499 ($50 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple-watch-series-6.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Michael Simon/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will release a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348953/2021-apple-watch-series-7-watchos-8-design-display-colors-processor-features-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> in the fall, but we highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234682/apple-watch-series-6-review.html\">the current Series 6</a> in any color (though we’re partial to red and blue). The flagship Apple Watch has a blood-oxygen sensor, EKG sensor, and an always-on display, along with a gorgeous design. It’s pricey, but if you can grab it for less we recommend it over the SE or Series 3 models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm):</strong> $320 ($79 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm):</strong> $359 ($70)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5R3K3Q/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm w/Cellular): </strong>$429 ($70 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5FXJN7/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm w/Cellular):</strong> $445 ($84 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ipad-air-2020.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Jason Cross/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345539/11-inch-ipad-pro-vs-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-m1-ram-liquid-retina-xdr-display-storage-price-accessories.html\">newest iPad Pro </a>probably won’t be on sale yet in any significant way, but we highly recommend the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/2021-mac-mini-design-processor-m1x-gpu-ram-storage-price-release.html\">iPad Air</a>, which has a similar design, processor, and functionality for a lot less than the flagship model. The entry-level model is also a solid deal at less than $300. We don’t recommend the iPad mini at this time since there could be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348867/ipad-mini-apple-processor-design-price-release-html.html\">a dramatic redesign</a> on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J9699/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>10.2-inch iPad (8th generation):</strong> $299 ($30 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J93K6ZC?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>iPad Air (Blue): </strong>$549 ($50 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/macbook-pro-touchbar-2019.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s M1 Macs are fast and incredible, so we recommend getting one over any other Intel Mac. There are <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-sd-card-reader-magsafe-price-release.html\">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models on the way</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/2021-mac-mini-design-processor-m1x-gpu-ram-storage-price-release.html\">a new Mac mini</a>, but you can’t go wrong with one of the current M1 models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M7S6K/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>MacBook Air (M1, 7-core GPU, 256GB): </strong>$949 ($50 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MacBook-Pro-Apple-M1-Chip/dp/B08N7NV2KB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 256GB): </strong>$1,150 ($149 off)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MacBook-Pro-Apple-M1-Chip/dp/B08N5LH3F7?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>13-inch MacBook Pro (M1, 512GB):</strong> $1,299 ($200 off with automatic discount at checkout)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2020-Apple-Mini-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>Mac mini (M1, 256GB): </strong>$599 ($100 off with automatic discount at checkout)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-24-inch-8%E2%80%91core-7%E2%80%91core-256GB/dp/B0932FPBV8?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><strong>24-inch iMac (M1, 7-core GPU, 256GB):</strong> $1,249 ($50 off)</a></p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d24c45913aeacabf54b7e5bf1817fb01a49b100d954af3358dd709934991f639","category":"Apple"}
