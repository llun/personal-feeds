But that's because Apple's exorbitant 30% tax on new subscriptions forced us to turn off in-app purchases in 2016. It made more business sense to cut ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users off from a path to subscriptions than to absorb the 30% cut for new ones.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nGutierrez points out the many regulatory issues that Apple is facing in Europe and the United States. The European Commission <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/apple-in-breach-of-eu-competition-law/\">in April found</a> that Apple breached EU competition law with ‌Apple Music‌, and in April, the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/airtags-release-app-store-antitrust-hearing/\">questioned Apple's App Store policies</a>. Spotify, Tile, and others attended the latter hearing and said that if Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules aren't changed, Apple will take over the internet, \"limiting innovation, squashing small businesses, and all but eliminating customer choice.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotify is asking the U.S. to speed up its regulatory initiatives against Apple with \"urgent, narrowly tailored updates\" to antitrust law to \"end such egregious abuses.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGutierrez says that Spotify isn't asking for special treatment, but wants \"fair treatment,\" and he sums up his piece by stating that Apple's \"ability to strangle its competitors is unprecedented.\" He says that those in a position \"to do something\" have now \"seen past Apple's facade\" and are now acting on the behalf of \"innovators and consumers around the world.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/spotify-apple-strangle-competitors/\">Spotify Legal Chief: 'Apple's Ability to Strangle its Competitors is Unprecedented'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-legal-chief-apples-ability-to-strangle-its-competitors-is-unprecedented.2296687/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cbD03mhUrIQ:0WhfpMCz7SY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cbD03mhUrIQ:0WhfpMCz7SY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cbD03mhUrIQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"191f1ff88ca6f8c71263131e72b0fe89574c8f4a54bace9a087f556e4bc33ef4","category":"Apple"}
