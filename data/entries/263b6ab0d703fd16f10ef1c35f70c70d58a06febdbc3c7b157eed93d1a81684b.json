Rumors suggest the updated tablets could feature Thunderbolt connectivity, improved camera technology, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/2021-ipad-pro-fewer-speaker-holes-rumor/\">fewer speaker holes</a>, and a mini-LED display for the 12.9-inch model.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/ios-14-5-beta-4-a14x-chip-ipad-pro/\">iOS 14.5 Beta 5 References Unreleased &#039;A14X&#039; Chip Rumored for iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-14-5-beta-5-references-unreleased-a14x-chip-rumored-for-ipad-pro.2289384/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_86rdAfdgqs:YjIh9Rn6QKQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_86rdAfdgqs:YjIh9Rn6QKQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_86rdAfdgqs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"263b6ab0d703fd16f10ef1c35f70c70d58a06febdbc3c7b157eed93d1a81684b","category":"Apple"}
