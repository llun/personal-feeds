{"title":"Deals: Apple's MagSafe Charger Hits New Low Price at $29.85 ($9 Off)","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/deals-apples-magsafe-charger/","date":1620651899000,"content":"Amazon today has dropped the price of Apple's MagSafe Charger to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$29.85</strong></a>, down from $39.00. The previous best sale for the accessory was priced at $34.00 over the past few weeks, so Amazon's new deal is an all-time low price for the MagSafe Charger. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafethumb.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

It's also compatible for wireless charging with iPhone models dating back to the iPhone 8. It has an attached USB-C cable, but it doesn't come with a 20W USB-C Power Adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$9 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for $29.85</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's other MagSafe accessory, the MagSafe Duo Charger, also remains on sale this week. You can get this dual-purpose device for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWR2NXZ?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$112.45</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $129.00. The MagSafe Duo provides charging to both a Qi-compatible iPhone and an Apple Watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWR2NXZ?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$16 OFF</div>MagSafe Duo Charger for $112.45</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've seen the MagSafe Duo Charger go down to as low as $99.00 in previous sales at Best Buy, but that sale hasn't ever returned. Amazon's offer today is the second-best price that we've tracked, and it's a solid discount for those interested in purchasing the accessory soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBe sure to visit our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to shop for even more Apple-related products and accessories.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/deals-apples-magsafe-charger/\">Deals: Apple's MagSafe Charger Hits New Low Price at $29.85 ($9 Off)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-apples-magsafe-charger-hits-new-low-price-at-29-85-9-off.2295558/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rIvGaps8ATg:VwYNVYBRF3s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rIvGaps8ATg:VwYNVYBRF3s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rIvGaps8ATg\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e1d09f768832bdb3a3cdc345e0b2a4bb483f0476663720a07e6b85e7996eaa8f","category":"Apple"}
