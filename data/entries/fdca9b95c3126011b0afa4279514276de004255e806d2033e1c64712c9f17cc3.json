The Bahrain Victorious leader was forced to abandon the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> after crashing heavily with just over 4 km remaining in a chaotic stage 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haig fell on a sweeping, downhill left-hander and spent some time lying on the road as he received medical attention. He later went and sat by the roadside before being taken to Hospital Centre Bretagne.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Crash by Haig, Demare<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TDF2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TDF2021</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WBeqve3pH7\">pic.twitter.com/WBeqve3pH7</a></p>— Jan Willems (@CyclingWiz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CyclingWiz/status/1409533289283588100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 28, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>“Jack suffered a fractured left collarbone and concussion following the crash,” Bahrain Victorious doctor Piotr Kosielski said in a team press release. “He is conscious and OK and scans showed no head trauma. He will remain in hospital overnight for observation following the team and UCI protocols.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haig’s GC campaign had started in promising fashion. Despite hitting the deck in a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/21-riders-were-injured-on-stage-1-of-the-tour-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\">crash-marred opening stage</a> Haig managed to finish in fourth place on the day – second highest among the GC contenders, with only Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) ahead of him. On stage 2 Haig finished in 10th place, leaving him in sixth on GC by day’s end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 27-year-old will now have to wait for another opportunity to fight for GC at a Grand Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>🏥 Team Doctor Piotr Kosielski: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackhaig93?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jackhaig93</a> suffered a fractured left collarbone and concussion.

In addition to Haig himself leaving the race, Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers), Richie Porte (Ineos Grenadiers), Roglič, and Tadej Pogačar have all lost footing in the GC battle due to crashes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haig is due to represent Australia in the Olympic road race in Tokyo on July 24. It’s not yet clear what impact his injuries will have on that plan.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/jack-haig-out-of-the-tour-with-broken-collarbone-and-concussion/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"fdca9b95c3126011b0afa4279514276de004255e806d2033e1c64712c9f17cc3","category":"Cycling"}
