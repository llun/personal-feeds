Now, Moxie Marlinspike—the brainchild behind the Signal messaging app—has turned the tables.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Marlinspike <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/\">published a post</a> that reported vulnerabilities in Cellebrite software that allowed him to execute malicious code on the Windows computer used to analyze a device. The researcher and software engineer exploited the vulnerabilities by loading specially formatted files that can be embedded into any app installed on the device.</p>\n<h2>Virtually no limits</h2>\n<p>“There are virtually no limits on the code that can be executed,” Marlinspike wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759092#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759092&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0afaac586620f3867856dee9d12e355b918beea6fa8b9ba239e795888094acd5","category":"Tech"}
