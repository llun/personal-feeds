The new device is an M.2 2280 format drive, using QLC (Quad Level Cell) NAND storage running behind an Optane cache layer.</p>\n<p>This isn't Intel's first try at an Optane-backed hybrid SSD—the first, 2019's <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/memory-storage/optane-memory/optane-memory-h10-solid-state-storage.html\">Optane H10</a>, made its way into a few consumer laptops but didn't make much of a splash. H20 is a second try, with a significantly improved QLC SSD and NAND controller.</p>\n<h2>What’s a QLC?</h2>\n<p>Conventional NAND SSDs store data by maintaining charge levels in individual cells aboard a solid-state medium. How much data each individual cell stores is configurable and has dramatic impact upon the cost, performance, and longevity of the NAND as a whole:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765707#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765707&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d257e593a1540ef51576e12456db0a55c9c98df0123c5b5e45cb42cafb6e7e8","category":"Tech"}
