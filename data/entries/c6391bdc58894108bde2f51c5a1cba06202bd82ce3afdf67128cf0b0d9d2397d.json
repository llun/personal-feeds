As <em><a href=\"https://the8-bit.com/airtags-hacked-for-first-time/\">The 8-Bit</a></em> notes:<blockquote>A microcontroller is an integrated circuit (IC) used for controlling devices usually via a microprocessing unit, memory, and other peripherals. According to AllAboutCircuits, \"these devices are optimized for embedded applications that require both processing functionality and agile, responsive interaction with digital, analog, or electromechanical components.\"</blockquote>Roth also shared a video comparing a normal AirTag to his modified device. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Built a quick demo: AirTag with modified NFC URL ðŸ˜Ž<br /><br />(Cables only used for power) <a href=\"https://t.co/DrMIK49Tu0\">pic.twitter.com/DrMIK49Tu0</a></p>â€” stacksmashing (@ghidraninja) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ghidraninja/status/1391165711448518658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nHow the hack might be exploited in the wild is unclear at this time, but the fact that it can be done may open up avenues for the jailbreaking community to customize the device in ways Apple didn't intend. On a darker note, it could also present opportunities for bad actors to modify the AirTag software for the purposes of phishing and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThat's assuming Apple isn't able to remotely block such a modified AirTag from communicating with the â€ŒFind Myâ€Œ network. Alternately, Apple might be able to lock down the firmware in a future AirTag software update.
