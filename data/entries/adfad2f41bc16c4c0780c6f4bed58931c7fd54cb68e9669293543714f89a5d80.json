While there are no major changes to WidgetKit this year, the new password-protected feature may be welcomed by apps that feature ‌widgets‌ with sensitive information, such as health and banking information. Widgets are accessible on the lock screen by swiping left to Today View.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRelated to ‌widgets‌ on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> is new functionality for Smart Stacks. Smart Stacks allows users to stack different ‌widgets‌ on top of each other and allowing iOS to determine which widget is most relevant to be shown depending on factors such as time of day, location, and more. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn ‌iOS 15‌, the system can now <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/ios-15-widget-suggestions-smart-stack/\">automatically add widgets to Smart Stacks</a> that it believes are relevant. The feature called Widget Suggestions is a new way for users to discover ‌widgets‌ they may not have known existed.
