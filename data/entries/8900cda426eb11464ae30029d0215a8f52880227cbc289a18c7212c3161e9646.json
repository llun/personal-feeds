Samsung stays atop the sales charts on the strength of its midrange smartphones, and last year (at least for some quarters) the company's <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200513005773/en/Strategy-Analytics-Samsung-Galaxy-A51-is-Worlds-Bestselling-Android-Smartphone-Model-in-Q1-2020\">best-selling phone</a> was the Samsung Galaxy A51.</p>\n<p>So then: meet the <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/the-galaxy-a52-a52-5g-and-a72-make-innovation-accessible-to-all\">Galaxy A52</a>, the follow-up to Samsung's chart-topper. These phones are such a big deal now that Samsung held <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Tc8un6J40\">a presentation</a> for them, its third online show in as many months.</p>\n<table class=\"specifications\"><tbody><tr><th></th>\n<th>Galaxy A52</th>\n<th>Galaxy A52 5G</th>\n<th>Galaxy A72</th>\n</tr><tr><th>STARTING PRICE</th>\n<td>€348 (~$414)</td>\n<td>€429 (~$511)</td>\n<td>€449 (~$535)</td>\n</tr><tr><th>SCREEN</th>\n<td>90Hz, 6.5-inch 2400×1080 OLED</td>\n<td>120Hz 6.5-inch 2400×1080 OLED</td>\n<td>90Hz 6.7-inch 2400×1080 OLED</td>\n</tr><tr><th>CPU</th>\n<td>Snapdragon 720G<br>\n(two Cortex A76 cores,<br>\nsix A55 cores, 8nm)</td>\n<td>Snapdragon 750G<br>\n(two Cortex A77 cores,<br>\nsix A55 cores, 8nm)</td>\n<td>Snapdragon 720G<br>\n(two Cortex A76 cores,<br>\nsix A55 cores, 8nm)</td>\n</tr><tr><th>RAM</th>\n<td>4GB, 6GB, or 8GB</td>\n<td>6GB or 8GB</td>\n<td>6GB or 8GB</td>\n</tr><tr><th>STORAGE</th>\n<td>128GB or 256GB</td>\n<td>128GB or 256GB</td>\n<td>128GB or 256GB</td>\n</tr><tr><th>CAMERA</th>\n<td>64 MP Main<br>\n12 MP Wide-angle<br>\n5 MP Macro<br>\n5 MP Depth<br>\n32 MP Front</td>\n<td>64 MP Main<br>\n12 MP Wide-angle<br>\n5 MP Macro<br>\n5 MP Depth<br>\n32 MP Front</td>\n<td>64 MP Main<br>\n12 MP Wide-angle<br>\n5 MP Macro<br>\n8 MP 3X Telephoto<br>\n32 MP Front</td>\n</tr><tr><th>BATTERY</th>\n<td>4500 mAh</td>\n<td>4500 mAh</td>\n<td>5000 mAh</td>\n</tr><tr><th>Other perks</th>\n<td colspan=\"3\">NFC, in-display fingerprint sensor, MicroSD slot, 25W wired charging, USB-C, IP67</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>There is a lot to talk about in this table. First, Samsung tossed in the Galaxy A72 in its presentation along with the A52. It's the most expensive phone out of the bunch, but I don't know why anyone would buy it if they have access to the A52 5G, which has a faster display and faster SoC. The A72 has a slightly bigger battery, but it also has a bigger screen, so I'm not sure if that's going to result in significantly more runtime. Availability details are up in the air right now, so maybe regions would get either the A52 5G, or the A72 but not both? Speaking of availability, Samsung has only announced prices in euros, so for now we only know these are headed for somewhere in Europe. Samsung will probably expand the rollout over time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750321#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750321&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8900cda426eb11464ae30029d0215a8f52880227cbc289a18c7212c3161e9646","category":"Tech"}
