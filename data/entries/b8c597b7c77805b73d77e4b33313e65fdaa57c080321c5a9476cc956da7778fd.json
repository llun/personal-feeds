He died far too young from a complication of diabetes. Here’s a delightful story from his youth:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>His childhood paralleled the 1983 movie “War Games,” in which a\nteenager, played by Matthew Broderick, unwittingly accesses a U.S.\nmilitary supercomputer. When Mr. Kaminsky was 11, his mother said,\nshe received an angry phone call from someone who identified\nhimself as a network administrator for the Western United States.\nThe administrator said someone at her residence was “monkeying\naround in territories where he shouldn’t be monkeying around.”</p>\n\n<p>Without her knowledge, Mr. Kaminsky had been examining military\nwebsites. The administrator vowed to “punish” him by cutting off\nthe family’s internet access. Mrs. Maurer warned the administrator\nthat if he made good on his threat, she would take out an\nadvertisement in The San Francisco Chronicle denouncing the\nPentagon’s security.</p>\n\n<p>“I will take out an ad that says, ‘Your security is so crappy,\neven an 11-year-old can break it,’” Mrs. Maurer recalled telling\nthe administrator, in an interview on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>They settled on a compromise punishment: three days without\ninternet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now that’s a good mom.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/27/kaminsky\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b8c597b7c77805b73d77e4b33313e65fdaa57c080321c5a9476cc956da7778fd","category":"Tech"}
