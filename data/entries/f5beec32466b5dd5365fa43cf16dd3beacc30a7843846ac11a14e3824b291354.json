{"title":"Deals: Shop for AirPods Pro at $197 ($52 Off) and Regular AirPods at $129 ($30 Off) in Amazon's New Sales","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/deals-shop-for-airpods-pro/","date":1618842809000,"content":"New markdowns on Apple's AirPods and AirPods Pro have emerged to kick off the week, with up to $52 in savings on the Bluetooth headphones. If you're shopping for the AirPods Pro, it's still a solid time to buy this version of Apple's wireless headphones, now priced at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$197.00</strong></a>, down from $249.00.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/AirPods-Combo-Discount-Feature-Duo.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis price is beating the typical Amazon sale by $2, and it's the best sale currently available at a major Apple reseller online this week. Steeper discounts on the AirPods Pro have been rare this spring, and we haven't seen a drop to $189.99 at Woot since early March.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$52 OFF</div>AirPods Pro for $197.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nToday's sale brings the Amazon price closer to Woot's, and it's a notable offer for anyone hoping to purchase the noise-canceling headphones soon. The AirPods Pro are ready to ship today, and they're sold directly from Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the lower-cost model, Amazon also has the AirPods with Wired Charging Case for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$129.00</strong></a>, down from $159.00. We've seen this model drop to $109-$119 in the past, but this is another example of rare sales that haven't reemerged very often since their popularity earlier in 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$30 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for $129.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of spring 2021, the last steep discount on the AirPods with Wired Charging Case at Amazon was in the first week of March, priced at $119.00. It's hard to say when we'll see a return of these prices, so if you're shopping for gifts for Mother's Day or anything else and need to purchase them soon, Amazon's sale today is still a good offer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/deals-shop-for-airpods-pro/\">Deals: Shop for AirPods Pro at $197 ($52 Off) and Regular AirPods at $129 ($30 Off) in Amazon's New Sales</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-shop-for-airpods-pro-at-197-52-off-and-regular-airpods-at-129-30-off-in-amazons-new-sales.2292206/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UCMbvWswGrU:0yWaThBiG9g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UCMbvWswGrU:0yWaThBiG9g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UCMbvWswGrU\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f5beec32466b5dd5365fa43cf16dd3beacc30a7843846ac11a14e3824b291354","category":"Apple"}
