Apple and Microsoft had a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/\">brief moment of contention</a> in August of last year as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> policy restricts services like xCloud from being available on the platform. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/11/apple-updates-app-store-review-guidelines/\">updated its policy</a> to allow xCloud onto the platform, but it would require Microsoft to submit each game available on the service individually to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and each would have to be vetted against the platforms guidelines.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMicrosoft blasted the rules as a \"bad experience for customers,\" and as a result, said it would push xCloud to iOS and iPadOS users via the browser on Safari. Screenshots provided to <em>The Verge</em> only show an xCloud experience via the browser on desktop, but the experience on iOS and iPadOS will likely be the same. Users will be able to select a game and play it directly within their browser; however, the exact resolution the game will be streamed at is as yet unknown. Typically, services like these will automatically adapt the resolution to meet your specific network capability.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/xcloudweb_2-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2640\" height=\"1485\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783649\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAt launch, xCloud will only support browsers built on Chromium like Edge and Chrome on the PC, but <em>The Verge</em>'s Senior Editor Tom Warren says that he expects support for Safari to be added following internal testing. With testing underway, there's no set timeframe when a public launch will take place, but <em>The Verge</em> guesses that a release is \"getting very close.\"<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xcloud/\">xCloud</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/microsoft-testing-xcloud-in-browser-for-ios-ipados/\">Microsoft Begins Testing xCloud Game Streaming Service in Browser for iOS and iPadOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-begins-testing-xcloud-game-streaming-service-in-browser-for-ios-and-ipados.2284766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QLe3p1xjiF8:kZpoEkgwYmo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QLe3p1xjiF8:kZpoEkgwYmo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QLe3p1xjiF8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4924bd9b4e1a04759fa4442474d1720156e140f95f6f77d3843b6dda83261a6e","category":"Apple"}
