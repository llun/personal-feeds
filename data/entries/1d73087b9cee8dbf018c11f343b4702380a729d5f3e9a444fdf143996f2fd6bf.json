This has been the  most consistent deal on the MagSafe Charger for the past few months.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$5 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for $34.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe MagSafe Charger magnetically aligns with the magnets in the iPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, and 12 mini. It's also compatible for wireless charging with iPhone models dating back to the iPhone 8. It has an attached USB-C cable, but it doesn't come with a 20W USB-C Power Adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's other MagSafe accessory, the MagSafe Duo Charger, also remains on sale this week. You can get this dual-purpose device for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWR2NXZ?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$112.45</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $129.00. The MagSafe Duo provides charging to both a Qi-compatible iPhone and an Apple Watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWR2NXZ?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$16 OFF</div>MagSafe Duo Charger for $112.45</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've seen the MagSafe Duo Charger go down to as low as $99.00 in previous sales at Best Buy, but that sale hasn't ever returned. Amazon's offer today is the second-best price that we've tracked, and it's a solid discount for those interested in purchasing the accessory soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMagSafe Duo launched in December 2020 and offers a ‌MagSafe‌ charging puck for the ‌iPhone 12‌, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, and 12 mini, along with an Apple Watch charger. The ‌MagSafe‌ Duo features a foldable design for easier portability, and it ships with a USB-C to Lightning cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBe sure to visit our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to shop for even more Apple-related products and accessories.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/deals-magsafe/\">Deals: Save on Apple's MagSafe Charger and MagSafe Duo Charger Accessories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-save-on-apples-magsafe-charger-and-magsafe-duo-charger-accessories.2297754/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7MgbUQp_k5I:HR-qjVWKfMo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7MgbUQp_k5I:HR-qjVWKfMo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7MgbUQp_k5I\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d73087b9cee8dbf018c11f343b4702380a729d5f3e9a444fdf143996f2fd6bf","category":"Apple"}
