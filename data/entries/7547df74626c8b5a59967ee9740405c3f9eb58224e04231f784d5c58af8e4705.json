Additional notches along the edges of the eyestay are said to provide even more flexibility so as to be more accommodating of different instep heights, and a more heavily reinforced heel counter promises a better hold.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bontrager-Circuit-road-shoes-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The updated upper material features TPU laminated over mesh.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being more flexible, the new upper material is supposedly more breathable, and it’s also augmented with an array of larger perforations relative to the previous Circuit. Up front, there’s a new sole vent under the toe, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-way adjustable Boa L6 dials carry over (albeit with updated dials), and Bontrager is also sticking with the inForm Race last for this model, which offers just a bit more breathing room around the midfoot and ball area relative to the brand’s most performance-oriented inForm Pro shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this is attached to a fiber-reinforced nylon “Bronze Series” plate — rated 7 out of 14 on Bontrager’s in-house stiffness scale — that works with both three-bolt and two-bolt cleats (as did the previous version). Two-bolt cleats require users to purchase the steel cleat insert separately, but it’s nice to see the extra versatility on tap, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bontrager-Circuit-road-shoes-7-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The fiber-reinforced nylon plate certainly isn’t the stiffest, lightest, or thinnest one Bontrager has in its catalog, but it gets the job done and is compatible with both three-hole and two-hole cleats.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Actual weight for a set of size 43 shoes is 555 grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bontrager is offering the new Circuit in five colors, and retail price has actually dropped slightly to US$135 (international pricing TBC) — meaning that these shoes have not only gotten better, but have also gotten more affordable, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that’s a trend I can really get behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bike-clothing/cycling-shoes/c/A207/\" target=\"_blank\">www.bontrager.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bontrager-Circuit-road-shoes-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Fabric lace guides are now used instead of the previous version’s hard plastic ones.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bontrager-Circuit-road-shoes-4-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Carrying over is the Boa L6 system, but with an updated dial.
