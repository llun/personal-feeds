The straps are also cut to force you into a crouch.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9442/la-passione-club-bibtights-photos#7\"><p><span>Image 8 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/la_passione_club_bibtights_8.jpg?itok=hoR01d7R\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 8 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Simple is always best</h3>\n<p>I’m no big fan of zipped ankle cuffs on my bibtights, so the elasticated cuff of the La Passione Club bibtights is a welcome feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.lapassione.cc/collections/mens-tights/products/club-winter-tights-blue\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the La Passione Club bibtights now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Given that – well, unless you’re the kind of person who wears their socks over their tights – there’s no contact between cuff and skin, there’s no need for silicone grippers, and the elasticated band is snug enough to prevent draughts.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9442/la-passione-club-bibtights-photos#8\"><p><span>Image 9 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/la_passione_club_bibtights_9.jpg?itok=jrC4Y28x\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 9 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Talking of simplicity, I’m a sucker for a solid colour, and these tights satisfy that desire, with the dark blue Club bibtights bearing just a few subtle white logos as well as reflective detailing.</p>\n<p>It’s a rare case of form and function in almost perfect harmony. The grey piping on the bib section, whilst invisible when riding, is another nice touch.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9442/la-passione-club-bibtights-photos#6\"><p><span>Image 7 of</span> 11</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/la_passione_club_bibtights_7.jpg?itok=R1B5bazQ\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 7 of </span>11</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>No clammy chamois</h3>\n<p>The Elastic Interface chamois of the La Passione Club bibtights is a particularly comfortable pad to sit on.
