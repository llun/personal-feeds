But GameStop's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/dont-look-now-but-gamestop-stock-is-approaching-record-highs-again/\">heavily inflated stock price</a> is down significantly in morning trading on news that the company plans to sell more shares and the announcement that it is cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the \"meme stock\" phenomenon.</p>\n<p>In what CEO George Sherman called a \"strong start to the year,\" GameStop's net sales were up over 25 percent to $1.3 billion in the fiscal quarter ending on April 30. That's despite \"a roughly 12 percent reduction in the global store fleet due to our strategic de-densification efforts and the continued store closures in Europe during the quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The increased sales weren't enough to make GameStop profitable again, but they were enough to reduce quarterly losses to $66.8 million (or $29.4 million if you take out one-time payments), down from $108 million a year ago.</p>\n<h2>If they want to buy, we want to sell</h2>\n<p>More than that, the last quarter saw GameStop's bottom line buoyed by the sale of 3.5 million shares of additional stock—$551 million worth—to a rabid market willing to pay an average of nearly $160 per share (compared to the sub-$20 share price at the beginning of the year). Thanks largely to that infusion of cash, GameStop has eliminated $504 million in long-term debts it had on its balance sheet a year ago, and it is now sitting on $770.8 million in cash on hand, up from $583.9 million a year ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772099#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772099&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c6f503b008d8a38029ac2dffaec8d5f414d3ce97af1b5acb6a989394f646b06","category":"Tech"}
