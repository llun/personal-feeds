According to reports Bennett has not been responding to treatments, so the team made the call to send Cavendish to France instead of the 2020 green jersey winner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bennett was originally the top pick to take on the Tour de France in 2021. The Irishman has been one of the top sprinters in the sport for the last couple years, notching two stage wins at the Tour de France in 2020. Bennett‚Äôs 2021 results include a win at the Oxyclean Classic Brugge-De Panne, two stage wins at Paris-Nice, two stages at UAE Tour, and two stages at Volta ao Algarve em Bicicleta. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>No. Words.

His last stage win at the Tour de France was in 2016 when he won stages 1, 3, 6, and 14. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Cavendish taking part in the 2021 Tour de France he has a shot at edging closer to Eddy Merckx‚Äôs all-time record stage wins. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CORVOS_00026834-149-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Mark Cavendish (Dimension Data)  win stage 14 of the 2016 Tour de France from  Montelimar to Villars-les-Dombes Parc des Oiseaux.</figcaption></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/mark-cavendish-is-going-to-the-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c942e0fb88d54dc2a4351a4fbc4e6a2953ba9206a972701c2cfa9bf84b71e364","category":"Cycling"}
