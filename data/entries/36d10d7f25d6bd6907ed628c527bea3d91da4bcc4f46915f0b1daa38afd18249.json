The proposed class action therefore seeks &#36;5,000 in damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws, amounting to at least &#36;5 billion.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle attempted to have the case thrown out by arguing that the plaintiffs consented to its privacy policy, which the company said explicitly discloses its data protection practices. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"Google also makes clear that 'Incognito' does not mean 'invisible,' and that the user's activity during that session may be visible to websites they visit, and any third-party analytics or ads services the visited websites use,\" Google said in a court filing.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the company \"did not notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private browsing mode.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle has said it will defend itself \"vigorously\" against the claims.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/14/judge-rules-google-lawsuit-incognito-mode/\">Judge Rules Google Must Face Lawsuit Alleging Chrome Tracks Users in Incognito Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/judge-rules-google-must-face-lawsuit-alleging-chrome-tracks-users-in-incognito-mode.2288274/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OzWDc9Ga_Ws:JUIQMHkstiw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OzWDc9Ga_Ws:JUIQMHkstiw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OzWDc9Ga_Ws\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"36d10d7f25d6bd6907ed628c527bea3d91da4bcc4f46915f0b1daa38afd18249","category":"Apple"}
