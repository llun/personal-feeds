The feature appeared for some users back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/google-tests-dark-mode-desktop-web-search/\">December</a>, but then quietly disappeared into the internet ether.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/google-dark-mode-verge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"920\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782951\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple introduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a> way back in 2018 with macOS Mojave and iOS 13, and support for the system-wide option is now a staple feature of most native and third-party apps on both mobile and desktop. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBut as we learned from Google's protracted stop-start efforts to bring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/06/gmail-app-ios-dark-mode-rollout-complete/\">dark mode to Gmail</a>, there's no saying when or even if this change will ultimately <del datetime=\"2021-02-11T09:03:42+00:00\">see the light of day</del>.
