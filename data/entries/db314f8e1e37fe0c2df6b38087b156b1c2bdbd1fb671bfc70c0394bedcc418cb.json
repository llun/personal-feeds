Gurman says these new iPads are only an \"iterative update\" to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> line, an increasingly vital product family for the tech giant thanks to the global health crisis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe event will be Apple's first product launch of 2021, and speculation about what could be announced is nothing short of rampant. One of the biggest new upcoming products expected from Apple is redesigned iMacs, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/\">Bloomberg has previously reported</a> will receive a design that it's in line with the Pro Display XDR and a more powerful Apple silicon chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNo timeframe has been set for when these new iMacs could debut and Gurman says, \"if the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> does indeed get launched next, that's going to be a big deal.\" Apple is also reportedly preparing to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, a circular Tile-like tracking device that can be attached and used to locate items such as keys, bags, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe event will take place on Tuesday, April 20, and will be live-streamed via Apple's website, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app, and Apple's YouTube channel. It'll kick off at 10:00 a.m Pacific Time, and for those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage both on MacRumors.com and through the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/april-2021-event/\">April 2021 event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/gurman-apple-event-nothing-innovative/\">Gurman: Apple's 'Spring Loaded' Event Won't Feature Anything 'Particularly Innovative'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apples-spring-loaded-event-wont-feature-anything-particularly-innovative.2291756/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oXvEiXrGl60:iA6a6XG4ZFw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oXvEiXrGl60:iA6a6XG4ZFw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oXvEiXrGl60\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db314f8e1e37fe0c2df6b38087b156b1c2bdbd1fb671bfc70c0394bedcc418cb","category":"Apple"}
