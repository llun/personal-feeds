Among 24-inch ‌iMac‌ buyers, Blue is the most popular color option, with 33.4 percent, Silver the second most popular with 30.1 percent, and then Green with 13.4 percent. The least popular color options are Yellow with 6.8 percent, Pink with 4.1 percent, and Orange with 3.3 percent. This suggests that the majority of ‌iMac‌ customers are not interested in most of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imac-colors/\">new color options</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n61 percent of ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users intend to buy an AirTag. 54 percent feel that the AirTag is a good deal, while 32 percent feel it is reasonably priced. Just 14 percent feel that it is overpriced. Among AirTag buyers, 57 percent are opting for the $99 four-pack option, with the other 43 percent buying them individually for $29, showing a fairly even split.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n42.4 percent of AirTag buyers intend to track their keys, 34.8 percent intend to track pets despite <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/airtags-for-items-not-pets-children/\">Apple disavowing this</a>, 30.6 percent want to track luggage, 25.8 percent intend to track bikes, and 23.3 percent want to track their purse or wallet. Other popular intended uses include tracking <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> cases, children, vehicles, drones, partners, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/3d-printed-airtag-case-apple-tv-remote/\">TV remotes</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n24.9 percent of respondents intend to buy the new ‌iPad Pro‌ with the ‌M1‌ chip. In spite of the Liquid Retina XDR mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model, 66 percent of respondents intend to buy the smaller 11-inch model, which has the same LED display as the previous generation model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLooking to the future, a massive 82 percent of respondents want to see Face ID authentication added to future iMacs and MacBooks. For Apple's upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup, 21 percent want the return of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>. 17 percent desire a 120Hz ProMotion display and 15 percent want a smaller notch or a notch-less design. 12 percent think that the return of a power adapter included in the box is the most important potential feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInterestingly, only five percent of respondents want a smaller, more compact ‌iPhone‌, just one percent want a foldable design, and there also seems to be little appetite to move to USB-C, with only 0.8 percent wanting the removal of the Lightning port.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/\">SellCell</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/13/survey-most-will-buy-airtag-blue-most-popular-imac/\">Survey Finds 60% of iOS Device Owners Will Buy AirTag, Blue Is Most Popular iMac Color, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/survey-finds-60-of-ios-device-owners-will-buy-airtag-blue-is-most-popular-imac-color-and-more.2296004/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mhQ7OXcnKv0:NaqTbQqR53I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mhQ7OXcnKv0:NaqTbQqR53I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mhQ7OXcnKv0\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eeed16905f417a2d48c6e4a730264607d30a8154517fb4aa341ce09a1c33ebb1","category":"Apple"}
