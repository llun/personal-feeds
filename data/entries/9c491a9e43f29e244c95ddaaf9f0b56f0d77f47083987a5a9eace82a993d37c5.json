That's harsh stuff for anyone who chose to spend $30 (or more) on <em>Reforged</em>, so it still needs fixing before we can pretend the company's shaky reputation is anywhere near restored. (Representatives for multiple Activision and Blizzard projects have still yet to respond to my ongoing questions about <em>WC3R</em>. After a no-show at BlizzCon 2021, the developer blamed <a href=\"https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/warcraft3/t/ptr-patch-notes-version-13210-updated-march-16/26817\">\"the nature of the world today\"</a> in March for a lack of updates, even though fans had created <a href=\"https://www.w3champions.com/\">their own grassroots <em>WC3R</em> solutions</a> in that same span of time.)</p>\n<p>Having said that, there's arguably a larger audience in the world that has moved on from <em>WarCraft III</em> yet still has a soft spot for one of Blizzard's most enduring classic games: <em>Diablo II</em>. Twenty-one years later, <em>Diablo II</em>'s gameplay core holds up remarkably well and certainly more so than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/original-diablo-is-now-on-sale-for-10-drm-free-but-not-on-blizzards-app/\">the original, genius-yet-clunky <em>Diablo</em></a>. I love <em>Diablo II</em>, and I love the idea of a refreshed, allegiant <em>Diablo II</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755005#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755005&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c491a9e43f29e244c95ddaaf9f0b56f0d77f47083987a5a9eace82a993d37c5","category":"Tech"}
