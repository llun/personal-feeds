Google explains that for Drive File Stream users, this is just a name change, and all functionality will remain the same. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor Backup and Sync users, they will essentially be using Drive File Stream in all but name, except with the features they're used to incorporated into the one client.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe reason for the change is that some Google Workspace customers have deployed both sync solutions, which can be confusing for end users and challenging for IT departments to manage. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs of version 45, Drive File Stream is known as <a href=\"https://dl.google.com/drive-file-stream/googledrivefilestream.dmg\">Google Drive for desktop</a>, and the company will give three months' notice for Google Workspace admins and end users before the deadline to transition to Drive for desktop. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle Workspace customers with end users who are currently using Backup and Sync can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2f59L2hkw3GHU2q709mtmkpX0NfMG6VThi3kOs40wEcIp3g/viewform?usp=sf_link\">apply for a beta</a> of the new unified Drive for desktop experience, which includes Backup and Sync features.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle says it will announce when Drive for desktop is officially ready for all Backup and Sync users, and will also share more details later this year on how Backup and Sync users can get started with the new client.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-drive/\">Google Drive</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/google-backup-and-sync-drive-file-stream-unified/\">New Google Drive Desktop App to Replace Backup &amp; Sync and Drive File Stream Clients Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-google-drive-desktop-app-to-replace-backup-sync-and-drive-file-stream-clients-later-this-year.2283428/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7IYA1pwNcuA:9D-gv5yrmJw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7IYA1pwNcuA:9D-gv5yrmJw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7IYA1pwNcuA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6cfbde21ca7d117648de35ede9b5208a9179b275670683b2d42e276aa74deb24","category":"Apple"}
