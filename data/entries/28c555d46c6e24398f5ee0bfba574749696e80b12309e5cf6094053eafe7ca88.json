The pair left Xerox in 1982 and founded\nAdobe. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, the programming\nlanguage that helped boost the desktop publishing industry.</p>\n\n<p>Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to\nJuly 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in\nApril 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Warnock from\nSeptember 1997 to January 2017 and was a member of the board until\nApril 2020, when he became emeritus board member.</p>\n\n<p>“I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or\nmore capable business partner,” Warnock said in a statement. “Not\nhaving Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who\nknew him will all agree.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Impossible to overstate how important PostScript was (and remains). What made PostScript so good, so useful, so lasting, is that it’s <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/actionscript/articles/PLRM.pdf\">a full-fledged programming language</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I forgot about this story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In addition to his contributions to the technology industry,\nGeschke was also known for <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/8a22e47c0a3f078f7b1df0dda117d634\">surviving a 1992 kidnapping\nattempt</a>.\nTwo men snatched him as he arrived at work one morning and held\nhim for four days, demanding ransom. He was eventually rescued by\nthe FBI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/18/chuck-geschke\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"28c555d46c6e24398f5ee0bfba574749696e80b12309e5cf6094053eafe7ca88","category":"Tech"}
