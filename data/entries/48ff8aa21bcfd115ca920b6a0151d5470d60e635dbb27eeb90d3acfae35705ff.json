Apple first debuted a mini-LED display this past April in the high-end 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, but the updated 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ did not receive the new display technology. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Pros being just recently updated, we already know some information about what Apple has planned for next year. <em>Bloomberg</em> has reported that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/\">Apple is testing using a glass back rather than an aluminum enclosure</a> for the next release of the ‌iPad Pro‌, which could enable wireless charging for the ‌iPad‌. Additionally, <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman also reports that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/27/apple-exploring-larger-ipads/\">Apple is exploring the possibility of iPads with displays larger than 12.9-inches</a>, but those shouldn't be expected anytime soon. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/kuo-2022-11-inch-ipad-pro-mini-led/\">Kuo: 2022 11-Inch iPad Pro to Feature Mini-LED Display, Not Just 12.9-Inch Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2022-11-inch-ipad-pro-to-feature-mini-led-display-not-just-12-9-inch-model.2303692/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qRQzIJv83DQ:iYOWyBE1ABQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qRQzIJv83DQ:iYOWyBE1ABQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qRQzIJv83DQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"48ff8aa21bcfd115ca920b6a0151d5470d60e635dbb27eeb90d3acfae35705ff","category":"Apple"}
