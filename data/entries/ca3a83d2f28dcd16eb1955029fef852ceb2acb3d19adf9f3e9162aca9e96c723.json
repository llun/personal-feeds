You'd think in the year 2021, the answer would be simple. But between consoles, PCs, and smartphones, even the most comfortable, affordable, and solidly built gamepads come with a compatibility caveat.</p>\n<p>In my 25 years of writing about video games, I have tested a <em>lot</em> of controllers, and my current comfort-and-performance favorite is the Xbox Wireless Gamepad (<a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=Ars8BitDoReview&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-wireless-controller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MSRP: $65</a>, which can vary based on year and color). But it only officially works on Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android.Â You can buy third-party adapters to sync it with platforms like PlayStation or Switch, but that's not necessarily ideal. There's also a whole console-specific controller market, ranging from entry-level pads to high-priced \"pro\" variants, but I generally don't review anything in the weeds of nichey compatibility.</p>\n<p>    </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754394#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754394&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca3a83d2f28dcd16eb1955029fef852ceb2acb3d19adf9f3e9162aca9e96c723","category":"Tech"}
