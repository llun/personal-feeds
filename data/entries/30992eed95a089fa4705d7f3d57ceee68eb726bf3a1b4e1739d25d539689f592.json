Sony has announced that new PlayStation Store game purchases on those consoles will be discontinued on the following dates:</p>\n<ul><li>PlayStation 3: July 2, 2021</li>\n<li>PlayStation Portable: July 2, 2021</li>\n<li>PlayStation Vita: August 27, 2021</li>\n</ul><p>After these dates, users of these older systems will still be able to re-download and play previous purchases, including videos and media. Continuing PlayStation Plus subscribers will also be able to download previously claimed games from that service.</p>\n<p>But users won't be able to make new game purchases, including purchases of in-game content or DLC on these systems after those dates. Existing funds in a PSN wallet on these consoles will still be redeemable on a PS4 or PS5, or they can be refunded at the user's request.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752926#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752926&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30992eed95a089fa4705d7f3d57ceee68eb726bf3a1b4e1739d25d539689f592","category":"Tech"}
