Disney is also set to bring more Marvel movies to subscribers in Europe within a year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFebruary 23 is the date that the app will be added to Disney+ for existing subscribers in the above regions. The European countries set to get the Star content include the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Star brand and additional content arrive at a cost, though, as Disney+ is getting a price bump in these regions. In the U.K., the monthly subscription rate is set to increase from £5.99 to £7.99, or £59.99 to £79.90 per year, with an equivalent increase in the EU in euros. Current subscribers however will enjoy a pay freeze until August 23.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe increased cost is in line with a &#36;1 price hike for subscribers in the United States that will come into effect on March 26.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/disney-star-international-rollout/\">Disney+ Plans International Rollout of Adult-Friendly &#039;Star&#039; Channel to Subscribers Starting Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-plans-international-rollout-of-adult-friendly-star-channel-to-subscribers-starting-next-week.2285081/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xwokoC-l-6o:24wmdCFDsgs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xwokoC-l-6o:24wmdCFDsgs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/xwokoC-l-6o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e03e7db984d2d88bcd8b3f551c84b350fc6d2e15ff07ec537ec232408b2cd9f1","category":"Apple"}
