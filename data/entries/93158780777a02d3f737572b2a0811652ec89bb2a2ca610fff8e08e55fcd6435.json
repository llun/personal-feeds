It is the world's biggest genetic killer of children, though almost exclusively affects boys, and a disease for which there is currently no cure.</p>\n<p>This year's Dash, which is being called The Duchenne Dash: Around the World, will see 300 cyclists attempt to collectively ride the circumference of the world – 40,000km – in 12 hours.</p>\n<p>Since it was launched by Channel 4 News's Krishnan Guru-Murthy as a London to Paris ride eight years ago, the yearly challenge has raised an enormous £5 million and while <a href=\"/tags/coronavirus\">Covid-19</a> meant the 2020 edition had to be cancelled, the Around the World special will be Covid-secure.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9272/cyclists-31-inspirational-women-no1-fiona-kolbinger\">Cyclist&#039;s 31 Inspirational Women No1: Fiona Kolbinger</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9301/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no11-jeannie-longo\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No11: Jeannie Longo</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9311/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no21-marianne-vos\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No21: Marianne Vos</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9321/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no31-marie-odile-amaury\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No31: Marie-Odile Amaury</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nDuchenne UK CEO and co-founder Emily Crossley said, 'Undeterred by the impact of the pandemic, we want to make this year bigger and better than before and raise even more towards life-changing research. </p>\n<p>'Our heart and soul, and our reason for carrying on, are our boys and men, and rare girls, living with DMD.
