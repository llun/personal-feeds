The \"unusually swift\" decision is said to have come just two days after the regulator said it was conducting a cybersecurity review of Didi Global Inc.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ban was effective immediately, but users who downloaded the app before Sunday are still able to order rides and other services. Didi said it had already halted new user registrations as of July 3 and was now working to rectify its app in accordance with regulatory requirements.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/05/12/apple-invests-1billion-didi-chuxing/\">invested</a> $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing company. The move was described by CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ at the time as a \"strategic investment\" that would help Apple better understand the Chinese market. Following its investment, Apple was given a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/11/apple-didi-chuxing-board-seat/\">Didi Chuxing board seat</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's unclear what impact the ban could have on Apple's stake in Didi, but the decision follows broader moves by Beijing to curb the influence of China's largest internet corporations and tighten the ownership of the personal data of hundreds of millions of users held by the likes of Alibaba, Tencent, and others.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/didi-chuxing/\">Didi Chuxing</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/05/china-tells-apple-remove-didi-chuxing-app/\">China Tells Apple to Remove Ride-Hailing App Didi Chuxing From App Store for Data Violations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/china-tells-apple-to-remove-ride-hailing-app-didi-chuxing-from-app-store-for-data-violations.2303284/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6dEuYWbWCnQ:S5e0Y4weq5k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6dEuYWbWCnQ:S5e0Y4weq5k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6dEuYWbWCnQ\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db9679f5372fed81ba44a2d25c6ee04d7f6ead5dd91dec8b9de592fb84fb0a90","category":"Apple"}
