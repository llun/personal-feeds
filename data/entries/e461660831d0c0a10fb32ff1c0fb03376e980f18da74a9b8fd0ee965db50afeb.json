They will likely be attached to items via adhesive or an attachment point like a ring, and there may be multiple ways to use them with different items. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to his retail sources, Weinbach says &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; are estimated to be priced at around &#36;39 each (Samsung's SmartTags are &#36;29.99). When they'll be launched though remains the question.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/ios-14-5-beta-3-items-tab-find-my-app/\">\"Items\" tab enabled by default in the Find My app</a> in the iOS 14.5 beta has led to some hope that Apple's long-awaited &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; item trackers will finally be released soon. Apple said iOS 14.5 will be released in \"early spring,\" but a specific release date remains unclear. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWeinbach also believes Apple will announce new products \"soon,\" either via press release or some sort of event, although event rumors remain murky at best. According to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZK3PEPywX0\">YouTube video</a> by hit-or-miss leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a>, Apple plans to host an April event this year. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nProsser himself acknowledges that it's worth treating this April event rumor with some skepticism since it would be Apple's first April event in 11 years, but he does say the source he got this from has a perfect track record.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEither way, Weinbach's retail source tells him that they are expecting three new products to drop into the tablet, wearable, and accessories categories. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe wearables are \"likely\" to be new seasonable Apple Watch bands, new colors for the solo loop bands, and possibly a new band style. The rumored new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> is the new tablet, while &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; will fall into the accessories category.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nVolume shipments of mini-LED display components for a new 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will reportedly begin in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/digitimes-12-9-ipad-pro-mini-led-q2-2021/\">second quarter of 2021</a>, which spans April through June. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has previously claimed that Apple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/\">announce new iPads as early as April</a>, including new 11-inch and 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/max-weinbach/\">Max Weinbach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everythingapplepro/\">EverythingApplePro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/leaker-reveals-airtags-size-and-price/\">Leaker Reveals Size of Apple&#039;s AirTags and Says They&#039;ll Cost Around &#36;39</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-reveals-size-of-apples-airtags-and-says-theyll-cost-around-39.2289678/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UljWJHGDd1M:Vo8lZ0pJY24:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UljWJHGDd1M:Vo8lZ0pJY24:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UljWJHGDd1M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e461660831d0c0a10fb32ff1c0fb03376e980f18da74a9b8fd0ee965db50afeb","category":"Apple"}
