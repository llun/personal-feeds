Multiple complaints on Twitter suggest that ‌Apple Maps‌ is listing certain businesses incorrectly, directing Australians to residential areas rather than the actual business location.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-maps-hospital-error.jpg\" /><em><div>An erroneous hospital listing located near Twitter user Russell Ivanovic</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Maps‌ appears to be pulling in data from where business owners live, rather than where their businesses are located.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>So here’s a fun stuff up:<br />I think ‌Apple Maps‌ pulled in some weird business data in Australia. Now you can see the name and number of many registered businesses except not their place of business. It’s where the owners live 🙃<br /><br />My suburb has about 30 restaurants in ppls houses 🤪</p>— Russell Ivanovic (@rustyshelf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rustyshelf/status/1380141796462796801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a long list of complaints on Twitter about the errors that Australians have experienced, with restaurants, hospitals, pharmacies, and more listed in the wrong place.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>“Marulan pharmacy” - the one 125km from me is the correct one. <a href=\"https://t.co/9ay9A4WNOB\">pic.twitter.com/9ay9A4WNOB</a></p>— David Colville (@dcolvl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcolvl/status/1380151817351356418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nTwitter users John Cleary and Russell Ivanovic suggest that Apple <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaysee_au/status/1380152094309646341\">has imported</a> an Australian business database that lists the places that businesses are registered to, which is typically the business owner's home address.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Yeah it's quite frustrating it slapped a non-profit I'm part of at my home address. Seems they somehow pulled the ABN database or something.
