Jerseys are being offered only for pre-order at the moment, with shipments slated to begin August 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the question of how buying yet another jersey to help fight climate change makes any sense when what people should arguably doing is buying less stuff in general… well, it seems Velocio has already thought of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re actively encouraging people to just donate to the causes if they don’t need or want another jersey, and the links to do that are on that page, too,” replied Velocio co-founder Andrew Gardner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you do have a use for another jersey, this one does look quite nice, and it doesn’t seem like Velocio’s Unity project is just a marketing ploy. According to Velocio, last year’s Unity jersey alone raised US$110,000, and Velocio’s total donations through the Unity project through the years has totaled nearly US$500,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://velocio.cc/pages/unity\" target=\"_blank\">www.velocio.cc</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/new-velocio-unity-jersey-to-raise-money-to-help-mitigate-climate-change/\">New Velocio Unity jersey to raise money to help mitigate climate change</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f9f0fd13c2fc07ec42a8521f546bf81b1d5829748f45c6250fb98b0120186dfc","category":"Cycling"}
