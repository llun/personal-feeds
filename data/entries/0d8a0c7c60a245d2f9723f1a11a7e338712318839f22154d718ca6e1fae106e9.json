{"title":"Spotify HiFi Icon Spotted in Mobile App Suggests Imminent Launch","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/spotify-lossless-hifi-option-spotted-app/","date":1621340558000,"content":"Spotify in February <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/spotify-hifi-lossless-streaming-option/\">announced</a> plans to introduce a new \"HiFi\" premium tier sometime in 2021, and while the company declined to offer a date, there's reason to believe a launch could be imminent, especially in the wake of Apple Music's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/apple-music-spatial-audio-announced/\">lossless tier announcement on Monday</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/spotify-hifi-icon.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a timely discovery, hints of Spotify's lossless HiFi audio streaming service have again been spotted this week by Reddit user themonarc, who <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/truespotify/comments/netuuw/i_successfully_opened_the_hifi_menu_by_quickly/\">shared their finding</a> with the accompanying image above.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the Reddit poster, a hidden HiFi menu was accessed in the Spotify app by \"quickly tapping the glitched icon\" that briefly appeared on the Now Playing screen upon launch. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDoing so brought up a separate screen explaining that the HiFi option supports 16-bit 44.1kHz streaming over wired earphones. The selected track didn't play in Hi-Fi quality, however, indicating that the server-side functionality isn't yet finalized.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirst reports that Spotify was working on a lossless audio version of its streaming service actually appeared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/02/spotify-lossless-audio-quality-plan/\">over three years ago</a>, when the company started testing the option with a small group of users. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack then, promotional screens pitched the \"Spotify Hi-Fi\" tier as a $5-$10 upgrade to a standard Spotify subscription. However, Spotify will likely be hard pressed to justify a paid-for upgrade, now that Apple Music has announced that its lossless offering, set to drop in June, will be free to existing subscribers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNotably, Amazon Music has already acted to stem a potential audiophile exodus by offering its own Hi-Fi plan as an option for existing subscribers at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/amazon-music-lossless-for-free/\">no extra cost</a>.
