But Sega's latest takedown request, for an innocuous page on a Steam data-tracking site, might take the cake.</p>\n<p>As SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1376525699884978179\">shared on Twitter Monday</a>, Sega's lawyers asked that the site and its host take down a page for <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>. The takedown request alleges that SteamDB is distributing or linking to pirated copies of the game, even though <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210220072338/https://steamdb.info/app/1235140/\">a quick glance at an archived version</a> shows that's not true.</p>\n<p>That page, like every other on SteamDB, simply compiles historical data on pricing, concurrent players, and other statistics from Steam's own API and public store pages. While there is a link to install the game near the top, that link directs users to Steam itself, which will attempt to install a legitimate copy if the user owns it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753133#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753133&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9069f9ca27dd1dac740eb419d85d9fa3d297f7276f543700aaaec639df23c41d","category":"Tech"}
