Now, with its latest v22.3 update announced today, Adobe is officially adding &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; support. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile Photoshop will run natively on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs, there are some caveats. Users will have the ability to run Photoshop as a native &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; app or under Rosetta emulation. Under native mode, however, certain features will not be available. Adobe <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/creative-cloud-updates.html\">says</a> that the ability to import, export, and playback embedded video players is not supported under &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj;, and other features such as preset syncing, shake reduction filter, and the \"Share an image\" button don't currently work.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAdobe is also listing a few known issues that beta users reported for native &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; support. Adobe says that the ability to copy/paste edits between an Adobe app running natively on &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; and one running on Rosetta emulation is currently not supported. As a solution, Adobe is recommending users run both applications under the same mode, either native &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; or Rosetta emulation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlongside &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; support, the March 2021 update includes general and expected bug fixes and improvements. Adobe Creative Cloud customers can update Photoshop using the Creative Cloud Mac app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, Don!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photoshop/\">Photoshop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/adobe/\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/photoshop-apple-silicon-support/\">Adobe Photoshop 22.3 Update Rolling Out With Apple Silicon Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/adobe-photoshop-22-3-update-rolling-out-with-apple-silicon-support.2287795/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3n6-O_WGbyc:OhPEwW2mLNI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3n6-O_WGbyc:OhPEwW2mLNI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3n6-O_WGbyc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"644c9b1e37080cfe107541b0e3a1f992cc59def149f357f1ab650edc864866b7","category":"Apple"}
