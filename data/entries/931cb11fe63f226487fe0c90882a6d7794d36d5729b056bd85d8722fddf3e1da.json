A few hours later, Alexander Richardson (Alpecin-Fenix) was retroactively disqualified from the Tour of Turkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier that day – and prior to Leemreize’s disqualification – Richardson could be seen on the live broadcast riding with his forearms atop the handlebars. His fingers were touching his brake levers, but the position is nonetheless banned under UCI rules, which prohibit “using the forearms as a point of support on the handlebar.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Richardson finished with the pack on the day, he was later kicked out of the Tour of Turkey by the race jury.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alexander Richardson was disqualified after yesterday’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TUR2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TUR2021</a> stage for using this position. </p>\n<p>Assume someone in the higher part of UCI’s hierarchy intervened as it happened after official results where published. <a href=\"https://t.co/ucpYroZSKC\">pic.twitter.com/ucpYroZSKC</a></p>\n<p>— La Flamme Rouge (@laflammerouge16) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laflammerouge16/status/1382622666599841794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/two-riders-disqualified-from-races-for-riding-in-banned-positions/\">Two riders disqualified from races for riding in banned positions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"931cb11fe63f226487fe0c90882a6d7794d36d5729b056bd85d8722fddf3e1da","category":"Cycling"}
