Finishing in biblical weather conditions, Victor Campenaerts finally won his first Grand Tour stage — the third victory for <span>Qhubeka Assos since the first rest day.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>It was a bad day for Bora-Hansgrohe. Emanuel Buchmann crashed moments into the stage and the German was forced to abandon. Buchmann was 6th in the GC and looked to be riding into strong form.

All the riders looking to join the breakaway will need to attack here and the Ineos Grenadiers must carefully monitor who joins the group to avoid any key favourites venturing too far up the road.</span></p>\n<p><span>The descent will take the riders to kilometre 50. Across the following 70kms, the road drags uphill on strenuous false flat terrain. The bonus seconds sprint in Sottoguda occurs at kilometre 120 and immediately leads into the three major climbs. The first is the Passo Fedaia. At 14km and 7.5%, the first category effort could provide an early platform to attack. <span>The ascent can be split into two sections: the first 8.5km and the final 5.5km. The first features shallower and even completely flat terrain, but the final 5.5 kilometres average over 11% and don't resist until the peak.</span></span></p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/T16_S01_Fedaia_600x600.jpg?v=1621785299\" /></div>\n<div><i><span>Passo Fedaia profile</span></i></div>\n<br />\n<div><i><span></span></i></div>\n<div><i><span></span></i></div>\n<p>The descent of the Passo Fedaia leads straight into the Passo Pordoi which is the 2021 Cima Coppi — the highest point over the entire Giro d’Italia. This is the fourteenth occasion that the Passo Pordoi has been the Cima Coppi and the first time since 2002. The 11.8km climb at 6.6% gradient will carry the riders to over 2,200 metres above sea level.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/T16_S02_Pordoi_600x600.jpg?v=1621785332\" /></div>\n<div><i><span>Passo Pordoi profile, the Cima Coppi</span></i></div>\n<br />\n<div></div>\n<div>Following the descent, 50 kilometres still remain. The next 20 kilometres are made up of short hills which are all under two kilometres in length. The final ascent of the day is the Passo Giau. At 9.8 kilometres, it’s the shortest of the four major climbs but by far the steepest. The climb averages 9.3% and although the steepest pitch is at the very foot of the climb, it doesn’t ease much until the top.</div>\n<div>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/T16_S03_Giau_600x600.jpg?v=1621785377\" /></span></p>\n<p><i><span>Passo Giau profile</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Once the Passo Giau is crested there are 17.5 kilometres left which take place almost exclusively downhill to the finish line in Cortina d’Ampezzo — the host resort of the Alpine Ski World Championships in February earlier this year.</span></p>\n<p><span>A plethora of king of the mountain points are available across the day. For the riders eyeing the </span><i><span>maglia azzurra</span></i><span>, joining the breakaway is crucial.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1319491098_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621791827\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Egan Bernal climbing Monte Zoncolan in the maglia rosa (<span>Image credit: Marco Alpozzi/Getty Images)</span></em></p>\n<p><b>Egan Bernal</b><span> has been unstoppable over all 15 stages, but his job is far from complete. None of his GC rivals have been able to prevent him from increasing his lead in the </span><i><span>maglia rosa</span></i><span> since he claimed the jersey on stage nine. Now, his lead at the front is 1:33 over Simon Yates. Although they are long without the help of Pavel Sivakov, the Ineos Grenadiers have the power to control the race and put Bernal in the position to take more time on his rivals. A former mountain-biker, the Colombian has superb descending skills which will be pivotal here. From what we’ve seen so far, Bernal will have no trouble entering the second rest day in pink. The question is: by how much? </span><b>Dani Martínez</b><span> is still in the top-10 and was one of the best finishers from the peloton on Monte Zoncolan. He could play another key role for Ineos.</span></p>\n<p><b>Simon Yates</b><span> finally burst into life on Monte Zoncolan. The Brit has been quiet over the first two weeks and finds himself second-place overall. Yates looks to be riding into peak form for the final week, and with a rest day to follow, perhaps BikeExchange will light up the race and send Yates on the attack early. They have a strong mountain team too, where </span><b>Mikel Nieve</b><span>, </span><b>Tanel Kangert</b><span> and particularly </span><b>Nick Schultz</b> are riding well<span>. If BikeExchange send any of these riders up the road early, they can act as satellite riders to drop back and help Yates late in the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span>Astana Premier-Tech were the brave team that took the challenge to the Ineos Grenadiers on the Zoncolan, but the move backfired. </span><b>Alex Vlasov</b><span> dropped from second to fourth and is now almost two minutes behind Bernal. However, Astana are always one of the most aggressive teams and this mindset is unlikely to change. Further, they are one of, if not the best descending team in the world. This was on show prior to the Monte Zoncolan when they split the peloton in a technical descent. With multiple long descents to choose from this could be their best card.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hugh Carthy</b><span> and </span><b>Damiano Caruso</b><span> are the other two GC contenders in the top five. Carthy is a poor descender and 4,500 metres downhill could worry the Brit, particularly if Astana or another team press on. The loss of </span><b>Ruben Guerreiro</b><span> on stage 15 could be costly too, he has been Carthy’s primary lieutenant in the mountains. A day limiting his losses would leave Carthy satisfied over the final rest day. </span><span>Since Caruso took on the reins at Bahrain-Victorious he has always been among the best in the mountains. However, Bahrain-Victorious only have five riders left in the race and could feel their numerical disadvantage here.</span></p>\n<p><span>Trek-Segafredo could be on the offensive again on terrain which suits the team. </span><b>Bauke Mollema</b><span> has been hunting stages from the breakaway, but their GC leader </span><b>Giulio Ciccone</b><span> could take the spotlight. He is </span><span>now the out-and-out team leader and has been one of the very best on the pure climbing stages. Ciccone is now three minutes down in the overall classification and needs to make up time before the time trial in Milan. If any of the GC contenders are courageous enough to attempt an early attack, Ciccone could be the man.</span></p>\n<p><span>As per usual, <strong>Remco Evenepoel</strong> will be closely monitored by his rivals even though he is almost four minutes behind Bernal. Evenepoel is entering his first third week at a Grand Tour and his challenge for pink is fading. This comes as no surprise considering his preparation. </span></p>\n<p><span><span>With this in mind, it is only a matter of time before Deceuninck Quick-Step switch to stage hunting mode. </span>After the Monte Zoncolan, Evenepoel said, \"<span>I'm still in the top 10, but if my teammates like João want to go in a break that's fine.</span>\" If <strong>João Almeida</strong> or even <strong>James Knox</strong> join the breakaway they have a strong chance.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Pello Bilbao, Davide Formolo, Matteo Fabbro, Felix Großschartner, Koen Bouwman, Michael Storer, Gianluca Brambilla, Antonio Pedrero</strong> and<strong> Geoffrey Bouchard</strong> are other riders that could have their eyes on victory in Cortina d'Ampezzo from the breakaway.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prediction</strong></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1318486708_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621792612\" /></p>\n<p><em>João Almeida (middle) could be a strong contender Image credit: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</em></p>\n<p>João Almeida started the Giro d'Italia poorly, losing his personal GC hopes on Stage 4 to Sestola. Since, Almeida has been tied to Remco Evenepoel and has been called back to assist his Belgian team leader on multiple occasions. With Evenepoel tumbling down the standings, Deceuninck need a stage win to save their Giro.</p>\n<p>Entering stage 16, Almeida is eight minutes down in the GC and 13th overall. Ineos may be hesitant to allow a rider of Almeida's quality up the road even though he doesn't pose an immediate threat to Bernal. Nonetheless, Deceuninck must be aggressive now and <span>João Almeida is our pick to win stage 16 in Cortina d'Ampezzo.</span></p>\n<p><em>Cover image: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</em></p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"10471c7501a4e55b415192cae0cef219d81854de61ccc33ffadd7a36890ce193","category":"Cycling"}
