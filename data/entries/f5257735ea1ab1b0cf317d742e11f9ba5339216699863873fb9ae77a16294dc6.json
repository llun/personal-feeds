This adventurous Kiwi is now based in southern England, and MBUK heads over to his neck of the woods to spend a day in the life of one of the scene’s brightest stars.</p>\n<h2>Speed demons</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Four top-end downhill rigs are pitted head-to-head in this month’s biketest. <em>Steve Behr</em></span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The ultimate ‘one-trick-pony’, the downhill bike is built to descend – and descend fast. They might lack the versatility of modern trail bikes, but they’ve got it where it counts. In this month’s biketest MBUK is putting four of the very best DH machines money can buy through their paces, to see which World Cup-worthy warrior would end up on the podium.</p>\n<h2>Flat-pedal shoes on test</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 12 pairs of flat-pedal shoes are given the grouptest treatment. <em>Mick Kirkman</em></span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>To complement the ‘foot out, flat-out’ style of downhill racers, the grouptest this issue focuses on flat-pedal shoes. The team have taken 12 the greatest and grippiest flats on the market and tested them head-to-head, to find your sole mate – the pair that will serve you best both on and off the bike.</p>\n<h2>Reviving the Rockhopper</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Art editor Jimmer takes a trip on the nostalgia train to rebuild a classic. <em>Georgina Hinton</em></span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>MBUK’s art editor Jimmer takes a trip down memory lane and, with all the will in the world but little of the knowhow to back it up, attempts the holy grail of retro bike builds – a 1993 Specialized Rockhopper. The story of his project should stand testament to the old adage that if you’ve got the motivation, the rest will follow.</p>\n<h2>Blues cruise</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pinner and the beginner head north to find Scotland’s best blue. <em>Ian Linton</em></span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>In the third and final part of our series to find and ride the UK’s best blue-graded trails, MBUK is heading north of the wall to the MTB mecca of Scotland. With such a wealth of brilliant blues over its awe-inspiring mountains and glens, will their pick scotch the competition?</p>\n<h2>And that’s not all…</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pembree’s new R1V flat pedals, tested in Wrecked and Rated this issue. <em>Ian Linton</em></span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>This issue of <em>MBUK</em> is jam-packed with all the latest and greatest bikes, product reviews and news stories from the mountain biking world.
