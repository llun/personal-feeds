Google's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-spring-2021\">latest blog post</a> says that dark mode in Google Maps is \"soon expanding to all Android users globally,\" making the feature official after lots of public experiments.</p>\n<p>Google's uneven rollout strategy makes it hard to nail down when any feature officially \"launches.\" Some users have had dark mode for a while, though, through various experiments and early rollouts. Google has <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/09/dark-mode-signs-show-up-in-google-maps/\">been teasing</a> a dark mode for Google Maps since October 2019, and experimental rollouts hit some users in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/j20h5l/google_maps_dark_mode_ui/\">September 2020.</a> Google Maps has also been showing a dark-colored map in navigation mode for some time, but that's not the same thing as a comprehensive dark mode for all the UI elements.</p>\n<p>If Google Maps is following Android's best practices, the UI <em>should</em> automatically switch over to the dark theme if your system settings have dark mode enabled. Google says you'll also be able to find a new \"theme\" section in the Google Maps settings, where you can toggle the feature manually. The Google Maps dark mode that has been floating around for a while has been on a server-side switch. The code is already on your device, so there's no version we can point to that will enable dark mode; you just have to wait for Google to flag your account.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744797#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744797&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e87f5aefc795c78f1012d775b4b9aeca9298afd29c48c06272a9f1ec12f8a759","category":"Tech"}
