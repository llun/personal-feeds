Replays showed that the cause was an oblivious fan whose eyes were not on the race, instead focussed on the camera moto who led the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo-Visma’s Tony Martin was leading his team near the front when he saw the human obstacle, but he had nowhere to go.

The lucky few still upright opted to neutralise things, stripping off the pace to allow those caught out to rejoin the race.
