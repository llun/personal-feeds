But I also need relaxation and good food. Then I dare to order a pizza from Pizza Hut.'</p>\n<p>If we had to hazard a guess, we'd have Remco down as a stuffed crust pepperoni kind of guy. Although with the 21-year-old set to make his <a href=\"/tags/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a> debut in May, our fingers are crossed he will have the opportunity to sample some better pizza then.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43905\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/03/quick-step-latexco.jpg?itok=tBXskx5y\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Awkwardly posing with products from sponsors also feels like a right of stardom passage for QuickStep riders too. I mean who can forget the yearly Latexco pillow fights? Or Tom Boonen in a bathtub of baked beans? It's standard practice for Patrick Lefevere's men.</p>\n<p>Oh, and just to make you feel old, by the time Remco's five-year Pizza Hut deal expires, he will have only just turned 26 years old. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"343185027a75a91bbd9b35005a7a9850976ad9c85099ea95bcebc4f10fe0cf68","category":"Cycling"}
