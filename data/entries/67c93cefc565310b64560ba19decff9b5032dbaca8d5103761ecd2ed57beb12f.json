Following wind-tunnel testing, Canyon says this model is 2.7 watts faster than the previous Speedmax TT – even with disc brakes.</p>\n<p>As well as being dialled up for aerodynamics, the bars also have improved comfort, with new armpads bringing improved grip and extra dampening. They've also been finished with new Zipp Vuka Shift extensions with smart bar-end shifters that mean you don't need an extra blip box.</p>\n<p>Zipp also provides the wheels with the 808 Firecrest on the front and Super-9 at the back with 23mm and 25mm Continental GP TT tyres respectively.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9567/canyon-speedmax-cfr-tt-images#11\"><p><span>Image 12 of</span>

meter.</p>\n<p>One of the bigger watt-savers though is the CeramicSpeed OSPW system that Canyon says reduces pulley wheel friction by 40-60% from a standard derailleur and saves between 1.6 and 2.4 watts – though the brand doesn't reveal in what capacity those savings are made.</p>\n<p>While Movistar and Alpecin-Fenix may not be riding to win the Giro's TTs, which bookend the race and are expected to be won by Filippo Ganna, Canyon will be hoping that it goes some way in boosting Marc Soler's chances of overall contention.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>
