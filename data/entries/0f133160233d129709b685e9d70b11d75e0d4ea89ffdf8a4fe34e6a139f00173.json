Something fun-looking or faster comes along, and what do they do? Slap a ban right across its tender backside. </span></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-Ymj3Vm\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take that, you saucy innovators. Get back in your corner, you snivelling upstarts. Who’s the daddy now? Well, we are, and don’t you forget it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only this time, instead of a wondrous technical advance falling foul of the powers that be, it’s a riding position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ‘super tuck’ – which immediately takes me back to school days and spending all the dinner money on Mars bars and Golden Wonder – is the latest item to pique the interest of the rule-makers and their mysterious committees in Aigle.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-womens-2021-early-season-a-guide\">Related – The Women's Early Season 2021</a><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\"><br>Related – The Men's Early Season 2021</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be fair, it is in amongst a raft of other rider safety announcements issued by cycling’s governing body this week, but we’re not averse to a bit of clickbaity content, so we’ll not be discussing bidon discarding etiquette, or barrier placement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, it’s the placement of a rider’s nether regions on their top-tube whilst hurtling downhill that has caught our eye-watering attention. Is it really that dangerous?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not according to any number of replies on internet threads worldwide, where many are quick to point out they have never seen a crash in pro cycling caused by a rider assuming the position. They have a point, perhaps, although we suspect a few copycat have-a-go heroes without the prerequisite handling skills of the pros have come unstuck.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/PRESSESPORTS_572981_tdf_063_3515e051-56a3-497a-b3bb-cb39c6ed429e_1024x1024.jpg?v=1612544697\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chris Froome introduced pedalling to the super tuck</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it ungainly? We give you Chris Froome, introducing the pedalling element alongside the tuck during his daring descent of the Peyresourde back at 2016’s Tour de France. But then Froome is never gainly </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Is that an actual word? – Ed]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Yes, and it scores 10 points in Scrabble <span>– Author]</span> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was darned good, however, so let that one go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it more aero? According to a study by academics in Holland and Belgium, apparently not. You’d be better off tucking down on the drops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why ban it? Whilst we wish we’d come up with the perfect riposte, it is our good friend Cillian Kelly – statistics genius, <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/products/the-road-book-2020-ned-boulting\">The Road Book</a> numbers geek, and all-round wise owl – who nailed it with this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/irishpeloton/status/1357647981055528961?s=20\">tweet</a>:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“On the ‘supertuck’ ban, I’ve seen plenty of sarcastic questions asking how many crashes it’s caused so far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think if it did cause a crash we’d all be very quick to blame the UCI for not banning it in the first place. So good on them for being proactive instead of reactive.”</span></p>\n<p>We rest our case, m’lud. Into the sea with the super tuck, and good riddance.
