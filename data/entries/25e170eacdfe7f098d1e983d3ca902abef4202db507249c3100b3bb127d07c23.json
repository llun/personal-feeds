Not because he is named after a delicious Mexican meal but because he represents the underdog that we all cannot help but love.</p>\n<p>The Dutchman took victory on <a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Stage 3 of the Giro d'Italia</a> after a long rainy breakaway effort from Biella to Canale. For large parts of the day, it seemed as if the fate of the riders up the road was settled. The pace from <a href=\"/tags/bora-hansgrohe\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a> behind was infernal, their catch inevitable.</p>\n<p>But the catch never happened. Van der Hoorn played the peloton at its own game, riding in solo for the victory.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9390/chris-froome-tops-list-of-cyclings-top-earners-according-to-reports\">Chris Froome tops list of cycling's top earners, according to reports</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race plus daily photo galleries</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 114: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIt is the biggest victory of 27-year-old's career so far and the first WorldTour win of the season for Intermarche-Wanty Gobert too.</p>\n<p>Better yet, just five months ago, Van der Hoorn was a cyclist without a contract. A victim of the Covid-19 squeeze, he considered packing in professional cycling after being let go by <a href=\"/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a>.</p>\n<p>Eventually, he was offered a lifeline by third-division Beat Cycling before being giving a chance at newly-promoted WorldTour team Intermarche-Wanty Gobert a few weeks later.</p>\n<p>Five months on, he is winning at the Giro. What a story. Here are Chris Auld's images from the day:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9602/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery#8\"><p><span>Image 9 of</span> 18</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giro2021-stage3-9.jpg?itok=4rX0uoh1\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 9 of </span>18</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9602/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery\">Giro d'Italia 2021 Stage 3 Gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>11 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9602%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%203%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9602%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%203%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9602%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%203%20Gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9602%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9602/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-3-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 18</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giro2021-stage3-1.jpg?itok=YvcY5dfa\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"25e170eacdfe7f098d1e983d3ca902abef4202db507249c3100b3bb127d07c23","category":"Cycling"}
