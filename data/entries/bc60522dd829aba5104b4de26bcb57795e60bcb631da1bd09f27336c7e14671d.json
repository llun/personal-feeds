{"title":"CBS All Access Ad Awareness Campaign Reminds Apple TV Owners About Its Rebrand to Paramount+ Next Month","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/13/cbs-all-access-apple-tv-paramaount-plus/","date":1613211566000,"content":"CBS has begun reminding subscribers to its CBS All Access streaming service on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> that its rebranding to Paramount+ will launch on March 4.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/paramount_plus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1820\" height=\"1213\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783501\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nCBS All Access, which is available as an individual &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Channels subscription, appears to have rolled out its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madizzn/status/1360406710192603136?s=20\">ad awareness campaign</a> on the streaming service in the last day or two. \r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>CBS All Access is becoming Paramount+ on March 4, but as a CBS All Access subscriber, you don't have to do a thing. You'll have full access to Paramount+ via your existing &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Channels subscription. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMeet you on the mount, March 4.</blockquote>The rebrand will be accompanied by new titles from other ViacomCBS-owned channels including Paramount, CBS, MTV, and BET.  \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginal content intended to lure new subscribers and retain existing ones include <em>The Offer</em>, a 10-episode scripted mini-series about the making of Francis Ford Coppola's <em>The Godfather</em>, a new version of MTV's <em>Behind The Music</em>, and a renewal of <em>The Game</em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhat the ad campaign doesn't mention is that come March 4, the service will no longer be awailable to subscribers who use a third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to access it, as third-party developers slowly end support for the eight-year-old device.\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/subscribe-apple-tv-channels/\">How to Subscribe to Apple TV Channels Using the Apple TV App</a></li></ul>\r\n<br/>\r\nEarlier this week, subscribers using third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models started seeing a prompt when they opened the CBS All Access app that their access would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/\">end next month</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new Paramount+ app will not be available on the second and third-generation ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ models, but it will be watchable on the fourth and fifth-generation ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ models. It will also be available on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, which means third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; owners will at least be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> it to their older set-top box.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThird-generation ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ users who are looking to upgrade to a newer model may want to hold off for the time being as Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">rumored to be introducing</a> a new ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ set-top box at some point this year. The fifth-generation ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌, which is the current newest version, was released in 2017.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, Michael!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-channels/\">Apple TV Channels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cbs/\">CBS</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/13/cbs-all-access-apple-tv-paramaount-plus/\">CBS All Access Ad Awareness Campaign Reminds Apple TV Owners About Its Rebrand to Paramount+ Next Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cbs-all-access-ad-awareness-campaign-reminds-apple-tv-owners-about-its-rebrand-to-paramount-next-month.2284510/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vWpLodvNEVg:_p6Rws43iVk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vWpLodvNEVg:_p6Rws43iVk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vWpLodvNEVg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc60522dd829aba5104b4de26bcb57795e60bcb631da1bd09f27336c7e14671d","category":"Apple"}
