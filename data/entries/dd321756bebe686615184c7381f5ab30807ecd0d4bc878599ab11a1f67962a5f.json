{"title":"Gmail for iOS Updated for the First Time in Three Months","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/gmail-ios-updated/","date":1614623377000,"content":"After neglecting the app for several months, Google today finally updated Gmail on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for the first time in exactly three months.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/gmail-updated.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"718\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786187\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nToday's update, version 6.0.210124, says it includes \"Bug fixes and performance improvements,\" but it is a notable update given it's the first one the app has seen in months. Alongside Gmail, Google Meet, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Calander, and Google Tasks have also received app updates today, with Google Tasks adding new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>.  \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs with nearly all Google apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Gmail had remained without a proper app update for months. Initial <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/google-ios-apps-still-no-privacy-labels/\">speculation</a> was that Google was holding back app updates as a way to delay having to disclose to users its privacy practices. Updates for Google's more popular apps have started rolling out over the past few weeks, and Gmail is certainly one of the most high-profile ones to finally see an update.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAnnounced at WWDC 2020 and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/app-store-privacy-labels-ios-14-3/\">rolled out</a> officially in December, Apple's privacy \"nutrition labels\" require developers to provide users detailed information about what data they collect and whether they share that data with third parties. As of early December, developers must provide this privacy information before a new or updated app can be made available on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle updated Gmail with privacy labels <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/\">just over a week ago</a>, but the app itself was not updated until today.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gmail/\">Gmail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/gmail-ios-updated/\">Gmail for iOS Updated for the First Time in Three Months</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gmail-for-ios-updated-for-the-first-time-in-three-months.2286675/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aYAYUVl9WvI:D0CImShsq7g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aYAYUVl9WvI:D0CImShsq7g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/aYAYUVl9WvI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dd321756bebe686615184c7381f5ab30807ecd0d4bc878599ab11a1f67962a5f","category":"Apple"}
