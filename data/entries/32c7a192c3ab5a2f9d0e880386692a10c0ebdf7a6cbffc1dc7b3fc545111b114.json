The bonus to using them is that you avoid over-tightening anything, which can affect your warranty on – or simply break –  parts you regularly tighten, such as the frame, fork or handlebar.</p>\n<p>Just remember to undo the torque adjuster before throwing it back in the box.</p>\n<h3>Pedal spanner</h3>\n<p>A proper pedal spanner will give you a better chance of leveraging off pedals, especially if they haven’t been removed in a long time. A good pedal spanner is usually flatter and thinner than a regular spanner, which you may struggle to get between the pedal and crank arm to undo.</p>\n<p>Always apply anti-seize compound to the pedal thread before installation to avoid wrestling with your pedals in the future. Check out our comprehensive guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-bike-pedals/\">how to remove and change bike pedals</a> for more info.</p>\n<h3>Chain breaker tool</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You definitely want to have a chain breaker in your tool kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A chain breaker tool is an essential bit of kit you should get familiar with using properly.</p>\n<p>Use it to repair stiff links and to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-clean-a-bike-chain/\">take your chain off for serious cleaning</a> and so prolong the life of your chain and parts. You can even use it to take out a link and put a speed-link in to make removal/cleaning even easier.</p>\n<h3>Chain whip and cassette lockring tool</h3>\n<p>A chain whip holds the cassette in place and stops the freehub from spinning when removing the lockring of a cassette. It is also used to remove the cog from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-fixies-and-singlespeed-bikes/\">a fixed-wheel bike</a>.</p>\n<p>A good chain whip will have a decent length handle that will help you gain some mechanical leverage and make light work of removing a lockring.</p>\n<p>Check that the chain whip is compatible with the width of the chain that you run on your bike. For instance, is it suitable for 11-speed chains?</p>\n<p>You will also need a splined cassette lockring tool if you want to remove your cassette for replacement or cleaning. SRAM, Campagnolo and Shimano all use different standards for these.</p>\n<h3>Bottom bracket tool</h3>\n<p>A bottom bracket (BB) tool helps you remove or install a bottom bracket into the bottom bracket shell of a bike.</p>\n<p>There is a wide variety of BB tools available due to the numerous<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\"> bottom bracket standards</a> out there and the different ways of installing and removing a bottom bracket, so making sure you have the right tool for the bottom bracket on your bike is a must.</p>\n<p>Shimano Hollowtech II is arguably the gold standard with many brands opting to use it for external bearing and threaded bottom brackets. Shimano Hollwtech II tools also fit a wide variety of BBs from different brands and often work with adaptors for other standards.</p>\n<h2>Best bike tool kits</h2>\n<h3>PRO Advanced Toolbox</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tools only occupy one side of the box so there’s space for your own additions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£200 / $290 / AU$453 as tested</li>\n<li>Quality feeling tools</li>\n<li>Needs to be topped up to be comprehensive</li>\n</ul><p>The PRO Advanced Toolbox has 25 tools that are well-made, a decent weight and feel like they’ll endure the test of time, as you’d expect of PRO (Shimano’s in-house parts brand).</p>\n<p>Rubberised handles give great grip and enhance usability. The Allen keys have a precise fit and both the cassette tool and chain tool are 12-speed compatible. Quick-link pliers are a handy addition to the set.</p>\n<p>The custom-cut foam inlay keeps the tools firmly in place, while the metal clasps on the carry case are robust and secure.</p>\n<p>Ideally, it’d include a complete Torx set (it has T20, T25 and T30 wrenches) and a 1.5mm Allen key. If we’re being really picky, a flat-blade screwdriver would be nice too, but overall, there’s little to criticise with this excellent kit.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/tool-kits/pro-advanced-toolbox-review/\">Read our review of the PRO Advanced Toolbox</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Birzman Essential Tool Box</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n<dl><dt>\n<p></p><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Birzman Essential Tool Box includes everything from a Torx set to a Hollowtech II BB tool.</span></figcaption><span></span></div></dt>\n</dl></div>\n<ul><li>£150 / $178 as tested</li>\n<li>Professional-looking kit</li>\n<li>Pricey</li>\n</ul><p>The Birzman Essential Tool Kit is a professional-looking kit, with each of the tools stowed in a labelled foam pocket within the hard plastic case.</p>\n<p>Thirteen ‘pieces’ are provided (20+ tools), covering most of what’s required to build a bike.

The cassette tool can be used with SRAM XD cassettes, and the chain whip and chain tool are 12-speed compatible too, with the latter working especially well.</p>\n<p>The dedicated ¼in bit driver makes the kit ripe for expanding in the future, as your mechanic’s skills grow.</p>\n<p>The case feels fairly low-quality and the contents rattle in it when it’s carried. This kit includes an internal BB tool and crank puller, which aren’t that useful for modern bikes.

The tools feel weighty and high-quality.</p>\n<p>The long Allen keys are easy to use, and the inclusion of the 1.5mm size is a bonus. It’s great to see a torque wrench included too, and we found the chain tool particularly good for helping to free sticky links.</p>\n<p>The case is sturdy, with foam cut-outs for each tool and zipped covers. During transit, there was no rattling and the tools remained in place.</p>\n<p>While the cable cutters are sharp, they don’t have the smoothest action. The cassette tool’s chamfered edges mean it doesn’t engage that securely with SRAM XD 11- and 12-speed cassettes.</p>\n<p>A couple of the tools – the internal BB tool and crank puller – are virtually redundant now and could be replaced.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/tool-kits/topeak-prepbox-toolbox-review/\">Read our review of the Topeak Prepbox toolbox</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Related reading</h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-everyday-bike-hacks-every-rider-should-know/\">6 everyday bike hacks every rider should know</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/clean-your-bike-in-7-simple-steps/\">How to clean your bike in 7 simple steps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-inflate-a-bicycle-tyre-everything-you-need-to-know-about-pumps-valves-pressure-and-more/\">How to pump up a bike tyre | everything you need to know about pumps, valves, pressure and more</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-safety-check-your-bike/\">Make sure your bike is safe to ride with the M check</a></li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><hr /><h2>Also consider</h2>\n<p>The following tool kits scored lower than the four out of five stars required to make our best list, but are still worth considering.</p>\n<h3>Halfords Bikehut 30pc Bike Tool Kit</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n<dl><dt>\n<p></p><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tools are held in place by small plastic lugs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans / Immediate Media</i></span></div></dt>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl></div>\n<ul><li>£60 (international pricing N/A) as tested</li>\n<li>Plenty of tools covering most jobs</li>\n<li>Solid performer but could do with some improvements</li>\n</ul><p>The Halfords Bikehut 30pc Bike Tool Kit is a solid performer and should complement the budding mechanic with a host of bike-specific tools that serve well as a segue into more technical tasks.</p>\n<p>The rubberised handles on the larger tools are comfortable to hold.
