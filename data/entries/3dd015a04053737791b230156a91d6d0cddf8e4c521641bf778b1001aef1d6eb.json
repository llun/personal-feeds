Apple is likely to compensate Samsung for the missed OLED panel purchase targets as a result, an industry source told the <em>Herald</em>: \r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"It is uncertain whether Apple would pay a penalty to Samsung Display, but considering its contract history and sluggish sales of the iPhone 12 mini, it is likely that Apple will compensate Samsung,\" an industry official said on condition of anonymity. </blockquote>Samsung is the sole supplier of the 5.4-inch panel used in the iPhone 12 mini, the smallest model of Apple's 5G-supporting iPhone 12 series. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf the prediction turns out to be accurate, it would be the third time that Apple has had to reimburse Samsung for missing OLED display targets after saying it would buy a certain number of the panels from the South Korean company. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple reportedly paid Samsung an estimated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/05/apple-paid-samsung-683-billion-missing-oled-target/\">&#36;683 million</a> in 2019 and approximately <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/13/apple-samsung-oled-panel-payment/\">&#36;950 million </a>in 2020 for similarly below-par OLED panel orders. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSamsung remains the world's leading smartphone display panel vendor, and has provided the overwhelming majority of OLED panels for Apple's iPhones over the last few years. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Omdia, global OLED panel shipments reached 53 million units in January, and Samsung Display accounted for 85 percent of them.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp/\">barrage</a> of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/production-shifting-from-iphone-12-mini-to-pro/\">reports</a> this year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/poor-iphone-12-mini-sales-supply-chain/\">suggesting</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/iphone-12-mini-low-january-sales/\">lackluster</a> iPhone 12 mini sales, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-mini-expected-despite-12-sales/\">expected</a> to retain its smallest 5.4-inch iPhone model size in its forthcoming iPhone 13 lineup.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-likely-compensate-samsung-oled-orders/\">Apple &#039;Likely&#039; to Reimburse Samsung for Missing OLED Display Purchase Targets Due to Poor iPhone 12 Mini Sales</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-reimburse-samsung-for-missing-oled-display-purchase-targets-due-to-poor-iphone-12-mini-sales.2289306/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wqPGzP3-S9k:A3e-8QZ_uWI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wqPGzP3-S9k:A3e-8QZ_uWI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wqPGzP3-S9k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3dd015a04053737791b230156a91d6d0cddf8e4c521641bf778b1001aef1d6eb","category":"Apple"}
