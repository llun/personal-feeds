If you're wary of bulky phones, you might be happier with the 12 Pro.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\nOther top smartphones in the list include the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G (named Best Android Phone), and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, which took the \"Best Budget Phone\" and \"Best Phone for All-Day Battery Life\" awards.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nConsumer Reports <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/products/cell-phones-services-28951/smart-phone-28726/view2/\">maintains a ranking</a> of the best smartphones that are on the market by a number of criteria, and several iPhones top that list, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a>, 11 Pro Max, 12, 12 mini, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple will have new smartphones coming in 2021, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models are already in the works.
