This is very likely to end in a sprint too, but race director Christian Prudhomme did mention “windy conditions on the few unsheltered uplands” when describing this stage, so that could be fun. Plus, the first three stages have featured enough drama that basically anything seems possible right now. A forecast that calls for nasty weather will only bolster the chances of more potential chaos for what must be a nervous peloton at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> Echelons? Also: what’s happening with yellow?<br /><strong>Who’s it for:</strong> The sprinters again.<br /><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>With Caleb Ewan out of the race and the Alpecin-Fenix lead-out train having proven its strength, Tim Merlier looks like a great bet to nab the team’s third straight victory. Arnaud Démare should be in the mix as well, while Mark Cavendish, with the help of the powerhouse Deceuninck-QuickStep lead-out, will also have a real chance to get his first Tour stage win in five years.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-4-of-the-2021-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"CyclingTips","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ca2aa91a78560a8ab8c9d1823222047b6c47def3578dccf081b446d0d47618c2","category":"Cycling"}
