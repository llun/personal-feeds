We will fight to be even better on the next races coming up.'</p>\n<p>However, Roglič also admitted that the extent of his injuries was a little worse than he'd expected, saying, 'I'm still recovering, it will maybe take some days more than I thought it would. But I crashed twice and now I really need to heal up.</p>\n<p>'I will do the Tour of the Basque Country in three weeks, then a few one day races in the Ardennes, then of course the <a href=\"/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> later in the year.'</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9387/tirreno-effort-will-have-positive-impact-on-milan-san-remo-form-says-van-der-poel\">Tirreno effort will have &#039;positive impact&#039; on Milan-San Remo form, says Van der Poel</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/9377/primoz-roglic-lays-out-plans-after-paris-nice-disappointment\">Primoz Roglic lays out plans after Paris-Nice disappointment</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9373/musical-saddles-making-sense-of-pro-team-rider-changes-for-2021\">Musical saddles: making sense of pro team rider changes for 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9378/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-25-the-backstedts-roubaix-dream\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast Episode 25 – The Backstedts&#039; Roubaix dream</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nRoglič does, of course, have his <a href=\"/tags/li-ge-bastogne-li-ge\">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a> title to defend, which he won just weeks after losing the Tour de France also right at the finish. Although it's safe to say Julian Alaphilippe won't be celebrating too early this time.</p>\n<p>The Tour is still clearly Roglic's top priority though. 'I will do everything for that win. I'm working for that and the guys around me know that if we give everything then the best guy will win,' he said. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"10b877b1f4ddd0ad1781ea7de9ae808cfa40e919ddc1fd246a289a3d3c44ddf8","category":"Cycling"}
