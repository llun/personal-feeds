If you need to do anything else, don’t get\nyour hopes up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that they completely broke fast-forwarding and rewinding is mind boggling. Those aren’t exactly obscure power user features. Just use the standard video player. I don’t know how this update shipped. (The worst part is, my wife and I are hooked on <em>Mare of Easttown</em>, and have been binging it all week. Really sucks not being able to do anything except play and pause.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/06/hbo-max-tvos\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ccdc1022ac0cb6a0a7edd812bfb667141d5cdf057a53322416f3f3b5abfd64d1","category":"Tech"}
