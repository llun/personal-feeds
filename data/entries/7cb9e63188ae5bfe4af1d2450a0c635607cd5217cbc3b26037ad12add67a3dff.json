Some &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; headphones were seeing excessive battery drain while in the Smart Case, and now there's evidence that the update does indeed fix the problem.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-max-firmware-update.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787890\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nDeveloper Guilherme Rambo tested &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; battery drain before and after the firmware update to see how much battery life was being lost while the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; were in the Smart Case. Battery drain was measured in half hour intervals, and as the charts show, the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; lost more battery life in the Smart Case prior to the firmware update.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; battery usage in the Smart Case before and after the latest firmware update.

From <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/goto/post?id=29676277\">F23</a>:<blockquote>Updated yesterday. 24 hours later, they did NOT lose a single percent. Still at 97% after 24 hours in the case. On previous software version i would lose 10%+ overnight consistently.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\nOther <em>MacRumors</em> readers have noted improvements to automatic switching when using the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and a fix for a bug that could sometimes cause them to disconnect between devices.

Automatic switching between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> seems to be much better now. It was unusable before and just had in manual on the Mac.</blockquote>According to <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/12/airpods-max-battery-drain-issues-fixed/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, the firmware update appears to put the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; into an ultralow power mode after 30 minutes. Prior to the firmware update, &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; would go into a low power mode when placed in the case, and an ultralow power mode after 18 hours. If this is the case, though, Apple has yet to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886\">update its support document</a> to reflect the charging changes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's no clear cut way to update firmware for the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; like there is for devices like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but connecting the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; to a power source and then listening to music for a few seconds to connect them to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> typically forces the update.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can check the firmware on your &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; by following these steps:\r\n<br/>\r\n<ol>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li>Connect your ‌&zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;‌‌ to your iOS device.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li>Open the Settings app.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li>Tap General.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li>Tap About.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>‌‌‌‌‌.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li>Look at the number next to \"Firmware Version.\"</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br/>\r\nHave you noticed better battery life since upgrading to the 3C39 firmware?
