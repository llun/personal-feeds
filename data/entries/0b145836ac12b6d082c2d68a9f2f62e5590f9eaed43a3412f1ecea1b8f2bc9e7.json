It features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a>, so the only plan you need is a 200GB or 1TB <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Storage plan to record video.

It does require a subscription for video storage, though.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat-with-voice-control/\">Ecobee Smart Thermostat with Voice Control</a></strong> (&#36;250) - This is Ecobee's top of the line Smart Thermostat, which learns and adapts to your schedule to keep your home at a comfortable temperature at all times.
