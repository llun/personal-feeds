The page in question suggested a two-day test run for this new service, available exclusively to subscribers of Sony's paid PlayStation Plus service, on April 21-22.</p>\n<p>While the description of the service was vague, merely mentioning PS Plus Video Pass and a date range, an attached image clarified what PlayStation console owners should expect: three recent films released by Sony Pictures Entertainment (<em>Venom</em>, <em>Bloodshot</em>, <em>and</em> <em>Zombieland: Double Tap</em>). PS Plus Video Pass thus might revolve around films from Sony-owned companies like Columbia Pictures and TriStar Picturesâ€”but whether additional studios might participate, and exactly how films would be doled out to paying customers, remains unclear.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758943#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758943&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a9acff214739f69f925de4fdd64e47aeb2b3c35b9d4f5808b11195f86363bd51","category":"Tech"}
