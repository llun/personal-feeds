Here’s a synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Cracked Earth won’t beat around the bush. Because we no longer can. Climate change is not a future threat; it’s our generation’s reality. The film captures the lives of cyclists in vulnerable areas around the world who share their love for the bike, but also their concern about the current state of their homeland – and its ever more uncertain future. </p>\n<p>Cyclists just like you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can see more at <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/crackedearthfilm/cracked-earth-film\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a>!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"dd6c61de0d9f974ecaf747a4e0f2fb7600c198fd0d1bd0e393c21dec14bea386","category":"Cycling"}
