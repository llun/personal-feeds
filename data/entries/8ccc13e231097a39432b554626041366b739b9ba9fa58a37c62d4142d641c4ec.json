Unless you receive permission from the user to enable tracking, the device's advertising identifier value will be all zeros and you may not track them.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen submitting your app for review, any other form of tracking -- for example, by name or email address -- must be declared in the product page's ‌App Store‌ Privacy Information section and be performed only if permission is granted through AppTrackingTransparency. You'll also need to include a purpose string in the system prompt to explain why you'd like to track the user, per ‌App Store‌ Review Guideline 5.1.2(i). These requirements apply to all apps starting April 26, 2021.</blockquote>The April 26, 2021 deadline suggests that iOS 14.5 will either be released on that date or the day after. Apple today released the iOS 14.5 release candidate in preparation for the launch, so the update is nearly ready to go.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple today also released release candidate versions of iPadOS 14.5, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> 11.3, tvOS 14.5, and watchOS 7.4, all of which we're expecting to see early next week.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/app-tracking-transparency-april-26-enforcement/\">Apps Must Adhere to App Tracking Transparency Rules and Be Built With iOS 14 SDK Starting April 26</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apps-must-adhere-to-app-tracking-transparency-rules-and-be-built-with-ios-14-sdk-starting-april-26.2292431/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6vD3v0LDjdQ:E0T1IHVnl0w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6vD3v0LDjdQ:E0T1IHVnl0w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6vD3v0LDjdQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8ccc13e231097a39432b554626041366b739b9ba9fa58a37c62d4142d641c4ec","category":"Apple"}
