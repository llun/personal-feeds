While that's still more than a day, it's a steep decline from pre-pandemic times; in 2019 the average American sacrificed 99 hours to traffic jams. Around the world, it's a similar story. German drivers averaged an identical 26 hours of traffic in 2020, down from 46 the year before. In the UK, 2019 sounded positively awful, with 115 hours in traffic jams. At least one thing improved for that island nation in 2020: its drivers only spent 37 hours stationary in their cars.</p>\n<p>This data was all collected by traffic analytics company Inrix for its 2020 Global Traffic Scorecard that tracks mobility across more than 1,000 different cities around the world based on travel times, miles traveled, trip characteristics, and the effect of crashes on congestion in each city.</p>\n<p>And unless you've spent the past 12 months in a cave—in which case, gee, do I have some crappy news for you—you'll instinctively know that there were big declines in traffic in 2020, and in particular a drop in people traveling to downtowns and central business districts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748232#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748232&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
