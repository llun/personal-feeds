If the terms are fulfilled, this would come to 62 launches over the next eight years for ABL Space. In an industry where even a single launch contract often produces a news release, a contract for five dozen launches is unprecedented for a private company.</p>\n<p>Officials with ABL Space declined to offer specific financial terms of the agreement. However, ABL said the contract comes with a \"significant\" minimum commitment beginning in 2022, plus additional paid options in each future year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754390#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754390&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5f51735be92701933435125c831de4031b8b596fa031151f797b185a88f3d56c","category":"Tech"}
