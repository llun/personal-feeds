However, alongside a new powerful chip, new evidence is pointing towards a possible new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote also shipping alongside the TV set-top box.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/apple-tv-remote-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-791362\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/29/apple-developing-new-remote-for-the-next-generation-apple-tv/\">report</a> from <em>9to5Mac</em>, citing people familiar with Apple's plans, the company has been developing a new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote under the codename \"B519,\" which differs from the current \"B439\" codename for the existing remote. Specifics on what to expect from the new remote aren't provided; however, <em>9to5Mac</em> believes the changes will be \"significant.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe last time Apple updated the remote was with the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K in 2017, when the company added a white border around the Menu button. However, the remote has remained unchanged since, while its slimline design and lack of physical navigation buttons continues to divide users. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-siri-remote-tvos-14-5-beta/\">recently discovered</a> that within the tvOS 14.5 beta, Apple has renamed the remote from \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote\" to \"&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Remote\" in multiple instances across the system. The system-wide change in wording could indicate that the new remote will have less of a focus on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and instead be designed around more traditional content navigation and other TV functionality.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/new-apple-tv-remote-in-the-works/\">Apple Reportedly Working on Redesigned Apple TV Remote</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-working-on-redesigned-apple-tv-remote.2290044/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PyAtE3BUUJ4:kNdC_kAce7g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PyAtE3BUUJ4:kNdC_kAce7g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PyAtE3BUUJ4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e1738260c6f4e918df35aa566da659b172b1c595aef923b464406de834972c8","category":"Apple"}
