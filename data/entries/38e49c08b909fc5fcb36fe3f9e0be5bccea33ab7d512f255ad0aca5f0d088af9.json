This morning, Salsa announced the new 2021 model with a few key updates including top tube mounts for bags, the downtube received Three-Pack mounts, an upgrade to Alternator 2.0 dropouts, improved cable routing, and integrated chainstay protection.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2289\" height=\"1526\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206235\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?w=2289&amp;quality=75 2289w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/TJackGeo.png?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2289px) 100vw, 2289px\" /></p>\n<p>The biggest change is the switch from a 130mm to a 150mm fork and an updated geometry, which you can see above. You can still run a 29er or 27.5+ wheelset on the Timberjack as well. Build kits range from a Ti Timberjack frame for $2,699, GX Eagle 29er for $2,499, SLX complete for $1,799, and the frameset runs $599.
