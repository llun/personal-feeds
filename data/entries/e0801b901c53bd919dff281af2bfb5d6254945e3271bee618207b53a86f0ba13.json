We could no longer spontaneously leave the house. If I wanted to go outside for a moment, there was an officer by my side so that nothing could happen.'</p>\n<p>The 27-year-old also revealed that things got so bad that one individual even posted a noose with a handwritten message telling him to use it on his future child, the final threat that forced Groenewegen to involve the local police.  </p>\n<p>Threats of violence were sent to the Jumbo-Visma rider after his involvement in the <a href=\"/news/8904/dylan-groenewegen-handed-nine-month-suspension-for-tour-of-poland-crash\">Stage 1 crash of last year's Tour of Poland</a>.

What happened here? How is this possible? What sick world do we live in? The most crazy things go through your head. Getting out of bed in the morning was quite a challenge in that period,' confessed Groenewegen. </p>\n<p>'In the beginning, you really have a shock in your body. We have an alarm on our house and it went off exactly during that period. Then you start thinking about the craziest things. We have also had a false alarm a few times, then you get scared.'</p>\n<p>Both Groenewegen and Jakobsen will, thankfully, return to the professional peloton in 2021, however a specific date for either is yet to really be confirmed.</p>\n<p>Deceuninck-QuickStep are hopeful Jakobsen could be racing again by this August although he is personally aiming for a quicker return.</p>\n<p>Groenewegen will also return to the peloton but not before 7th May after the UCI handed the sprinter a <a href=\"/news/8904/dylan-groenewegen-handed-nine-month-suspension-for-tour-of-poland-crash\">nine-month suspension for the crash in Poland</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"e0801b901c53bd919dff281af2bfb5d6254945e3271bee618207b53a86f0ba13","category":"Cycling"}
