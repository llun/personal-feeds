{"title":"Upcoming Apple TV Could Support 120Hz Refresh Rate According to tvOS 14.5 Beta Code","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/apple-tv-120hz-support-tvos-14-5-code/","date":1617667841000,"content":"Apple is working on a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> that's set to be released at some point in 2021, and the new set-top box that's coming could feature support 4K 120Hz video output.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Apple-TV-120hz-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1852\" height=\"1042\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-792536\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nEvidence of 120Hz support was found in the tvOS 14.5 beta code by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/05/tvos-14-5-beta-code-suggests-120hz-support-coming-to-a-new-apple-tv-model/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, with the code listing multiple instances of \"120Hz and \"supports120Hz.\" The code was found in PineBoard, Apple's name for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; interface.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe references to 120Hz refresh rate support suggest that Apple is testing this feature for the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and it suggests that the new set-top box will use HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.0, used for the current fifth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K, is limited to 4K resolution at 60Hz. HDMI 2.1, however, is able to support streaming 4K content at 120Hz.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs with the 120Hz refresh rate on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, a 120Hz refresh rate mode on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; would allow for smoother performance on 120Hz television sets and would be ideal for gaming where there's a lot of quick action as you might find in shooting games.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are 120Hz TVs on the market, which people generally buy for gaming purposes and use with the latest Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 consoles, both of which support the HDMI 2.1 specification and can output 4K video at 120Hz.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe don't yet know when the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will launch, but rumors have suggested it will feature a faster processor and a redesigned remote. Some rumors also suggest that Apple is planning for an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; that would offer a console-like gaming experience, and 4K 120Hz support would allow the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to better compete with the latest flagship gaming consoles.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/apple-tv-120hz-support-tvos-14-5-code/\">Upcoming Apple TV Could Support 120Hz Refresh Rate According to tvOS 14.5 Beta Code</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-apple-tv-could-support-120hz-refresh-rate-according-to-tvos-14-5-beta-code.2290730/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QeSDzyK3880:CGxedLuJSqo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QeSDzyK3880:CGxedLuJSqo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QeSDzyK3880\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae01c834369b2bd62efec2fd9bd1620811c15877830ee1def8a20ddc09f9909b","category":"Apple"}
