They decided to just build a whole frame, why not?  Elliot pulled some inspiration from Don McClung with that double top tube and devilishy short wheelbase.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-205924\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-34.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2003px) 100vw, 2003px\" /></p>\n<p>Paul levers, check. DT Swiss 240 hubs with HED belguim rims , which Elliot laced as well.  Carbon 29er fork with V brakes, check. Moné MRB bars with a Thompson stem to cap it all off, what else? A buddy stitched the framebag for all those klunking essentials.  Finally,  no bike would be complete without a spoke card from Monique.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-205906\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=1024,681&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=1800,1198&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=1335,888&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=700,466&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Elliots-Klunker-16.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2003px) 100vw, 2003px\" /></p>\n<p>Elliot told me that they had &#8220;zero regrets about the geometry.&#8221; I took it for a quick spin and instantly understood how they held that wheelie for so long.  This bike is dripping in DIY and that geometry is just egging you on to have some fun.  Oh yeah, Elliot is in high school, like freshman in high school. I&#8217;ve said it once and Ill say it again, the kids are alright y&#8217;all.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ec91b3bf38e154c45c59994bf09aa36ecf535329effb6cd1914801e52b882f4c","category":"Cycling"}
