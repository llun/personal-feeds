Not all of the products announced in April have begun shipping yet, though, and there are still plenty of releases in Apple’s services to look forward to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The April <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343881/everything-apple-announced-at-its-april-20-spring-loaded-event.html\">Spring Loaded event</a> brought several new products to buy, but only the AirTag and purple iPhone 12 shipped in April. The others go on sale April 30, and ship in a vague “second half of May” timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>24-inch iMac</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest product of Apple’s Spring Loaded event was a newly-designed 24-inch iMac that comes in a rainbow of colors. It’s got Apple’s M1 chip, a whole new display, and it’s super thin. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343752/apple-imac-m1-processor-colors-specs-design-display-keyboard-touch-id-camera-price.html\">Read all about the 24-inch M1 iMac here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/m1-imac-2021.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>24-inch iMac (2021)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/m1-imac-color-lineup-hello.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299 | $1,499 | $1,699\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac&amp;subid1=1-1-344623-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$1299 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h3>iPad Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros are also powered by the M1 processor, and the USB-C port has been upgraded with Thunderbolt support, too.

The A10X processor has been swapped out for the A12, which is just a little faster and enables 4K HDR video at up to 60fps. The HDMI port now supports HDMI 2.1, which is nice. But the big improvement is the new Siri Remote, which will also be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343858/you-can-upgrade-your-siri-remote-without-buying-a-new-apple-tv.html\">available separately for $59</a> if you just want to buy one for your existing Apple TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-2021.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple TV 4K (2021)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-apple.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t32GB $179 | 64GB $199\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k&amp;subid1=1-1-344623-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$179 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h3>Rumored new products</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a surprisingly jam-packed spring event and WWDC scheduled for early June, it’s extremely unlikely that Apple announced any new products in May. The only possible exception is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/new-airpods-2020-3780443/\">AirPods</a>, which have been rumored to be shipping for months and have arrived randomly via press release in the past. It’s still very unlikely any unannounced products arrive before WWDC in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>iOS 14.6 and iPadOS 14.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has already begun testing <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344220/ios-14-6-features-release-date-beta-how-to-install.html\">iOS and iPadOS 14.6</a>. There were no outwardly visible changes in the first beta, so maybe this release will come pretty quickly and release in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Big Sur 11.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the new iOS 14.6 releases, Apple has begun testing macOS 11.4. The first beta didn’t do anything but add support for newer Radeon graphics products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>tvOS 14.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where iOS goes, so too goes tvOS. The latest release, 14.6, is in testing now. As with iOS, there are no major obvious changes, so perhaps this will only be in beta for a few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>watchOS 7.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The watchOS companion to iOS 14.6, this one didn’t show any visible changes in its first beta release, either. As with the other in-testing operating systems, we’re hopeful that it’ll release sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Podcast Subscriptions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple made several tweaks to the Podcasts app in iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and macOS 11.3. But the most interesting new feature, the ability to subscribe directly to specific podcasts, is launching in May. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343771/apple-introduces-podcasts-subscriptions-new-features-in-podcasts-app.html\">Podcast Subscriptions</a> allow podcasters to set their price (Apple gets 30% the first year, 15% thereafter) and offer exclusive content or early access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Card Family</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in May, you’ll be able to co-own your Apple Card with another family member, sharing its affect on your credit rating. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-apple-card-family-enabling-people-to-share-apple-card-and-build-credit-together/&amp;xcust=1-1-344623-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Card Family</a> will also allow parents to share their Apple Card with their kids (over 13), with spending limits and controls to keep them in check. Existing Apple Card users will also be able to merge their accounts if they’re in the same family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually releases new shows, movies, and episodes to Apple TV+ on Fridays at around midnight Eastern time. You can see our entire list of all the Apple TV+ shows, series, and movies in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3245534/apple-tv-originals-release-dates-rumors-news-actors-directors.html\">list of current Apple TV+ shows</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/340717/apple-tv-plus-shows-moves-series-unaired-production-film-television.html\">upcoming Apple TV+ content</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure><p><strong>Mythic Quest (season 2):</strong> The second season of one of the best shows on Apple TV+ begins on May 7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trying (season 2):</strong> If you like your comedy a little more dry and… British… you’ll be pleased that season 2 of <em>Trying</em> is coming on May 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything:</strong> This eight-part documentary about the musicians that shaped politics and culture in 1971 premieres on May 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Arcade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple releases new games to Apple Arcade on Fridays, but not <em>every</em> Friday is marked by a new game or significant update.
