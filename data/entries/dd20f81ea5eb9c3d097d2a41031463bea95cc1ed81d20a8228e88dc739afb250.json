One in particular showed <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3609096/apple-silicon-m1-macbook-mac-mini-ssd-read-write-excessive-data-terabytes.html\">15TB written in two months</a>. That’s quite a bit, and almost certainly due to swapping main memory to the SSD.</p><p>The reports became a cause for alarm for M1 Mac owners, but is it really a problem? While it's true that SSDs have a limited lifespan, how long that SSD lasts comes down to how you use your Mac.</p><h2>SSD longevity</h2>\n<p>A common misconception about SSDs is that they don’t last very long. That's due partially to the early days of SSDs, when the lifespan of NAND flash storage used on an SSD was severely underestimated, and drives often quit after a relatively small amount of use. As it turned out, it was hardly ever the NAND failing, but the controller locking up. The fine art of controller design has come a long way, and I haven’t heard of a failure in years. Many years. </p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3611328/how-worried-should-you-be-about-your-m1-macs-ssd-lifespan.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Jon L.
