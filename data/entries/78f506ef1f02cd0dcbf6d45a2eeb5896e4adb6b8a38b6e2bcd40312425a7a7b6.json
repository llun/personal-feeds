{"title":"Nacer Bouhanni is still a nightmare","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/nacer-bouhanni-is-still-a-terror/","date":1616980800000,"content":"<p>There aren&#8217;t many professional cyclists with a section titled &#8220;Incidents&#8221; on their Wikipedia page. Nacer Bouhanni has many incidents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was the time he hit Jack Bauer at the 2017 Tour de France. And the time he had to be physically separated from Rudy Barbier after Barbier won Paris-Bourges. Or the time he was accused of a &#8220;violent altercation&#8221; with his own director, Roberto Damiani, at Eschborn-Frankfurt. The list goes on.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are only so many headlines one can write about fistfights and pugilism and a history as a boxer before you start to wonder if such things belong in bike racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, Bouhanni was disqualified from the one-day Cholet-Pays de la Loire, won by Elia Viviani, after swinging hard from the right side of his leadout man to the far left, pinning Groupama-FDJ&#8217;s Jake Stewart against the barriers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stewart hit the barrier, leaned against it, but managed to keep it upright. He went from contesting the sprint to finishing in 29th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Bouhanni&#8217;s long list of &#8220;incidents,&#8221; the penalty for this latest dangerous move was a disqualification. The maneuver could very easily have resulted in a major crash. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stands in stark contrast to the penalty for a nearly identical move from Dylan Groenewegen, which had far more disastrous consequences but was, at its core, not any worse than what Bouhanni did on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jury&#8217;s decision at Cholet-Pays de la Loire further amplifies the arbitrary feel of Groenewegen&#8217;s nine-month ban. Groenewegen&#8217;s maneuver at the Tour of Poland was no more (and possibly less) egregious, but the outcome was compounded by a complete failure of the barriers, resulting in a disastrous crash and horrible injuries. The disparity in penalty, given nearly identical transgressions, is jarring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the current rules, the UCI clearly penalizes outcomes, not actions. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BouhanniNacer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BouhanniNacer</a> I would ask you what you was thinking&#8230;but you clearly have no brain cells.
