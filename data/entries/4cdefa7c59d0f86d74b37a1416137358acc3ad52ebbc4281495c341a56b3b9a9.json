In the past, hackers claimed to have <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3184069/hackers-threaten-to-wipe-millions-of-apple-devices-demand-ransom.html\">millions of stolen iCloud credentials</a> are demanded Apple pay a ransom (ZDNet obtained a sample set of credentials and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-icloud-ransom-what-you-need-to-know/&amp;xcust=1-1-229795-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">determined they were real)</a>. So even as Apple does what it can to protect your data, events like this—though unlikely–can happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nBut guess what? Using two-factor authentication should protect you completely. It’s easy to set up, so take a minute and do it now.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nYou used to be able to set up two-factor on the account settigs page at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://appleid.apple.com&amp;xcust=1-1-229795-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">appleid.apple.com</a>, but now this has to be done on a Mac or iOS device. (Apple ID users who don’t have a compatible device can still use an older two-step verification system—see below for more.)\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone and iPad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these steps on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. These steps are done with iOS 14.5 and should be similar in iPadOS 14.5. The device must be protected with a passcode (<em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Touch ID/Face ID and Passcode</em>). </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ios14-two-factor-2fa.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption><p>Once you set up two-factor on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll see a code pop up when you try to log in to iCloud anywhere else. If you don’t see a pop-up or get a text message, you can come back to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Apple ID</em> &gt; <em>Password &amp; Security</em> and tap <em>Get Verification Code</em>.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Launch the Settings app.</li><li>Tap your Apple ID profile at the top. Obviously you need to be signed in with the account you want to protect with two-factor authentication.</li><li>Tap <em>Password &amp; Security</em>. </li><li>Find the <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> setting and turn it on<em>.</em></li><li>Next, enter a phone number where you can receive a text message or a phone call with a two-factor code. You can also specify if you want a text or a call. </li><li>You’ll get that text message or call and enter the six-digit verification code on the next screen.</li><li>That’s it! Two-factor is on, and this is your official Trusted Device. The next time you sign on to iCloud.com, or set up your iCloud account on a new device, you’ll have to first enter your username and password, and then be prompted to enter a code. That code will come in a pop-up on your trusted device, texted/phoned to the number you provided, or, you can come back to this screen and tap Get Verification Code.</li></ol><h2>Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> Setting this up on a Mac is nearly the same steps as on an iPhone or iPad. These instructions are done with macOS Big Sur 11.3.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Open System Preferences.</li><li>In your profile at the top, click <em>Apple ID</em>.</li><li>The Apple ID pane should open. In the left column, click on <em>Password &amp; Security</em>.</li><li>Find the <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> setting and turn it on<em>.</em></li><li>You might need to verify your identity by answering your security questions.</li><li>Enter a phone number you can use to receive verification codes, and choose if you want to get text messages or calls.</li><li>Enter the code that’s sent you to right away to finish up.</li></ol><div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/macos-big-sur-two-factor-2fa.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If your Mac is running macOS Mojave or an earlier operating system, here are the instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Open System Preferences </li><li>Select <em>iCloud</em>. Click the <em>Account Details</em> button, and sign in if prompted.</li><li>In the Security tab, click the button labeled <em>Turn on two-factor authentication</em>. Read the message and click <em>Continue</em>.</li><li>Verify your identity by answering your security questions.</li><li>Enter a phone number you can use to receive verification codes, and choose if you want to get text messages or calls.</li><li>Enter the code that’s sent you to right away to finish up.</li></ol><h2>What if my device is too old?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> If your Mac is using an operating system older than El Capitan, or your iOS device isn’t running iOS 9 or later, you can still use <em>two-step verification</em>, which is slightly different than <em>two-factor authentication</em>, mostly because it relies on a text message being sent to a phone number, while the newer “authentication” is baked more seamlessly into the OSes. Plus, the older verification method requires you to hold onto a <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3099208/security/tune-up-your-two-step-recovery-key.html\">Recovery Key</a> in case you ever lose your password. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/03/two_factor_mac_popup-100715044-large.jpg\" /><figcaption><p>\nTwo-step verification always sends you a text message. With the newer two-factor authentication, you’ll get this cool pop-up on nearby trusted devices signed in to the same iCloud account. \n</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>\nYou can read <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152&amp;xcust=1-1-229795-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">more about the differences from Apple</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3123791/os-x/unlocking-a-mac-with-an-apple-watch-requires-two-factor-not-two-step-icloud-protectionwhat.html\">from our own Glenn Fleishman</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nApple still provides a way to enable two-step verification, by following <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleid.apple.com/manage/security/2sv/enrollment&amp;xcust=1-1-229795-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">this link</a>, signing in, and following the instructions.\n</p>\n</div>","author":"Susie Ochs","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4cdefa7c59d0f86d74b37a1416137358acc3ad52ebbc4281495c341a56b3b9a9","category":"Apple"}
