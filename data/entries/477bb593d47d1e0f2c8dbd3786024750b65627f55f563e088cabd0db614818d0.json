That’s the largest number\nin any single quarter since IDC started tracking smartphones,\nanalyst Francisco Jeronimo said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>90 million total units — in one quarter — puts some context to reports that Apple has dialed back production of the iPhone 12 Mini by 2 million. Even if it’s true that Apple is ordering <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/22/iphone-12-mini-production/\">2 million fewer 12 Minis</a> than they originally projected (and I don’t believe any such reports — no little birdies I’ve ever spoken to have ever given any credence whatsoever to reports like that) the 12 Mini could easily be selling well enough to justify its continuing position in the lineup. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3603043/my-precious-show-some-love-for-the-iphone-12-mini.html\">Stay strong, Macalope</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, these strong sales for the iPhone 12 lineup call for some delicious claim chowder.
