Currently, WhatsApp on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lets users back up their chat history to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, but messages and media that users back up are not protected by WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption while in ‌&zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple holds the encryption keys to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and does provide backed-up data to authorities when lawfully requested, as outlined in its semiannual <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/\">Transparency Reports</a>. The new WhatsApp feature, should it see the light of day, would resolve that security hole by allowing users to encrypt and password-protect their chat history before uploading it to Apple's cloud-based platform.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn screenshots <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1368839686102384640?s=20\">posted</a> by WABetaInfo, WhatsApp describes the password-protection like so:\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"To prevent unauthorized access to your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/\">iCloud Drive</a> backup, you can set a password that will be used to encrypt future backups. This password will be required when you restore from the backup.\"</blockquote>The user is then asked to confirm their phone number and select a password of at least eight characters in length. Another screenshot forewarns users that \"WhatsApp will not be able to help recover forgotten passwords.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">• The chat database is already encrypted now (excluding media), but the algorithm is reversible and it&#39;s not end-to-end encrypted. <br>• Local Android backups will be compatible with this feature.<br><br>The chat DB and media will be encrypted using a password that only you know. <a href=\"https://t.co/WAliLUnF18\">https://t.co/WAliLUnF18</a></p>&mdash; WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1368839686102384640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's unclear when the security feature will go live, but after the recent exodus from WhatsApp prompted by the service's poorly explained <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp-privacy-policy-data-sharing-facebook/\">privacy policy update</a>, sooner would be better than later. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRival encrypted messaging services Telegram and Signal have both experienced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/messaging-app-signal-sees-surge-signups/\">surge in signups</a> following the controversy, which led WhatsApp to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-privacy-policy-delay/\">delay</a> the privacy policy update until May while it attempts to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/12/whatsapp-affirms-user-privacy-following-backlash/\">deal with the fallout</a> and clarify to users that the changes won't affect the privacy of their conversations.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/whatsapp-working-on-encrypted-icloud-backups/\">WhatsApp Still Working on Password-Protected Encrypted iCloud Backups</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-still-working-on-password-protected-encrypted-icloud-backups.2287516/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OdwmD-A2Wpw:KGaugSm-Iu8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OdwmD-A2Wpw:KGaugSm-Iu8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OdwmD-A2Wpw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c87e5614ec4aca0010a426d48a7c7a775c424e9ba56f62ce7f0a8dcb9f0eef2e","category":"Apple"}
