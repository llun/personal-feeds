In late 2020, its board of directors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/23/iphone-pegatron-150m-investment-india/\">approved</a> a proposal to spend &#36;150 million to build its first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing plant in the country. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPegatron has been cleared to take part in India's billion-dollar Production-Linked Incentive Scheme, which provides incentives on locally-produced smartphones. The Taipei-based assembler joins rival ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron, which are already signed up to the scheme.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPegatron has also established a Vietnam-based wholly-owned subsidiary, Pegatron Vietnam, with initial paid-in capital of &#36;150 million, some of which was used in late 2020 to acquire land in Haiphong, where it plans to set up a production base.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; assembler recently drew the ire of Apple after it was discovered that the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ supplier had been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/09/apple-suspends-pegatron-labor-violations/\">committing labor violations</a> at a student workers' program at its Shanghai and Kunshan campuses in eastern China.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple put Pegatron on probation as a result of the violations, and while the supplier's current ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ business is not expected to be affected, it could lose some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> orders to rival Luxshare next year.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pegatron/\">Pegatron</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/pegatron-buys-land-iphone-assembly-india/\">iPhone Assembler Pegatron Acquires Land for Production Base in India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-assembler-pegatron-acquires-land-for-production-base-in-india.2285186/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lbWBDViwpUg:3-Z4cz4dbyE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lbWBDViwpUg:3-Z4cz4dbyE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lbWBDViwpUg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a04d8507b63618c1a7a348061810df0ca8b866aff67ffb6b9370d87386a48b1","category":"Apple"}
