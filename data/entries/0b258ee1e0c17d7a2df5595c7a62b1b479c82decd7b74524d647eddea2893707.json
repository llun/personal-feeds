{"title":"More on Night Shift and Sleep Benefits","link":"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/05/05/night-shift-sleep-study/","date":1620320121000,"content":"\n<p>Michael Tsai, regarding <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/04/byu-night-shift\">that BYU study</a> suggesting that Night Shift doesn’t really offer any sleep benefits:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sleep benefits or not, I do find it more comfortable. Perhaps\nBYU’s results differ from previous studies because Night Shift\nshifts the colors much less than f.lux or blue light glasses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve long heard from friends and readers who enjoy Night Shift (and <a href=\"https://justgetflux.com/\">f.lux</a>) simply because they feel it reduces eye strain. Comfort is comfort — if you Night Shift feels easier on your eyes, go ahead and use it. What I object to is the “may help you get a better night’s sleep” claim. Apple should keep the feature but change the language describing it to remove any suggestion that it’s a sleep aid, unless subsequent studies suggest otherwise. Describe it as something that “may reduce eye strain” or something.</p>\n\n<p>For every person who genuinely enjoys Night Shift, I wonder how many people are using it despite thinking that it’s ugly because they believe this description from Apple that it might improve their sleep?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/06/more-on-night-shift\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0b258ee1e0c17d7a2df5595c7a62b1b479c82decd7b74524d647eddea2893707","category":"Tech"}
