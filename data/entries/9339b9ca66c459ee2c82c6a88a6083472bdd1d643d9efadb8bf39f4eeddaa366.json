Over the same three months, the company built a total of 206,421 EVs. <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q2-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries\">In a short statement</a>, the company wrote that its \"teams have done an outstanding job navigating through global supply chain and logistics challenges.\"</p>\n<p>Almost all of those Teslas were Models 3 or Y, reflecting the fact that buyers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/tesla-model-s-to-get-comprehensive-refresh-200mph-plaid-version/\">have been waiting</a> for the recent refresh of the bigger, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/tesla-takes-aim-at-upstarts-with-390-mile-range-200-mph-model-s-plaid/\">faster</a>, more expensive Models S and X. But it was an excellent quarter for the American automaker, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/tesla-posts-another-record-quarterly-profit-and-wall-street-shrugs/\">beating Q1 2021's already impressive numbers</a>.</p>\n<p>Other automakers with new EVs have been releasing sales numbers over the past couple of days as well. Looked at individually, the numbers are encouraging for EV advocates. For example, Porsche has delivered 5,367 Taycans so far this year, actually outselling the 911 by 259 cars. Ford sold 12,975 Mustang Mach-Es during the first half of the year, and the Mach-E beat the two-door Mustangs by 225 cars. And VW delivered 6,230 ID.4s from January through June, which is definitely a start.Â Zoom out, and the scale of Tesla's EV advantage comes clearly into view. (These are all US sales numbers however and Tesla only releases global numbers.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777861#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777861&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
