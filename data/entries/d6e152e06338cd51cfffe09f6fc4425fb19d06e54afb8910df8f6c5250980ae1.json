{"title":"Markdown Improvements to Apple’s Developer Forums","link":"https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/681081","date":1622216494000,"content":"\n<p>The mononymous Quinn outlines his favorite new improvements to Apple’s Developer Forums, most of which are Markdown-related. I will admit that I find this satisfying. Here’s one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Markdown parser now supports out-of-line links. For example, you can ‘spell’ the previous link as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>link to the [Wikipedia &gt; Service set (802.11 network)][refSs81n] page\n\n[refSs81n]: &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_set_(802.11_network)&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Personally I prefer this style because I find that the long links get in my way while crafting my text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know inline links — <code>[like this](http://example.com/)</code> — are overwhelmingly more popular with Markdown users, but I personally much prefer the reference style for exactly the reason Quinn does. The inline style is easier, and I’d never argue against laziness as a virtue, but the reference style is just so much more readable.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/28/quinn-devforums-markdown\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d6e152e06338cd51cfffe09f6fc4425fb19d06e54afb8910df8f6c5250980ae1","category":"Tech"}
