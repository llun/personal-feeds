The cardiac devices have switches that respond to an external magnet to change how the device functions, which allows them to be controlled without the requirement of surgery. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCurious about potential interference with electrical devices, Dr. Singh and his colleagues took an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> and passed it over the chest of a patient with an implantable defibrillator. \r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"When we brought the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; close to the patient's chest the defibrillator was deactivated,\" said Dr. Singh. \"We saw on the external defibrillator programmer that the functions of the device were suspended and remained suspended. When we took the phone away from the patient's chest, the defibrillator immediately returned to its normal function.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"We were all stunned,\" he said. \"We had assumed that the magnet would be too weak in a phone to trip the defibrillator’s magnetic switch.\"</blockquote>The findings are significant, since Dr. Singh is an expert in the use of devices such as implantable defibrillators that detect an irregular heartbeat and shock the heart back into a normal rhythm, and pacemakers that use electricity to keep the heart beating. Following the discovery, Dr. Singh and his colleagues immediately submitted a report of their findings to the <em>HeartRhythm</em> medical journal that was published on January 4, 2021.\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"We believe our findings have profound implications on a large scale for the people who live daily with these devices, who without thinking, will place their phone in their shirt pocket or upper pocket or their coat – not knowing that it can cause their defibrillator or pacemaker to function in a way that could potentially be lethal.\"</blockquote><div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J6T3H9kvnEE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe comments underline medical evidence <a href=\"https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(20)31227-3/fulltext\">published in January</a> which cautioned that ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ models and related &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; devices can \"potentially inhibit lifesaving therapy in a patient\" due to magnetic interference with implanted medical devices.
