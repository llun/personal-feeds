And even for the not-yet-vaccinated, they’re relaxing outdoor masking guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>We’re not going to have a snap-our-fingers moment where things suddenly “go back to normal”. It’s been a traumatic, dramatic year — and our path back to normalcy (even if it’s a new normal) will be incremental, one step at a time.
