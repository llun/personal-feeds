In Q4 2019, 7.3 percent of US-based subscribers used over 1TB. (The weighted figures include both users with data caps and users with unlimited plans.)</p>\n<p>The 14.1 percent figure is also a big jump from Q3 2020, when <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/broadband-power-users-explode-making-data-caps-more-profitable-for-isps/\">OpenVault research found</a> that 8.8 percent of broadband subscribers used at least 1TB per month. The 1TB figure is significant because AT&amp;T and other ISPs impose <a href=\"https://www.att.com/support/article/u-verse-high-speed-internet/KM1010099/\">monthly data caps of 1TB</a> or less. Comcast raised its cap to 1.2TB starting in mid-2020, while Cox's is now up to <a href=\"https://www.cox.com/residential/support/understanding-data-usage.html\">1.25TB</a>. People using 1TB on a capped service are at risk of paying overage fees, which generally cost $10 for each additional block of 50GB.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741225#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741225&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a76d1d029a483a16c552313e7f44fbf471a6704fc918e26a8447bc998d409a30","category":"Tech"}
