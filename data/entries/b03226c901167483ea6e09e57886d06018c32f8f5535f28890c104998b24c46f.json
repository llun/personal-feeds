Zwift’s new Makuri Islands world offers a change of scenery right from the comfort/discomfort (delete as applicable) of your indoor trainer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Inspired by Japanese culture”, Yumezi is the first map on the Makuri Islands world and is open now. Expect more maps to follow – Zwift says the Makuri Islands world is “primed for future expansion”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Yumezi map is the Islands’ countryside destination and features various roads, “from tight, flat, winding roads ideal for fast races, to dirt roads and cobbled market streets.” It comes just in time to offer some extra motivation if you listened to the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/nerd-alert-podcast-summer-is-coming-but-dont-put-your-trainer-away-quite-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Nerd Alert podcast</a> on the benefits of maintaining some amount of indoor training even with improving weather in the northern hemisphere. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Zwift-Makuri-Islands-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Yumezi is “a fantastical countryside destination, inspired by<br />Japanese culture”</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Zwift-Makuri-Islands-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Yumezi is the first map on the new Makuri Islands virtual world.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Zwift explains: “Yumezi (yu-meh-zi ᐧ夢路) means ‘path to dreams.’ Yumezi is a Japanese haiku-inspired name, with its two characters (夢路) taken from a poem by renowned Meiji-era poet, Shiki Masaoka.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yumezi is bursting with lush green fields, ginkgo forests, cherry blossom trees, waterfalls, temples, and all sorts of wildlife.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift has packed eight new routes into 53 miles (85 km) of Yumezi roads, offering <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/zwifthub-lives-on-last-minute-acquisition-saves-the-zwift-app/\" target=\"_blank\">plenty more badges and achievements to track</a>.
