More notable still was that, according to the vulnerable code itself, a Western Digital developer actively removed code that required a valid user password before allowing factory resets to proceed.</p>\n<h2>Done and undone</h2>\n<p>The undocumented vulnerability resided in a file aptly named system_factory_restore. It contains a PHP script that performs resets, allowing users to restore all default configurations and wipe all data stored on the devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776939#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776939&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fabb0ddb8f6e77d4ca40e118ff324bf54ab66bf736b0af2e31b53a943f02f0e1","category":"Tech"}
