The plugin apparently required \"a fair amount\" of manual configuration and presented a few warnings, but it works correctly just like many other HomeBridge-based workarounds for ‌HomeKit‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/jaguar-homekit-climate-control-2.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nMany functions of the vehicle, including climate control, pre-conditioning, locking and unlocking, and charging, are now viewable and controllable in the Home app from any location.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/jaguar-homekit-home-app.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIntegration into the Home app allows automations to be created based on battery level, such as automatically charging the car from a HomeKit-enabled power outlet when the battery percentage is low. Ellis also has an automation to pre-condition the temperature of the car and its batteries based on events in the Calendar app. It is also possible to automatically unlock the car at a time of day or under certain conditions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo accompany the Apple-oriented vehicle upgrades, Ellis added wireless <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>. Jaguar does not support wireless ‌CarPlay‌, but Ellis was able to implement the feature herself using a wireless ‌CarPlay‌ adapter called <a href=\"https://cplay2air.com\">CPLAY2air</a>. Ellis also mounted a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charger on the dashboard for convenient <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> charging.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/magsafe-on-dashboard.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough this setup has to be created manually via HomeBridge, it shows how it may be useful to add a vehicle to ‌HomeKit‌. Integration with ‌HomeKit‌ opens up the possibility of creating useful Shortcuts as well as Home automations for the vehicle.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith services such as ‌CarPlay‌ available in most new vehicles, new services such as Car Keys expanding, and Apple collaborating with brands such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/\">BMW</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/20/porsche-taycan-integrated-apple-music/\">Porsche</a> to bring <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/22/taycan-gains-apple-podcasts-and-apple-music-lyrics/\">Apple-integrated features</a> to vehicles, it is not inconceivable to think that an official ‌HomeKit‌ integration for cars could be added in the future, especially in view of proof-of-concept projects such as this.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home/\">Home</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jaguar/\">Jaguar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wireless-carplay/\">wireless CarPlay</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/user-adds-car-to-homekit/\">User Adds Car to HomeKit for In-App Controls and Automations, Showing Future Potential</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/user-adds-car-to-homekit-for-in-app-controls-and-automations-showing-future-potential.2291783/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-bu6UOUSUek:n6D818fi2gY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-bu6UOUSUek:n6D818fi2gY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-bu6UOUSUek\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"69d8c9af33bb5eea612b7d793593bd060fa3eed3c566ba7ab5c534ae1aa59211","category":"Apple"}
