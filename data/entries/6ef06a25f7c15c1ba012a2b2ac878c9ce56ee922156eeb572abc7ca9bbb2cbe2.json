Developers are no longer able to access the advertising identifier of your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> without your express permission, which will prevent developers from tracking you across apps and websites for ad targeting preferences.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nIf that sounds confusing, Apple has created an App Tracking Transparency video that's now available on YouTube, walking through what the changes mean. \"It's a feature that gives you a choice,\" says the voiceover in the video. \"A choice on how apps use and share your data.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe video goes on to describe the kinds of data that apps have access to like location, age, health information, spending habits, and browsing history.
