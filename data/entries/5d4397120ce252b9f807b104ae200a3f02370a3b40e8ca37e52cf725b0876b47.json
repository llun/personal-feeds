{"title":"Were the Airline Bailouts Really Needed?","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/business/dealbook/airline-bailouts.html","date":1616014222000,"content":"\n<p>Andrew Ross Sorkin, writing for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is fair to say that we socialized the airline industry’s losses\nand largely privatized the gains.</p>\n\n<p>No other industry affected by the pandemic received more from the\ngovernment. There was no special program for hotels or restaurants\nor travel agencies. Companies in those industries had to line up\nfor the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program and\npray. The largest loan the program could make was $10 million.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn’t whether airline employees should have been\nhelped, it’s whether airline shareholders should have been. The\nairline bailouts weren’t simply a job-protection program, as\nadvertised. In case you’re not convinced, there’s this: United\ninvested $20 million into an electric helicopter company last\nmonth that went public through a special purpose acquisition\ncompany, or SPAC. Does that sound like a company that is in such\ndire straits that it requires a taxpayer-funded bailout? It\nreceived a third rescue payment after it made the investment.</p>\n\n<p>With the stock market now soaring, it is worth considering whether\nthe airlines needed taxpayer money at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pairs well — albeit frustratingly — with <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/17/saving-restaurants\">my previous item</a>. Sorkin points out that a big part of the “privatized profits” is that when business is good, the airlines pump their profits into stock buybacks, rather than saving for a rainy day (or pandemic year). Restaurants don’t have that option — they run on tight margins and generally slim profits even when business is good.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, there are big airline-size corporations that run massive restaurant chains. A bailout that focused on privately-held restaurants would have been one way to start.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Were the Airline Bailouts Really Needed?’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/17/sorkin-airline-bailouts\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5d4397120ce252b9f807b104ae200a3f02370a3b40e8ca37e52cf725b0876b47","category":"Tech"}
