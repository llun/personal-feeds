We picked the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zFMY0G\">Forerunner 45</a> as our favorite runner’s watch while the Vivo series took top honors as the most stylish. Both devices are seeing record discounts for Prime Day. We especially like some older models of the Vivomove. Today's discounts bring the newer versions, the Vivoactive 4 and 4s, down to about the same price.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775031#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775031&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"41bbe1b1ee8cd538fbc85176259facd46eb413c91a8ad601993f4e78dfc97f60","category":"Tech"}
