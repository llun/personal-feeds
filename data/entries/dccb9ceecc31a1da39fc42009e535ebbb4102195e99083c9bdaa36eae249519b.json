{"title":"Liv launches new Langma Disc brake bike for 2022","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/liv-launches-new-langma-disc-brake-bike-for-2022/","date":1622568118000,"content":"<p>Liv, the for-women by-women bike brand started by Bonnie Tu, launched their new Langma Advanced SL Disc, a race-specific road bike that Women’s WorldTour team Liv Racing has been racing on most of the Spring. Liv is offering 11 different variations of the new Langma for a host of different cyclists, from racing at the top level or loving the freedom a bike can offer on the weekends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First debuted in 2017, this newly re-imagined Langma has a handful of improvements on the first-generation Langma. The top of the range Advanced SL Disc bills itself as the ultra-light top end option offering performance to match. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new frame weighs in 60 grams lighter than the earlier version thanks to new longer, more continuous pieces of carbon fibre which also result in a claimed increase in frame stiffness. With this increased stiffness Liv has also found an increase in the new bike’s stiffness to weight ratio, which it suggests offers better acceleration and ride characteristics. The fully-carbon Variant SLR seatpost adds to the lighter frame coming in at 141g, and Liv has also knocked 30g off the fork of the Advanced Pro Disc and 8g off the other models. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv made more changes to the fork than just weight, with 50% more lateral stiffness than the outgoing model, Liv claims the bike offers precise and responsive handling. The oversized headset, Liv Contact SLR handlebar, and space for up to 32mm tires further helps in the handling department. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv has stuck with the truncated tubing in the frame for improved aerodynamics but thankfully has found a neater way to integrate the seat post clamp. The headtube has also seen a redesign with a more fluid looking design on the new bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are committed to designing the most technologically advanced bikes on the market and the new Langma Disc range is no exception,” said Phoebe Liu, chief branding officer for Giant Group, which includes Liv, Giant, Momentum and CADEX brands. “This bike builds on the success of the original design as an all-around performance race bike that excels at climbing and is made for riders to confidently push their limits.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LivRacingWorldTeam_Training2_phMichielMaas-1340x893.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Last year our WorldTeam tested prototypes and we incorporated their feedback into the final design. We updated its geometry for wider tire compatibility, optimized the stiffness-to-weight ratio and improved the bike’s overall aero advantage,” said Sophia Shih, lead engineer of on-road development for Liv Cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv Racing has proved the Langma is competitive in both sprints and while climbing. Lotte Kopecky won Le Samyn des Dames in early March and claimed second at Gent-Wevelgem on the Langma while Pauliena Rooijakkers climbed to fourth on the final brutal climb of the Vuelta a Burgos Feminas in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CORVOS_00033175-034-1340x870.jpg\" /><figcaption>Lotte Kopecky wins at the LOTTO Thüringen Ladies Tour in Germany. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire range includes the Langma Advanced SL Disc, three variations of the Langma Advanced Pro Disc, and seven versions of the Langma Advanced Disc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MY22-Langma-Advanced-Pro-1-Disc_Color-A-Fanatic-Teal-1340x786.jpg\" /><figcaption>Langma Advanced Pro Disc in Fanatic Teal</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for colour options, depending on the model and where in the world you are, the Langma features Xirallic®or Colorstream® thin coatings in a few different hues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like the colours, pricing for the new Langma varies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-level <strong>Langma Advanced SL Disc</strong> is $10,000 / AU$12,999 and is equipped with Cadex 36 Disc wheel system and SRAM RED eTap AXS hydraulic groupset, Quarq DZero power meter. The top of the line model comes in Tiger Red and Chrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One level down, the <strong>Langma Advanced Pro Disc 0 AXS </strong>comes with SRAM Force eTap AXS hydraulic groupset, Giant Halo power meter, and Giant SLR 1 36 Disc WheelSystem and will cost £5,599/ AU$7,499 with the price to be decided in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, Liv offers the <strong>Langma Advanced Pro Disc 1 </strong>with SRAM Rival eTap AXS hydraulic groupset, the same power meter and wheels as the Advanced Pro Disc 0. The price for this model with SRAM has not yet been set by Liv, but with the Shimano Ultegra groupset, it will be £3,999 / AU$5,499. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the <strong>Langma Advanced 2 Disc</strong> at £2,349 / $2,500 / AU$3,299 comes with Shimano 105 hydraulic groupset and P-R2 Disc wheelset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the new Langma <a href=\"https://www.liv-cycling.com/global/langma\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/liv-launches-new-langma-disc-brake-bike-for-2022/\">Liv launches new Langma Disc brake bike for 2022</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"dccb9ceecc31a1da39fc42009e535ebbb4102195e99083c9bdaa36eae249519b","category":"Cycling"}
