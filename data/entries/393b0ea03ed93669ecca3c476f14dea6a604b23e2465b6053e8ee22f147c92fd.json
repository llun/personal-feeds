(credit: Teri Sheehan)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>A Microsoft Windows Update is wreaking havoc with printers worldwide this week—<code>KB50000802</code> (for newer Windows 10 builds; older Windows 10 and Server builds may have a KB ending in <code>808</code> or <code>822</code> instead) was intended to provide updates to security \"when Windows performs basic operations,\" but the update crashes some print drivers due to overflowing a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/gdi-objects\">GDI Object</a> limit of 10,000.</p>\n<p>The bug afflicts a wide range of printers and print drivers, as <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2021/03/10/windows-10-kb5000802-march-update-is-crashing-pcs-with-bsod/\">reported</a> by WindowsLatest earlier this week. We can confirm having seen the issue on a Windows 10 2004 PC, which crashes with <code>APC_INDEX_MISMATCH</code> (photo above) after printing to any of several models of Kyocera printer (some local, some network).</p>\n<p>If you're afflicted with this bug yourself, you can get some relief by uninstalling KB50000802 until Microsoft comes out with a fixed update, presumably by April's Patch Tuesday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748905#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748905&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"393b0ea03ed93669ecca3c476f14dea6a604b23e2465b6053e8ee22f147c92fd","category":"Tech"}
