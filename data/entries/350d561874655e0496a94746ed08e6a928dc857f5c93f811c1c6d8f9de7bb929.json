{"title":"iOS 15: How to Rearrange and Delete Home Screen Pages","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/rearrange-delete-home-screen-pages-ios/","date":1624056663000,"content":"In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, Apple lets you disable individual <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> pages thanks to the App Library, which is available to keep your apps better organized. However, not everyone gets on with the App Library, and it's not possible to rearrange the order of your ‌‌Home Screen‌‌ pages, nor can you delete a page outright rather than merely disabling it. In ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>‌, though, you ‌can do both. Here's how it works.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iOS-15-General-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>How to Rearrange Home Screen Pages</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>Touch and hold a space on the ‌Home Screen‌ to enter jiggle mode.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap the row of dots representing your ‌Home Screen‌ pages.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>In the ‌Home Screen‌ grid that appears, touch and drag a page to rearrange it in relation to your other pages.
