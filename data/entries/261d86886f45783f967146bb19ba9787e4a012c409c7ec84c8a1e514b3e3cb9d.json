You can\nreset an AirTag by tapping with an iPhone or “NFC-capable device” — strange wording that implies maybe other non-Apple devices?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I talked to folks from Apple today about some of this. The timeout period for when an AirTag will play a sound if separated from its owner is currently three days — but that’s not baked into the AirTags themselves. It’s a server-side setting in the Find My network, so Apple can adjust it if real-world use suggests that three days is too long or too short.</p>\n\n<p>The “NFC-capable device” thing means Android phones.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/20/moren-fine-print\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"261d86886f45783f967146bb19ba9787e4a012c409c7ec84c8a1e514b3e3cb9d","category":"Tech"}
