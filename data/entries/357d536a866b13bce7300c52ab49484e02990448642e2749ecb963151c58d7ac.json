Walmart says orders will ship on May 24.</p>\n<p>While our review of the new slates is still forthcoming, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/ipad-pro-upgraded-from-a-series-cpu-to-full-m1/\" target=\"_blank\">latest iPad Pro comes with</a> the M1 chip <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/mac-mini-and-apple-silicon-m1-review-not-so-crazy-after-all/\" target=\"_blank\">that has impressed us</a> in other recent Apple devices. It also has a more future-proof Thunderbolt port and an ostensibly improved front-facing camera. The 11-inch model here does <em>not</em> come with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/new-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-and-24-inch-imac-now-available-for-order/\" target=\"_blank\">upgraded Mini LED display</a> of the 12.9-inch version, however. In any case, this will likely continue to be a more niche device for power users, while the iPad Air should <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/ipad-air-2020-review-semi-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">remain an appealing compromise</a> for consumers looking to pay a bit less. But if you're dead set on upgrading to Apple's top-end option, any savings might be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>If you're not interested in shelling out that much for an iPad, our deals roundup also has discounts on various Amazon devices, including a much cheaper tablet in the Amazon Fire HD 8, as well as deals on Sony noise-canceling headphones, Roku streamers, a wide variety of video games, and much more.
