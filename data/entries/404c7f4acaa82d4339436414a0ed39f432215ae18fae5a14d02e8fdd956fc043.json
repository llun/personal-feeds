Heightened by the global health crisis, millions have switched to working remotely via ‌FaceTime‌, Zoom, and other platforms. Often, coming with it is the embarrassment of trying to talk, only to discover later that no one heard you due to your muted microphone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is aiming to solve this social dilemma with ‌iOS 15‌. Unfortunately, on ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 1, a similar prompt is not present, but it may be added in a future beta release. Another ‌FaceTime‌ feature coming this fall is the ability to share ‌FaceTime‌ call links with others, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/facetime-pc-android-users-ios-15/\">including those on Android and Windows</a>, brand-new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-features-spatial-audio/\">SharePlay functionality</a>, and more. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/ios-15-facetime-reminder-while-muted/\">FaceTime on iOS 15 Alerts You If You Try to Talk While Muted</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facetime-on-ios-15-alerts-you-if-you-try-to-talk-while-muted.2300259/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rRhfy6lLs9E:Xq68J3kH664:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rRhfy6lLs9E:Xq68J3kH664:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rRhfy6lLs9E\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"404c7f4acaa82d4339436414a0ed39f432215ae18fae5a14d02e8fdd956fc043","category":"Apple"}
