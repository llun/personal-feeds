Woolnut makes a range of high-quality sleeve options available in sizes to fit Apple's modern iPads.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/woolnut-ipad-folio.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1775\" height=\"999\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790935\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nPriced at around &#36;160 (135 euros), the <a href=\"https://www.woolnut.com/shop/tablets/ipd11/ipd-pro-11-folio-black/\">Leather Folio for iPad Pro and Air</a> is sized to fit the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and the first and second-generation 11-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, while the <a href=\"https://www.woolnut.com/shop/tablets/ipd12/ipd-pro-12-folio-black/\">Leather Folio for iPad Pro</a> (available for &#36;173) is compatible with the third and fourth-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBecause the upcoming 2021 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models that are rumored to be coming soon will feature the same 11 and 12.9-inch sizes, Woolnut's existing folios should be compatible with the new models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/woolnut-ipad-folio-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1242\" height=\"358\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790936\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nMade from soft, full-grain Scandinavian leather, the Leather Folios are lined with 100 percent natural wool felt sourced from Germany. The wool has water-repellent and shock absorbing properties to keep the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> inside safe.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEach folio is sized to fit the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and accessories that include the Magic Keyboard and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, with a dedicated holder for the Pencil.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/woolnut-folio-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"986\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790937\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Leather Folios come in three colors that include Black, Cognac, and Green, and each zips down the side with a high-end YKK Excella zipper sourced from Japan. Over time, the leather of the Folio will develop a unique patina for a custom look for each user.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe have four Leather Folios from Woolnut to give to <em>MacRumors</em> readers, with each winner able to choose their preferred folio.
