The conference will be held June 7-11 and will once again adhere to an all-online format that is free for all developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Worldwide Developers Conference traditionally kicks off with a keynote at 10am PT on the first day of the event June 7 that will &ldquo;offer unique insight into the future of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS,&rdquo; and hopefully bring a few surprises along the way. New Apple silicon-powered iMacs and MacBooks are heavily rumored to arrive this year and could show up at the event. Earlier today, it was revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342024/after-20-years-of-os-x-macos-11-might-be-gone-after-big-sur.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342024/after-20-years-of-os-x-macos-11-might-be-gone-after-big-sur.html\">next version of macOS</a> will likely be version 12 and not 11.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the announcement, Apple said WWDC 2021 will &ldquo;include announcements from the keynote and State of the Union stages, online sessions, 1:1 labs offering technical guidance, and new ways for developers to interact with Apple engineers and designers to learn about the latest frameworks and technologies.&rdquo; Apple is also committing $1 million to SJ Aspires, an education and equity initiative launched by the City of San Jos&eacute;, as part of its $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event image, a red-haired Memoji character is wearing  glasses that reflect a June 7 Calendar icon showing an unread badge with the number 21. You can also see icons for Xcode and a few others out of view. More information will be available as the event nears.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Google Maps can now give you directions inside a mall or airport","siteHash":"2630f990a97c0fb1c464acf767310f86292d38708c1b5c81971b6e1c2a08ae5b","entryHash":"d020cef3ed17dca7b3352381c5c506ccd895eb84179325247ab2b80e7413a82d","category":"Apple"}
