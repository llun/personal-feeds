The GC superstar has built a reputation for his long training hours in the saddle, and although his career appears to be on the wane since a violent crash in 2019, he continues to put in the work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His most recent training ride, taking in almost 150 km and 4,000 metres of climbing including some gravel stints, was noteworthy in a couple of ways. One: it’s quite a big, climb-y ride. Two: Froome <a href=\"https://perform.fm/r/3fwf\">posted his training playlist</a> … and it is a lot to come to terms with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here. Take a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/img-20210516-wa0002-1340x1340.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Track 14 gets it. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes a bit for me to criticise someone’s taste in music. I’ve got an open-door policy that extends from black metal to ambient electronica to mainstream pop and my favourite week of the year is Eurovision Song Contest. But there is something so endearingly odd about Froome’s choices that I think we really need to have a serious talk about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up: the sequencing is all over the place. There’s a mindsnapping run from track 18 onwards that includes a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1PvzSX_Sbs\" target=\"_blank\">minor 1999 single by Five</a>, followed by the Verve’s ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74\">Bitter Sweet Symphony’</a>, followed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPO76Jlnz6c\" target=\"_blank\">‘Gangsta’s Paradise’</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLAWPrCUQQ0\" target=\"_blank\">‘La Bamba’</a> as a chaser. Carly Rae Jepsen (an absolute queen) appears thrice – but only her most earwormy singles and in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HmzwI67ec\">Owl City collaboration</a>. Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Nirvana, the Sugababes and Jack Johnson all make appearances.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most egregious is the inclusion of Mr President’s Coco Jamboo – a disaster of a song which I’ve had cause to <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/what-we-didnt-publish-during-lockdown/\">write about before</a> – nestled between a couple of wildly different (but quite good) one-hit-wonders. It’s a mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion: Chris Froome has always been kind of inscrutable, and this does not help matters. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/we-need-to-talk-about-chris-froomes-training-playlist/\">We need to talk about Chris Froome’s training playlist</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3ada7c21be82e440ebf965c097c50dab9fc255665140547e770e1d1d2b3c46b1","category":"Cycling"}
