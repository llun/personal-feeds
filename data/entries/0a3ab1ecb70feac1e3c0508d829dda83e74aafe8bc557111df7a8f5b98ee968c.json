Researchers say that Hafnium, a state-sponsored hacking group based in China, started exploiting ProxyLogon in January, and within a few weeks, five other APTs—short for advanced persistent threat groups—followed suit. To date, no fewer than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/security-unicorn-exchange-server-0-days-were-exploited-by-6-apts/\">10 APTs have used ProxyLogon</a> to target servers around the world.</p>\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/03/microsoft-issues-emergency-patches-for-4-exploited-0days-in-exchange/\">issued emergency patches</a> last week, but as of Tuesday, an estimated 125,000 Exchange servers had yet to install it, security firm Palo Alto Networks <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/remediation-steps-for-the-microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/\">said</a>. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have warned that ProxyLogon poses a serious threat to businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies that remain vulnerable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749055#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749055&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a3ab1ecb70feac1e3c0508d829dda83e74aafe8bc557111df7a8f5b98ee968c","category":"Tech"}
