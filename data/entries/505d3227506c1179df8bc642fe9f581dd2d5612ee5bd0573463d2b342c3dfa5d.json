Some iPad assembly, meanwhile, was postponed because of a\nshortage of displays and display components, sources said.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the delay, Apple has pushed back a portion of\ncomponent orders for the two devices from the first half of this\nyear to the second half, the people said. Industry sources and\nexperts say the delays are a sign that the chip shortage is\ngrowing more serious and could impact smaller tech players even\nmore heavily.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No word on <em>which</em> MacBook or iPad models, and Nikkei claims iPhone production hasn’t been affected yet. But, it seems possible that this might explain the fact that Apple hasn’t announced a spring special event yet — all-new iPad Pros are widely anticipated to be coming soon.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Nikkei Asia Report: ‘MacBook and iPad Production Delayed as Supply Crunch Hits Apple’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/08/nikkei-macbook-ipad-delays\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"505d3227506c1179df8bc642fe9f581dd2d5612ee5bd0573463d2b342c3dfa5d","category":"Tech"}
