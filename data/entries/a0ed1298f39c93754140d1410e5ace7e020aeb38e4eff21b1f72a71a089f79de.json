He drew inspiration from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ostrander\">John Ostrander</a>'s original 1980s <em>Suicide Squad</em> comics. (Ostrander has a small role in the final film.) Gunn <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-introduces-the-full-roster-of-bad-guys-james-gunn-is-bringing-to-theaters-dc-fandome/\">has described</a> his R-rated film as a superhero version of the classic 1967 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen\"><em>The Dirty Dozen</em></a>, selecting characters he described as \"loser, B-grade supervillains.\" And apparently, the studio is allowing him to <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/the-suicide-squad-james-gunn-relates-david-ayer-film-different-guardians-exclusive-images/\">kill off certain characters</a> as he sees fit, which should make for suspenseful viewing. (We're betting Harley Quinn will survive.)</p>\n<p>Per the official synopsis:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753962#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753962&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0ed1298f39c93754140d1410e5ace7e020aeb38e4eff21b1f72a71a089f79de","category":"Tech"}
