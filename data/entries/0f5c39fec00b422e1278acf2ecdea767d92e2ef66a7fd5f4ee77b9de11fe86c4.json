Apple trial.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/apple-generated-over-100-million-revenue-from-epic-s-fortnite\">Bloomberg</a></em>, Schmid offered the $100 million figure as a rough estimate, and declined to provide a specific dollar amount because that would be \"inappropriate.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSensor Tower last year estimated that Fortnite players have spent $1.2 billion on in-app purchases in the ‌App Store‌, which would have netted Apple $354 million. Fortnite has been on the ‌App Store‌ since 2018, and prior to its removal, it was a highly popular iOS game.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Schmid, Apple spent $1 million marketing for Fortnite in its last 11 months on the ‌App Store‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple software engineering chief Craig Federighi is testifying in the Epic v. Apple trial today, following <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a>'s testimony earlier this week.
