Prior to April 2, the company added new games to ‌Apple Arcade‌ intermittently on Fridays, similar to how <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> content is released, but since the launch of new categories of games two months ago, the service has seemingly taken a backseat.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/apple-arcade-orange-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOn April 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/apple-arcade-adds-30-classic-games/\">announced</a> that 30 new games would immediately arrive on the service, bringing the total number of games to over 180. Some of these games came under the new categories of \"Timeless Classics\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> Greats,\" which added existing games to the service. The additions indicated a change in strategy for ‌Apple Arcade‌, which was until then reliant on exclusive \"Arcade Originals\" only.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the significant news for Apple's mobile gaming subscription service, more than eight weeks have now passed with no new games being added to the platform. Even so, Apple is promoting a number of new games as \"coming soon,\" including the narrative-focused card game \"Solitaire Stories,\" fast-paced puzzler \"Frenzic Overtime,\" and turn-by-turn RPG \"Legends of Kingdom Rush.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting on Friday, June 4, ‌Apple Arcade‌ is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/killercow/status/1397255336004833281?s=20\">expected to resume</a> weekly additions to the service after this hiatus period.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Arcade‌‌ launched in September of 2019 as an ad-free mobile game subscription service with no in-app purchases. ‌‌Apple Arcade‌‌ is available across the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, and Mac for $4.99 per month, or as part of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a> bundle.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-arcade-no-new-games-in-two-months/\">Apple Arcade Hasn't Received Any New Games in Two Months</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-hasnt-received-any-new-games-in-two-months.2298907/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6fCFlDwBTzI:uNoe6bqCXw0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6fCFlDwBTzI:uNoe6bqCXw0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6fCFlDwBTzI\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c6bc0a50cb889985b658d82ba637f8eba1a1ee0a3b6e362475755eca8910694","category":"Apple"}
