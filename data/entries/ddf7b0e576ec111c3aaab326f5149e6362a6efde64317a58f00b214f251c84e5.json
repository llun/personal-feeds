(credit: Apple)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>When Apple announced the new iPad Pro, 24-inch iMac, and Apple TV 4K models during its April 20 livestreamed event, the company said those products would launch \"in the second half of May\" but didn't get more specific beyond that. Now, multiple apparent leaks—including one on Apple's website—have pointed to a more specific date: May 21.</p>\n<p>Prolific Apple news leaker Jon Prosser <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1386643873527697410?s=20\">named May 21</a> as the launch date for some of the products, and UK retailer John Lewis' product page for the new iPad Pro carried copy saying, \"Available 21 May 2021,\" as discovered by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/uk-retailer-john-lewis-ipad-pro-launch-may-21/\">MacRumors</a> and other Apple rumor sites.</p>\n<p>Adding further fuel to the fire, Apple today published a short post to its <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/all-new-imac-ipad-pro-and-apple-tv-4k-orders-start-tomorrow/\">Newsroom site</a>—essentially the public-facing company blog—reminding customers that they can pre-order these products starting tomorrow, April 30. That short post didn't say May 21—but some of the metadata on the post did. Apple has since removed the metadata referencing that date.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761213#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761213&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ddf7b0e576ec111c3aaab326f5149e6362a6efde64317a58f00b214f251c84e5","category":"Tech"}
