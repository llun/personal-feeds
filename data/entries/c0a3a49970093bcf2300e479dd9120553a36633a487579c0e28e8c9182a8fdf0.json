I expect my Markdown\neditor to show me every single keystroke I enter, which means any\nattempt to hide hyperlinks will be met with immediate rejection.\n(Sorry, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038\">Ulysses</a> and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127\">Craft</a>.) I do appreciate syntax coloring\nand styling where appropriate — so that bolded text is bolded,\nand headings are prominent… so long as the app doesn’t swallow the\nmarkup that makes them so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe I don’t know much about Markdown, but my understanding is that the whole point of it is to provide a syntax where the most common HTML tags for prose can be replaced by simple punctuation characters that are <em>meant</em> to be visible to the writer. I want to see the characters so I know I’ll get exactly the HTML output I think I’m going to get, but those punctuation characters shouldn’t distract from the readability of the prose. I created Markdown to use in <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a> without any syntax coloring at all, and to this day, I do most of my Markdown editing in <a href=\"https://redsweater.com/marsedit/\">MarsEdit</a>, which doesn’t color or style Markdown syntax at all. (It should though! Markdown is even better with some syntax coloring and styling.)</p>\n\n<p>I have no idea why there are now apps that use Markdown as their back end storage format but only show styled text without the Markdown source code visible. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/05/hey-world-goes-live\">Hey World</a>, for example, gets this right: they just do simple WYSIWYG editing where bold is bold, italic is italic, and links look like links and the linked URL is edited in a popup. If you want WYSIWYG, do WYSIWYG. If you want Markdown, show the Markdown. Trust me, it’s meant to be shown.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Jason Snell on iOS Markdown Editors’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/05/snell-ios-markdown-editors\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c0a3a49970093bcf2300e479dd9120553a36633a487579c0e28e8c9182a8fdf0","category":"Tech"}
