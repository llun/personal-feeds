In the past, that has meant <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/hd-emulation-mod-makes-mode-7-snes-games-look-like-new/\">upsampling rotated sprites in SNES' \"Mode 7\" games</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/widenes-emulation-expands-nes-scenes-past-the-usual-sd-screen-borders/\">adding \"widescreen\" support to NES games</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/better-than-reality-new-emulation-tech-lags-less-than-original-consoles/\">mitigating the controller lag</a> that was built into certain older consoles or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/blast-processing-in-2019-how-an-snes-emulator-solved-overclocking/\">overclocking an emulated SNES</a> to remove slowdown without ruining gameplay timing.</p>\n<p>The latest emulation-powered retro-gaming upgrade to cross our paths greatly simplifies an oft-overlooked capability built in to many Game Boy Advance titles. Namely, it adds the ability to play multiplayer titles in split screen on a single display.</p>\n<p>This upgrade is the work of <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/FPGAzumSpass\">Robert Peip</a>, a developer who's spent years working on <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/resources/overview.html\">field-programmable gate arrays</a> (FPGAs). These days, Peip works primarily on <a href=\"https://www.retrorgb.com/mister.html\">the MiSTer FPGA</a> an open source project that recreates classic gaming hardware extremely accurately through emulation \"cores\" that replicate every single logic gate involved in the schematics of the original system (most of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/super-nt-is-a-190-fpga-hdmi-snes-and-probably-other-acronyms/\">Analogue's high-end retro hardware</a> is similarly powered by FPGA cores). Such cores are <a href=\"https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/MiSTer\">currently available</a> for consoles ranging from the Odyssey 2 through the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/neo-geo/\">Neo Geo</a> era and more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774517#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774517&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d2b857a3680816ff13bb62d74ae86fef968f584f4271d169986e87cb689ec5bf","category":"Tech"}
