He’s known for his easy positive nature and seamlessly never-ending enthusiasm for bicycles. He opened <a href=\"https://www.greenlinecycles.com\">GreenLine Cycles</a> in 1992 while in his mid-20’s in Oroville, a foothill town just 20 minutes south of Chico. An impressive plunge to take for such a young person.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207951\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/25-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></p>\n<p>Before deciding to open a second location in Chico, Dax had the dream of creating a small US frame building business making downright functional and stylish do-all bikes. The concept was to design the frames in a manner that took a bit of the esoteric skill out of frame building. The main section of the frame would be 2 mirrored, CNC bent, continuous tubes. This, in theory, would allow you to throw a seat tube and head tube between them, weld on some dropouts and call it a bike. The intention was to be able to hire friends and folks in the community while still building affordable, and most importantly, US-made bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207938\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/40-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></p>\n<p>When sorting out the geometry, we wanted to maintain the soul of the original bike design. These bikes were never intended to be another reason to justify N+1, they were to be your daily driver/catch-all/do-all vehicle. With plenty of attachment points, tire clearance, fender capability, bag and rack, SS, and Coaster brake, it would literally allow you to turn it into virtually anything within reason. Now, our version decidedly left out the coaster brake compatibility and SS option because we knew it wasn’t ever going to become such a rig, and rather it would be mostly ridden as a rigid MTB or maybe a burly gravel rambler with slightly narrower tires.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207949\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?w=2048&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,2500&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,2250&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/28-scaled.jpg?resize=1638,2048&amp;quality=75 1638w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207950\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/27.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></p>\n<p>This design was driven by the necessity of a CNC tube bender to make the main frame, and yes, this would allow for a somewhat simple process to build frames in batches. But alas, I am not a computer-controlled device, nor would it have been reasonable to have someone CNC bend up a single one-off. So there I was, with my little manual Hossfeld tube bender, a notepad, and what I thought was about 4 times too much material. The amount of head-scratching and stressful nights ruining material in attempts to achieve a rather complex set of bends that all had to match up and appear as a seamless and contiguous tube&#8230; still makes my eye twitch.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207960\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/16.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207959\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/17.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></p>\n<p>Each side of the frame had 4 individually bent tubes that are joined via steel couplers that get pressed into each tube. The couplers are then secured by 3 rosette welds on each side and a seam weld. Using 4 different sections of tubing was a complete and total nightmare to pull off, however it had a pretty supreme benefit of being able to use different gauge tubes for each section to dial back the weight and help the ride quality a bit. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207963\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/13-1.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207961\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?w=2048&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,2500&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,2250&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/15-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1638,2048&amp;quality=75 1638w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /></p>\n<p>This project absolutely pushed my boundaries and forced me to get creative in order to execute a couple of the tight and compound bends around the BB and seat tube junction.
