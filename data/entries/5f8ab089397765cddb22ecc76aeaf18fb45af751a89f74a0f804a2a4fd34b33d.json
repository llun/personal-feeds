Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside><p>Back in 2017, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/tesla-might-have-real-competition-soon-meet-the-lucid-air/\">I got my first face-to-face encounter with a Lucid Air</a>, when the startup electric vehicle-maker brought one of its early prototypes to Washington, DC. Its EV combined distinctive styling with some innovative packaging, with the technical team being led by a CTO who can count being the Tesla Model S' chief engineer among his CV highlights.</p>\n<p>Lucid's timeline might have slipped a little from the original plan—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/the-automotive-industry-has-got-spac-madness-and-it-may-not-end-well/\">investors are much less reticent about putting their money into EV startups</a> than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/the-electric-lucid-air-hit-235mph-in-testing-but-will-it-see-production/\">they were in 2017</a>, and then the pandemic happened—but it's on track to begin deliveries of the Air later this year. And on Sunday, I was fortunate enough to go for a ride in one of the company's current prototypes to see how things have changed.</p>\n<p>From the outside, the Air looks like little else on the market. It's a smooth shape, with a relatively long hood and a short trunk, accented by the polished aluminum pillars that frame the glasshouse. Superficially it looks much the same as when I first saw it, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/please-dont-describe-us-as-a-tesla-killer-ars-talks-to-lucid-motors/\">but many of the details have changed along</a> the way to what may well be a class-leading <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/this-will-be-the-most-aerodynamically-efficient-electric-car-in-production/\">drag coefficient of just 0.21</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768044#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768044&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
