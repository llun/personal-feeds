Apple in a statement said that the change is a continuation of its commitment to diversity and inclusion.<blockquote>We're excited to introduce two new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voices for English speakers and the option for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; users to select the voice they want when they set up their device. This is a continuation of Apple's long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.</blockquote>The new voices that have been added use source talent recordings run through Apple's Neural Engine to make the voices \"flow more organically\" through phrases generated on the fly.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter upgrading to iOS 14.5, the \"&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; & Search\" portion of the Settings app has an upgraded \"&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Voice\" option. The \"Accent\" label has been changed to \"Variety,\" and there's no longer a \"Gender\" selection. Instead, there are now four \"American\" voice options to choose from. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nToday's beta also improves &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; voices in Ireland, Russia, and Italy to add Apple's Neural text to speech, which brings the total number of devices using this technology to 38. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; now handles 25 billion requests on over 500M voices and supports 21 languages in 36 countries.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/ios-14-5-new-siri-voices/\">iOS 14.5 Adds New Siri Voices, No Longer Defaults to Female</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-14-5-adds-new-siri-voices-no-longer-defaults-to-female.2290225/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KvfHHtHD9fg:aCtozcW2aFQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KvfHHtHD9fg:aCtozcW2aFQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KvfHHtHD9fg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6084c5fba540063d3b50d72c0912c1557a52ee10406c222c7ed868240ad11536","category":"Apple"}
