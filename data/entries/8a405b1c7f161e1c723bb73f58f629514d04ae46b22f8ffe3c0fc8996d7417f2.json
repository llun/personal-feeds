Last week, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick doubled down on that decision, saying the market was ready for an increase in gaming's de facto price ceiling.</p>\n<p>\"We announced a $70 price point for <em>NBA 2K21</em>, our view was that we’re offering an array of extraordinary experiences, lots of replayability, and the last time there was a frontline price increase in the US was 2005, 2006, so we think consumers were ready for it,” Zelnick said at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference (as <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rockstar-owner-argues-players-are-ready-for-70-games/\">transcribed by Video Games Chronicle</a>).</p>\n<p>That's not all that surprising, considering the source of the quote. But we shouldn't have to take his word for it. Four months have passed since <em>NBA 2K21</em> launched on new consoles, and six months have passed since it launched at a lower $60 price point on the PS4 and Xbox One. That should be enough time to determine whether players at large were willing to spend extra money on a big-name \"next-gen\" experience and whether Take-Two's pricing experiment is worth repeating, right?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747993#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747993&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a405b1c7f161e1c723bb73f58f629514d04ae46b22f8ffe3c0fc8996d7417f2","category":"Tech"}
