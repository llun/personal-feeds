The new \"Pro\" models are likely to feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">upgraded Ultra Wide camera lens </a>with a wider f/1.8 aperture, a six-element lens, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/kuo-iphone-13-ultra-wide-autofocus/\">autofocus</a>, with some rumors suggesting that the Ultra Wide upgrade could come to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/iphone-13-upgraded-ultra-wide-lens-rumor/\">all four iPhone 13 models</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iphone-13-duan-rui1.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSensor-shift stabilization is expected to be expanded <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/27/sensor-shift-stabilization-all-iphone-13-models/\">across the entire iPhone lineup</a>, introducing improvements in low light performance and stabilization by reducing camera shake, with the feature rumored to be available for the Wide lens and the Ultra Wide lens of the Pro models. One rumor claims the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models will also be able to take Portrait Mode videos.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, there are also claims that the ‌iPhone 13‌ models will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">astrophotography camera capabilities</a> for capturing the sky. This could involve a special mode that activates when the ‌iPhone‌ is pointed at the sky, allowing the device to detect the moon, stars, and other artifacts and adjust exposure. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iphone-13-duan-rui3.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the rumors are accurate, all of these improvements are likely to require a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/iphone-13-thinner-notch/\">slightly larger camera bump</a>, although individual lenses may protrude less from the device's body, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/iphone-13-matt-black-stainless-steel-coating/\">one source</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup will be unveiled in the fall of 2021, with the company aiming to return to its traditional September launch timeframe following last year's later-than-usual <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> launch.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duanrui/\">DuanRui</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/29/iphone-13-dual-lens-diagonal-array/\">Latest iPhone 13 Dummies Again Show New Diagonal Dual-Lens Camera Arrangement Coming to Standard Model</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-iphone-13-dummies-again-show-new-diagonal-dual-lens-camera-arrangement-coming-to-standard-model.2302667/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oBnWP6FwQUU:bUh-XqYHSsk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oBnWP6FwQUU:bUh-XqYHSsk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oBnWP6FwQUU\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c61b58812efa6f4b269e4e701eed1a33792aa07fb3c44b26c0dc0bc0c351393e","category":"Apple"}
