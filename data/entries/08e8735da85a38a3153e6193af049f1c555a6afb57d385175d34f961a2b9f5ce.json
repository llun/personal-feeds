Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are now in version 11.0, and while the changes aren't dramatic, there are some small quality-of-life tweaks here.</p>\n<p>On iOS, most of the listed updates apply to every app in the suite. They include onscreen keypads for entering numerical values in places where that wasn't as easy to do before, the ability to make edit mode the default viewing mode for every document you open, new editing controls in the Arrange Inspector, a new gesture for adding or removing objects, and the ability to include phone number links.</p>\n<p>Numbers has one minor, app-specific change: you can now exclude the summary worksheet when you export your spreadsheet to Excel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751724#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751724&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"08e8735da85a38a3153e6193af049f1c555a6afb57d385175d34f961a2b9f5ce","category":"Tech"}
