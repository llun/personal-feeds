The FDA has been looking over data on Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine since February 4, when the company applied for Emergency Use Authorization. The agency’s green light is a positive sign ahead of this Friday, February 26, when the FDA will convene an advisory committee to make a recommendation on whether the FDA should grant the EUA.

The other two vaccines are both two-dose, mRNA-based vaccines, one made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech and the other from Moderna, which developed its vaccine in collaboration with researchers at the US National Institutes of Health.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744836#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744836&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e31f589a58f5b7821457e1a817332f683fc189fc4d761fb1bbb93792371571a","category":"Tech"}
