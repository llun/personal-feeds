SpaceX has been telling users to expect speeds of 50Mbps to 150Mbps since the beta <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/spacex-starlink-public-beta-begins-its-99-a-month-plus-500-up-front/\">began a few months ago</a>.</p>\n<p>Musk also wrote that \"latency will drop to ~20ms later this year.\" This is no surprise, as SpaceX promised latency of 20ms to 40ms during the beta and had said months ago that \"we expect to achieve 16ms to 19ms by summer 2021.\"</p>\n<p>It sounds like the speed and latency improvements will roll out around the same time as when Starlink switches from beta to more widespread availability. Two weeks ago, Starlink <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/spacex-starlink-now-taking-pre-orders-for-service-in-mid-to-late-2021/\">opened preorders</a> for service expected to be available in the second half of 2021, albeit with limited availability in each region.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744455#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744455&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"989d2639ddaaa08ed502047961d00a3ad490c44aca148da42c13d90043ddaaa9","category":"Tech"}
