One third of the matter in your brain is literally made of omega-3, and many people eat fish and take fish oil as an omega-3 supplement. But the source of omega-3 is algae — not fish. Fish get their omegas from eating algae. Simris Algae Omega-3 is a completely plant-based and superior alternative to fish oil and krill, without the mercury, PCB, and dioxins, and without harming our oceans.</p>\n\n<p>Simris is a Swedish pioneer company growing microalgae. They save and protect endangered marine habitats by replacing unsustainable marine ingredients, and proudly combine Scandinavian innovation and design at its finest.</p>\n\n<p>Everything about Simris’s products is just really nice: from their website to their packaging to the actual capsules. Just take a look at how nice their ad looks here on the DF sidebar. Great design through and through.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/20/simris\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f6d861597881d396f2811c757de54fff8a9a09a57cda7a79faa8f4006ee8827a","category":"Tech"}
