From the UK’s Sturdy Cycles to Australia’s Prova Cycles and the US’ Firefly, each of these brands uses 3D printing technologies to make their bikes stronger, lighter weight, and more modern. Silca recently launched their <a href=\"https://silca.cc/pages/mensola-computer-mounts\" target=\"_blank\">Mensola Computer Mount</a>, which retails at $175, and bolts directly to your stem’s faceplate. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/w1200_a950_Mensola-22-Isometric-View.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Due to the 3D modeling and fabrication technologies, they could produce a number of designs by simply 3D modeling and printing them. This is the future of componentry design and yeah, it’s expensive, but it’s mostly just cool that it exists. </p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a1e6e5e203324b081684628acdf4aa8594f0678e13ba5598700c323a8f4fa718","category":"Cycling"}
