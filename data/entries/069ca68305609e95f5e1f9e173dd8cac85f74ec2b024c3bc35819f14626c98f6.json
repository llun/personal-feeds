NASA's multibillion-dollar Mars rover will arrive at the red planet and almost immediately begin the process of trying to set down safely on the surface.</p>\n<p>This is easier said than done. On approach to Mars, the Perseverance rover will shed its cruise stage, retaining only an aeroshell to protect itself and a descent stage. This slimmed-down spacecraft will hit the atmosphere traveling at about 20,000km/hour and have just 410 seconds—or nearly seven minutes—to shed this velocity and make a feathery touchdown.</p>\n<h2>How to land on Mars</h2>\n<p>Though the Martian atmosphere is thin, it will nonetheless provide a majority of the resistance to slow Perseverance down. Within about 80 seconds of entering the Martian atmosphere, temperatures outside the aeroshell are expected to reach 1300° Celsius.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741883#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741883&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"069ca68305609e95f5e1f9e173dd8cac85f74ec2b024c3bc35819f14626c98f6","category":"Tech"}
