Back in 2017, the Danish toymaker brought out a highly detailed Saturn V—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/yes-that-lego-saturn-v-set-is-everything-you-hope-its-going-to-be/\">a model ably assembled in time lapse by Ars' Eric Berger before its release</a>. Two years later, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/recreate-your-own-apollo-11-moon-landing-with-a-new-lego-set/\">Lego followed up with the Apollo 11 lunar lander</a>, and in 2020 it was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/clear-your-calendar-and-desk-legos-iss-inspired-set-arrives-on-february-1/\">the turn of the International Space Station</a>. And earlier this April, Lego released the latest set to bear NASA's famous worm logo: <a href=\"https://fave.co/2QadOf8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">space shuttle <em>Discovery</em></a>, as it was for 1990's STS-31 mission. This was an important mission, reaching the highest orbit for a space shuttle to date. <em>Discovery</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/the-hubble-space-telescope-launched-30-years-ago-then-the-problems-began/\">put the Hubble space telescope into orbit</a>, and its crew even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/07/30-years-of-manned-space-flight-the-last-flight-of-the-space-shuttle/3/\">captured the event on IMAX cameras</a> brought along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Lego has made a number of space shuttle sets over the years, but none has been as detailed as this 2,354-piece set. The finished orbiter is a substantial 21.8 inches (55.46 cm) long with a 13.6-inch (34.6 cm) wingspan, and it lends itself well to reproduction in Lego bricks at this scale; the space shuttle was covered in blocky tiles, after all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755772#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755772&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
