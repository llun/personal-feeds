The company revealed its new EV strategy on Thursday morning, laying out a roadmap that it says will result in class-leading EVs in every segment, from small city cars to body-on-frame pickup trucks and commercial vans.</p>\n<p>\"The customer is always at the heart of Stellantis, and our commitment with this €30 billion [$35.5 billion] plus investment plan is to offer iconic vehicles that have the performance, capability, style, comfort and electric range that fit seamlessly into their daily lives,\" said Carlos Tavares, Stellantis' chief executive officer. \"The strategy we laid out today focuses the right amount of investment on the right technology to reach the market at the right time, ensuring that Stellantis powers the freedom of movement in the most efficient, affordable and sustainable way.\"</p>\n<p>The STLA Small platform will be for city cars with a range of up to 300 miles (500 km), and we're unlikely to see many of them here in the US, barring some fundamental shift in North American attitudes toward small, slow, cheap cars.
