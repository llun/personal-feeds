Gold is available for &#36;1,174.92 and Space Gray is available for &#36;1,179.00. The lowest price we've ever seen on this model was around &#36;1,149 late last year, but we've yet to see a return to that amount in 2021.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;76 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (512GB) for &#36;1,172.92</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple updated the MacBook Air in November 2020 with its new M1 chip, which is the first Apple-designed Arm-based chip.
