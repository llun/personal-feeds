The bacteria, <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em>, usually infects by direct contact with an environmental source, i.e. contaminated soil or water. It most often attacks through breaks in the skin and it very rarely jumps from human to human. Yet genetic analyses of the bacterial strains in the latest US cases indicate that the three, geographically-separated infections are related.</p>\n<p>The curious cluster of cases suggests there was a common source of the bacteria. Investigators speculate that a yet-unidentified imported product or animal could be a common source. For instance, iguanas and monkeys imported with infections have been linked to cases in the past. But the cluster also resurfaces concern that <em>B. pseudomallei</em> is no longer a mere interloper in the US, rather it may have become a permanent, low-key resident.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777964#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777964&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab06436a99f9afdd615f97e878e37cc19dd53caa70f2ecda232086baa7dd9c26","category":"Tech"}
