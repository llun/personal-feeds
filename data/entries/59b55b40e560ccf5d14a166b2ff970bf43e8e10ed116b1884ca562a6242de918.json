When running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> apps on ‌M1‌ Macs, there's a Touch Alternatives preference pane that allows users to set keyboard commands for touch input alternatives, plus iPadOS apps launch with a larger window if the Mac's display allows it. Touch Alternatives let you customize taps, swipes, and drags.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has added a \"Controller Emulation\" feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/macos-big-sur-11-3-controller-emulation-m1/\">that can be enabled </a>for ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ apps to map game controller buttons to keyboard keys and mouse buttons.
