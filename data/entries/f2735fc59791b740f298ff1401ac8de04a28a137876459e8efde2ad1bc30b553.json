They also claimed that the \"M1X\" chip is being reserved for high-end \"Pro\" Macs, which could include the MacBook Pro and a larger, more powerful <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> model. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Just wanted to share some details on when to expect the next generation ‌M2‌ (not the M1X which is reserved for the Pro Mac devices). This processor is on track to release in the first half of 2022 alongside the upcoming colorful Macbook (Air).</p>— Dylan (@dylandkt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1412089676220055555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 5, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDylandkt's claim is not entirely new, given that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> has previously said that the next-generation ‌MacBook Air‌ will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/11/images-reveal-colorful-new-macbook-air-design/\">complete redesign</a>, a range of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/prosser-macbook-air-colors-similar-to-imac/\">iMac-like color options</a>, and an ‌M2‌ chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDylandkt has been resolute in previous comments about the \"M1X\" being destined for the next-generation MacBook Pro, while the \"‌M2‌\" will apparently be a lower-end chip for the ‌MacBook Air‌, but it is worth noting that this <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/21/shaky-rumor-claims-macbook-pro-will-feature-m1x/\">does not seem to fit very well</a> with the specific thoughts of reliable <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman about Apple's upcoming custom silicon chips for the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, Dylandkt has correctly predicted details about a number of Apple's recent product launches. As early as November 2020, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1326956166790909954?s=20\">Dylandkt claimed</a> that the next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> would feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip. This was five months before the device emerged. Before the launch of the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ earlier this year, Dylandkt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1383453651285381122?s=20\">correctly predicted</a> that the new, redesigned ‌iMac‌ would replace the smaller entry-level ‌iMac‌ only and feature an ‌M1‌ chip rather than an M1X. Dylandkt's claim about the ‌MacBook Air‌ with the ‌M2‌ chip may therefore be more believable.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dylandkt/\">dylandkt</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/m2-macbook-air-to-arrive-in-2022/\">M2 Chip Rumored to Arrive in 2022 With Redesigned MacBook Air</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-chip-rumored-to-arrive-in-2022-with-redesigned-macbook-air.2303408/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TY9oDdZIiOs:GyJj7uc8imk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TY9oDdZIiOs:GyJj7uc8imk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/TY9oDdZIiOs\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f2735fc59791b740f298ff1401ac8de04a28a137876459e8efde2ad1bc30b553","category":"Apple"}
