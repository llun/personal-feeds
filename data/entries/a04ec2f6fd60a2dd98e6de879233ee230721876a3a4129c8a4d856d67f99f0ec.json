The move came in response to a lawsuit filed Monday against Snap and the two messaging apps.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/507515040/Snap-Lawsuit#from_embed\">lawsuit</a> seeks class-action status to represent all 92 million Snapchat users, and it demands that Snap ban both Yolo and LMK from its app store. The developers of both apps, the suit alleges, did not implement adequate safeguards against harassing and bullying behavior.</p>\n<p>The suit was brought by Kristin Bride, the mother of Carson Bride, a 16-year-old who suffered from cyberbullying on the Yolo and LMK apps. Over half the messages he received on Yolo were “meant to humiliate him, often involving sexually explicit and disturbing content,” according to the lawsuit. After a particularly personal string of insults, 16-year-old Carson searched in vain for how to reveal the identity of his bullies. Just over two weeks later, he took his own life. His last search was “reveal Yolo username online.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764515#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764515&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a04ec2f6fd60a2dd98e6de879233ee230721876a3a4129c8a4d856d67f99f0ec","category":"Tech"}
