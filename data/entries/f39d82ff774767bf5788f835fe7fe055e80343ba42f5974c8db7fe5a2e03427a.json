Cosmic radiation and fluctuations in power or temperature are the most common naturally occurring causes. <a href=\"http://lambda-diode.com/opinion/ecc-memory\">Research from 2010</a> estimated that a computer with 4GB of commodity RAM has a 96 percent chance of experiencing a bit flip within three days.</p>\n<p>An independent researcher recently demonstrated how bitflips can come back to bite Windows users when their PCs reach out to Microsoft’s windows.com domain. Windows devices do this regularly to do things like making sure the time shown in the computer clock is accurate, connecting to Microsoft’s cloud-based services, and recovering from crashes.</p>\n<p>Remy, as the researcher asked to be referred to, mapped the 32 valid domain names that were one bitflip away from windows.com. He provided the following to help readers understand how these flips can cause the domain to change to whndows.com:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747156#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747156&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f39d82ff774767bf5788f835fe7fe055e80343ba42f5974c8db7fe5a2e03427a","category":"Tech"}
