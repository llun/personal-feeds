That means that they’re made in Italy, and feature Sidi’s proprietary symmetrical Tecno-4 fastening mechanism, along with a super tech-y velcro strap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sole is constructed of carbon fibre, finished in a 3k weave “oriented at opposing angles that maximize stiffness while allowing for a small degree of controlled flex in the toe area,” which is something of a departure from the propensity of rival manufacturers to dial up the stiffness of their shoes like a Spinal Tap amp (only, it now goes up to 15). Weight is around 260 g per piece in a size 42.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the pads on the soles are replaceable, which is a promising sign for a long lifespan. And given they’re unlikely to be a screaming bargain, you&#8217;d certainly hope to get a few years out of them. While details of availability and pricing are light-on at the moment, the standard Sixtys come in at around €350 (~US$420 / AU$540). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more, head over to <a href=\"https://www.sidi.com/en/content/29-limited-edition-sixty-multicolor\">Sidi.com.</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/sidis-limited-edition-sixty-road-shoes-are-a-riot-of-colour/\">Sidi’s limited edition Sixty road shoes are a riot of colour</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4d83bfa8b66cf206bab19f45a94c074ca26336ff9d415f831b361e7750f42352","category":"Cycling"}
