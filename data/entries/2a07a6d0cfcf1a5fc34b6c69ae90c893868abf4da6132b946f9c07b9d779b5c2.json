According to a report by <em><a href=\"http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11865\">The Elec</a></em>, the company is set to launch a Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 2 at a July event. Samsung has previously suggested it may skip releasing a new Galaxy Note device this year due to the fallout from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/samsung-skipping-note-chip-shortage/\">global semiconductor shortage</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Samsung's laptops are overdue an update, and according to reliable leaker <a href=\"https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-and-pro-360-first-looks-1616239064-47310169\">Evan Blass</a>, it could launch 11th-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/02/intel-announces-tiger-lake-chips/\">Intel Tiger Lake</a> laptops under the Galaxy Book Pro line. The Intel chips include integrated Xe graphics, Thunderbolt 4, USB 4, PCIe Gen 4, and WiFi 6 support.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors and <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-live-images-safety-korea/\">recently unearthed Korean certifications</a> also point to new Galaxy Book Pro and Galaxy Book Pro 360 models running Microsoft Windows. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe notebooks are expected to sport nearly bezel-less 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch OLED displays, while the latter model is expected to feature a 360-degree hinge, as per the name, and possibly 5G connectivity.
