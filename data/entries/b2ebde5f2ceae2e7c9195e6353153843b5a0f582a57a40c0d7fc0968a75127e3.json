The flight, which crested at an altitude of 89.2 km, was piloted by CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.</p>\n<p>\"We will immediately begin processing the data gained from this successful test flight, and we look forward to sharing news on our next planned milestone,\" said Michael Colglazier, chief executive officer of Virgin Galactic, after the mission.</p>\n<p>The flight was significant for Virgin Galactic, as the last time VSS <em>Unity</em> successfully carried out a powered spaceflight came in February 2019. Since that time the company has undertaken a lot of work to prepare for commercial flights on its suborbital space plane. This includes moving its flight operations to New Mexico and at least beginning to upgrade the interior of its cabin for tourist flights. Although Virgin Galactic has not released photos of the spacecraft's interior, some changes can be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AstroPawankumar/status/1396406959495008256\">seen here</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767069#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767069&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2ebde5f2ceae2e7c9195e6353153843b5a0f582a57a40c0d7fc0968a75127e3","category":"Tech"}
