Using the API, the NHS app checks a database to look for a match, and can inform the user if they need to self-quarantine and/or get tested if someone at the same location recorded a positive COVID-19 test result that was flagged by other means.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe U.K.'s National Health Service in England and Wales had planned to release an update to its app that would have asked COVID-19 positive users to upload a log of their QR code check-ins. However, according to the terms and conditions which govern Apple and Google's contact tracing API, any app that uses the API cannot collect user location data. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result, both companies have refused to make the update available for download on their respective app distribution platforms. The previous version of the NHS app, however, remains available for download.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBut the two firms had explicitly banned such a function from the start.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUnder the terms that all health authorities signed up to use Apple and Google's privacy-centric contact-tracing tech, they had to agree not to collect any location data via the software.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result, Apple and Google refused to make the update available for download from their app stores last week and have instead kept the old version live.</blockquote>As the <em>BBC</em> notes, the NHS app has always included the ability for users to scan a QR code when visiting a public establishment. However, code was only used to check a database that had been generated by other means by local authorities following a viral outbreak. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe now rejected update would have changed that, by asking users who had tested positive to upload their QR code checks-in to the cloud. A spokesperson for the Department of Health told the <em>BBC</em> that \"The deployment of the functionality of the NHS Covid-19 app to enable users to upload their venue history has been delayed.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/exposure-notification-guide/\">Exposure Notification Guide</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-blocks-nhs-update-due-to-rule-breaking/\">Apple Blocks Update to UK NHS Contact Tracing App for Breaking Location Data Collection Rules</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blocks-update-to-uk-nhs-contact-tracing-app-for-breaking-location-data-collection-rules.2291425/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Cc959u0t-kM:AUh13-JhCMA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Cc959u0t-kM:AUh13-JhCMA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Cc959u0t-kM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"242c9c54bb8abc6720c341915640ed744c481de0dac4e179353edceb1d1be52d","category":"Apple"}
