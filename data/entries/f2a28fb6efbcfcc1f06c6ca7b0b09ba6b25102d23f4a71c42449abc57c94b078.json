If an image is chosen to self-destruct, the receiver will have a one-time chance to view it and not be able to save or export the image to their device.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WhatsApp is working on self-destructing photos in a future update for iOS and Android.<br>• Self-destructing photos cannot be exported from WhatsApp.<br>• WhatsApp didn&#39;t implement a screenshot detection for self-destructing photos yet.<br><br>Same concept from Instagram Direct. &#x23f1; <a href=\"https://t.co/LLsezVL2Hj\">pic.twitter.com/LLsezVL2Hj</a></p>&mdash; WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1366928097451327490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWABetaInfo says that WhatsApp has not implemented screenshot detection, which would alert the sender if a screenshot of the self-destructing photo was taken. WhatsApp's approach to the feature is similar to Instagram Direct stories, in which case an image or video is only viewable once before it expires. Other popular messaging apps such as Telegram have already included self-destructing images for some time.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/whatsapp-self-destructing-images-ios/\">WhatsApp Testing Self-Destructing Images for iOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-testing-self-destructing-images-for-ios.2286913/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=k5L_UE5urpY:TID1Q6SZX58:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=k5L_UE5urpY:TID1Q6SZX58:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/k5L_UE5urpY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f2a28fb6efbcfcc1f06c6ca7b0b09ba6b25102d23f4a71c42449abc57c94b078","category":"Apple"}
