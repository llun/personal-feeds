It also found no evidence that the lender's credit decisions had a disproportionate impact on certain groups of people.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; came under fire for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/10/apple-card-gender-discrimination/\">alleged gender discrimination</a> in the months after its launch, with some customers complaining on Twitter that women were granted lower credit limits than men.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis triggered an investigation into &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s algorithms for determining credit limits in November 2019. The investigation, which included an analysis of the underwriting data for almost 400,000 New York applicants for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, found no violations of fair lending laws. In a statement, Superintendent of Financial Services Linda A. Lacewell said:\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>While we found no fair lending violations, our inquiry stands as a reminder of disparities in access to credit that continue nearly 50 years after the passage of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. This is one part of a broader discussion we must have about equal credit access.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNevertheless, Goldman Sachs was criticized for shortcomings in customer service and a perceived lack of transparency that undermined consumer trust, with the report saying that these problems \"might have been prevented by better management\" of &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s rollout.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-card-cleared-of-gender-bias/\">Investigation Clears Goldman Sachs of Apple Card Gender Bias</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/investigation-clears-goldman-sachs-of-apple-card-gender-bias.2289340/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EU3pppotUMs:gpk2FyeBlxA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EU3pppotUMs:gpk2FyeBlxA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/EU3pppotUMs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fffb492412dd59a02d6ef5878afa25447266377b2cd6ce4110c3fdd778ec402","category":"Apple"}
