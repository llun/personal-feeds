Gmail, in fact, went so long <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/\">without updating</a> that it started giving users a warning that it was out of date, but no update was available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle Maps was updated with App Privacy labels in early April, and alongside Google Photos, it was one of the last apps to get the data collection details.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNow that Google Maps is compliant with the App Store rules, Google is once again able to update it. Today's version 5.65 refresh is minor in scale, offering bug fixes that improve the Google Maps app, but Google is now free to add additional features going forward.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/google-maps-updated-four-months/\">Google Maps App for iOS Finally Updated After Four Months</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-app-for-ios-finally-updated-after-four-months.2291457/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dXFz5nGXjVo:BjPAxtFrKbc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dXFz5nGXjVo:BjPAxtFrKbc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dXFz5nGXjVo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"631785bfc09eb173a34f3f1ec59ca171cf6d74fc67fe3b169023a66af72cdcb8","category":"Apple"}
