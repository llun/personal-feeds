Roval has now updated the wheelset with the new Rapide C38, and bringing that performance advantage to even more people seems to be the objective. The new wheels are remarkably similar to the outgoing version with the same tried and tested rim, but Roval has dropped the price of the wheelset by a cool US$200 to an even US$1,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new disc-only Rapide C38 wheels retain the same full carbon rim, which features a 38 mm height, 21 mm internal width, 26.6 mm external width, and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/09/specialized-and-roval-have-stopped-investing-in-tubulars-heres-why/\" target=\"_blank\">unlike Roval’s newer road wheels</a>, these are still officially tubeless compatible. Roval says this rim is optimised for wider tyres and claims it aerodynamically outperforms many deeper rims while providing better handling and sidewall support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Swiss 370 centre-lock hubs, including the 18-tooth <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/dt-swiss-announces-star-ratchet-ln-upgrade-kit-for-lower-end-hubs-and-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Ratchet LN system</a>, are laced to 24 J-bend spokes both front and rear with external nipples. In fact, that change from the previous DT Swiss 350-based hubs is the only noticeable change from the outgoing C38s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in, the new wheelset tips the scales at 1,600 g (claimed) including tubeless rim tape, a mere 40 g increase on the older, and more expensive, C38s. Thanks to this low weight, internal width and disc brake setup, Roval says the new wheels are equally at home on dirt roads or alpine passes, claiming the Rapide C38s are “out of place nowhere, at home everywhere.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the outgoing C38 wheels, the new Rapide C38 is available in disc brake only and also features Roval’s lifetime warranty and no-fault crash replacement policy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roval Rapide C38 wheelset is available now priced at US$1,000 (international pricing TBC).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roval-Rapide-C38-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The Rapide C38 is said to be the training wheel of choice for professionals and an affordable performance upgrade for any rider.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roval-Rapide-C38-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The new hubs feature DT Swiss’ Ratchet LN system.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roval-Rapide-C38-4-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The 38 mm-tall rim remains and unlike the CLX Rapides, the 38s are tubeless ready. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roval-Rapide-C38-7-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The new Rapide C38 are said to be at home on dirt roads and high mountain roads.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/roval-unveils-new-cheaper-and-still-tubeless-rapide-c38-wheelset/\">Roval unveils new, cheaper, and still tubeless Rapide C38 wheelset</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4753a263217f32ab5b090f3f7efedb19282eb3dfde71a1f3a659f9d3871dca7b","category":"Cycling"}
