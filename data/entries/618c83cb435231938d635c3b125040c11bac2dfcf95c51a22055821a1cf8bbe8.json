Now, a judge in California has ruled that Apple needs to face the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. District&nbsp;Judge Edward&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Davila for the Northern District of California decided Monday that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.326502/gov.uscourts.cand.326502.306.2.pdf&amp;xcust=1-1-340288-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.326502/gov.uscourts.cand.326502.306.2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a growing class-action suit spanning eight states can proceed</a> despite Apple&rsquo;s objections. The suit, which claims that &ldquo;the low-travel design of the butterfly mechanism makes the keys prone to fail when minute amounts of dust or debris enter the sensitive area beneath the switch,&rdquo; includes 11 consumers from California, Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, Florida, Washington, New Jersey, and Michigan, and seeks unspecified &ldquo;economic injury and aggregate damages.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The suit relies on &ldquo;a choice-based conjoint analysis&rdquo; to determine &ldquo;the price at which a consumer would choose a laptop with a keyboard defect over laptops with no defects&rdquo; and effectively measure &ldquo;the discount a customer would demand before purchasing a MacBook with a disclosed keyboard defect.&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s butterfly keyboard has been known to suffer from stuck, repeating, and unresponsive keys. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems like a stretch to say that Apple knowingly charged full price for a laptop that it knew was defective, but the judge found enough the argument &ldquo;relevant to Plaintiffs&rsquo; theory of class-wide damages&rdquo; and certified the class-action suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Girard Sharp, the law firm behind the suit, is looking to expand its class-action to more consumers in all 50 states <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.girardsharp.com/work-pending-macbook&amp;xcust=1-1-340288-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.girardsharp.com/work-pending-macbook\" rel=\"nofollow\">through an online survey</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple already admitted the problems with the butterfly keyboard by way of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231540/apple-introduces-keyboard-service-program-for-mac-laptops-with-butterfly-keyboards.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231540/apple-introduces-keyboard-service-program-for-mac-laptops-with-butterfly-keyboards.html\">Keyboard Service Program</a> that covers all laptops using the keyboard. After several &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; that failed to alleviate the problems, Apple switched to a scissor-based Magic Keyboard with the launch of the 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2019 and has since switched all of its notebooks over to the newer style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is no stranger to class-action lawsuits. Most notably, it was forced to pay up to $500 million to consumers over battery-related throttling in the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE. If the class-action is successful, it will likely consist of direct payments to affected customers and refunds for any keyboard repairs made that aren&rsquo;t already covered by the Keyboard Service Program. </p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"If you bought a MacBook with a butterfly keyboard, Apple may soon owe you money","siteHash":"18b3988459c0fdfe4b1befa47666fd1c54d81cd627ff2a4bcee67319ec9cd145","entryHash":"618c83cb435231938d635c3b125040c11bac2dfcf95c51a22055821a1cf8bbe8","category":"Apple"}
