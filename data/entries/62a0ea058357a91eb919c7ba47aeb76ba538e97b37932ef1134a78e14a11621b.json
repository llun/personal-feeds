After 32 years, the internet finally agreed upon something: that this year’s crop of <a href=\"/in-depth/2055/the-best-mens-worldtour-team-kits-for-2021\">team jerseys in the men’s WorldTour</a> is quite poor.</p>\n<p>A smorgasbord of corporate blues, blacks and reds that mush into one once the mind begins to lose concentration, I’m glad to see that the majority of you agreed with me when I claimed this year’s collection of kits were about as inspiring as a current-day party political announcement.</p>\n<p>Praise be to <a href=\"/tags/ag2r-la-mondiale\">AG2R-Citroen</a>, the only team willing to think outside of the box rather than presenting what is a jersey that would look in better company at a city bank’s annual charity bike ride than on the slopes of the Koppenberg or Mont Ventoux.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the cycling jersey has been and always will be the ultimate advertising canvas for the weird and wonderful sponsors that have graced our sport. But now, we can all agree that everything just feels a bit bland.</p>\n<p>What’s more, our agreement is almost unanimous that cycling jerseys, and full kits for that matter, were infinitely better ‘back in the day’ from a period in which the common belief was that bolder was better.</p>\n<p>This all got us thinking, if we could take one of those jerseys from the past and slap it straight into the current peloton, which one would we choose and, even more so, what would the public opt for? So we asked you via our social media platforms and the results were fascinating.</p>\n<h3>The good, the great and the reminiscently ugly</h3>\n<p>Across the board, three particular team jerseys proved most popular among our readership: La Vie Claire, Mapei and Brooklyn. No surprise really considering each from this trio is as iconic as the Grand Tours and Monuments won while wearing them.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43407\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/02/pressesports_526454_cycle_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Mapei’s technicolour dreamcoat approach was always on the right side of garish. The combination of colourful cubes and world flags was an alluring pull throughout cycling’s ‘wild west’ era in the 1990s. Still to this day, seeing a sack of Mapei cement mix at the local B&amp;Q is enough to have the heart skip a beat.</p>\n<p>And Brooklyn, the iconic livery of ‘the gipsy’, Roger de Vlaeminck, a man whose mercurial talents were such that his competitors swore he didn’t ride over the cobbles to four <a href=\"/tags/paris-roubaix\">Paris-Roubaix</a> titles, he glided over them. The inverted American flag is a jersey we hold so dearly. The perfect combination of design and colour worn by one of the greats.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43406\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/02/ofs_vlaeminck-maertens_19-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>But by far, the most popular pick was La Vie Claire. The abstract modernist art of early 20th-century Dutch artist Piet Mondrian designed by clothing house Benetton into a jersey to promote a chain of French health food shops.</p>\n<p>Consistently considered to be the greatest cycling jersey of all time, many times voted as such in various polls, worn by amateurs all over the world with even my good self having owned a long-sleeve version from Prendas previously. It's a jersey that it seems most of us would welcome back into today’s peloton with arms wide open.</p>\n<p>Also, it wasn't just the obvious ones that repeated themselves, our readers clearly have some acquired tastes.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/8957/adidas-releases-first-set-of-road-cycling-shoes-in-15-years\">Adidas releases first set of road cycling shoes in 15 years</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/5935/gallery-colnago-master-x-light-x-adidas\">Gallery: Colnago Master X-Light x Adidas </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/7774/how-to-watch-the-opening-classics-weekend\">How to watch the opening Classics weekend: Live TV and streaming</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nForgotten gems included Sean Kelly’s Skil-Shimano of the mid-1980s, the QPR hoops of Atala-Campagnolo, the red, gold and green of Team Polti, the workman overalls of Castorama and the monochrome look of Carpano. One reader reminded us of the old ANC Halfords jersey while another harked back to the 1960s with the thirst-quenching look of San Pellegrino.</p>\n<p>And may we introduce you to the Team Teka jersey of 1989 as modelled by Mr Malcolm Elliot that we kindly reminded of by Simon Warren of <em>100 Climbs</em>? Never have Spanish kitchen appliances looked so good.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43405\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/02/elliot_2_1989_ofs.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Finally, we must admit we were also surprised by some of the big omissions.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the avoidance of teams associated with <a href=\"/tags/lance-armstrong\">Lance Armstrong</a> was duly noted. No mentions of Discovery, US Postal or Motorola, regardless of how good those jerseys actually were. Maybe we’ve all finally had enough of Big Tex?</p>\n<p>There was no mention of the Mars-Flandria jersey either, maybe you’re all Snickers fan. And the Salvarani and multiple iterations of GAN jersey fell through the gaps too, nobody tell <a href=\"/tags/chris-boardman\">Chris Boardman</a>.</p>\n<p>But one jersey absolutely none of you mentioned that left us utterly disappointed was that of cycling’s biggest bad boys, Rock Racing. Shame on you all. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"62a0ea058357a91eb919c7ba47aeb76ba538e97b37932ef1134a78e14a11621b","category":"Cycling"}
