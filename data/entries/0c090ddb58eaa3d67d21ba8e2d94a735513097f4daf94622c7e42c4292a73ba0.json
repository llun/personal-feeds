(He was ennobled by the Swedish king, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_X_Gustav_of_Sweden\">Charles X Gustav,</a> when his diocese <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Roskilde\">passed from Danish hands</a> in 1658.) Winstrup died in late December 1679 and was buried in Lund Cathedral in January 1680. When his coffin was opened in the early 19th and 20th centuries, the body was remarkably well-preserved.</p>\n<p>So when the curators of the Lund University Historical Museum heard, in 2012, that the bishop's coffin would be moved to a new burial site outside the cathedral, they joined with scientists in a multidisciplinary collaboration to study the bishop's remains before they were reinterred. The body was X-rayed and CT-scanned, along with the bishop's clothing, various artifacts, and plant and insect remains.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755510#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755510&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0c090ddb58eaa3d67d21ba8e2d94a735513097f4daf94622c7e42c4292a73ba0","category":"Tech"}
