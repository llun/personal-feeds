Verizon also said that it is working to find the cause of the issues and will provide replacement Orbic Speed devices to customers free of charge.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll Ellipsis Jetpacks have received two over-the-air software updates related to the issue. The first displays the device's identifying number on the scrolling screen to make an exchange easier, and the second prevents the device from charging when it is plugged in and powered on to cut down on the risk of overheating.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the CPSC, Verizon has received 15 reports of devices overheating, including six cases that led to fire damage to bedding or flooring. There were two reports of minor burn injuries.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCustomers who have an affected Ellipsis Jetpack should get in touch with Verizon <a href=\"https://www.ellipsisjetpackrecall.expertinquiry.com\">through the recall website</a> to arrange a replacement.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/\">Verizon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/verizon-hotspot-recall-fire-risk/\">Verizon Recalls 2.5 Million Hotspots Due to Fire Risk</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/verizon-recalls-2-5-million-hotspots-due-to-fire-risk.2291112/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HCXFFWzpgu0:qRHfyxXL2vU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HCXFFWzpgu0:qRHfyxXL2vU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HCXFFWzpgu0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7702d13cca04234cc476216576db243862d12ad24855f76d66a1d47a89149b45","category":"Apple"}
