{"title":"Samsung Announces SmartTag+ Tile Tracker With Ultra Wideband","link":"https://news.samsung.com/us/introducing-the-new-galaxy-smarttag-plus/","date":1617921611000,"content":"\n<p>Samsung:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today announced the official launch\nof Galaxy SmartTag+, available starting on April 16. Galaxy\nSmartTag+ is equipped with both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and\nultra-wideband (UWB) technology so that it can pinpoint the\nlocation with greater accuracy. It also uses augmented reality\n(AR) technology to visually guide you towards where your missing\nitem is located using your smartphone’s camera.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ultra wideband for precise location, augmented reality for showing you where to go. Have I mentioned recently that Apple’s AirTags product — which, admittedly, the company has never mentioned — feels late?</p>\n\n<p>I still don’t get how this is more than a big $40 keychain. I’m not saying I never misplace my keys, but it doesn’t happen often enough that I’d want a big tag like this on my keyring all the time. And if I did have something this big on my keys, I’d be less likely to lose them even if the device wasn’t “smart”. All the other small things I lose track of — Apple Watch, my iPhone, my AirPods — have built-in location tracking.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/08/smarttag-plus\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2e13534c6e8e8729b04753034295439256c87f8b540c6d61adf5b33bacecfad8","category":"Tech"}
