That interface displays a game's developer and publisher name in the same font, color, and general area as the written summary of that game's overall user review summary (e.g., \"Overwhelmingly Positive,\" \"Mixed,\" \"Mostly Negative,\" etc.) Thus, it was hard for users to distinguish at a glance that the \"Very Positive\" developer name wasn't an accurate summary of <em>Emoji Evolution</em>'s actual user reviews (which ranged from \"Mixed\" to \"Mostly Positive\" according to screenshots).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743191#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743191&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91a8d9774cfd6cb0418e7f6ac741bcfa892f591fc4933f47bf1ce8654fc82b62","category":"Tech"}
