{"title":"Apple Removes 'Siri Remote' Mentions in tvOS 14.5 Beta, Changes 'Home' Button Name","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-siri-remote-tvos-14-5-beta/","date":1616528425000,"content":"Apple today <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-seeds-fifth-tvos-14-5-beta-to-developers/\">released the fifth beta</a> of tvOS 14.5, and there are some small but notable changes in the update found by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser\">Steve Moser</a>. Apple is removing mentions of the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote\" and replacing them with \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> Remote\" across the operating system.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-tv-box-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785921\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote has always been the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Remote in countries where &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality is not available on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but now Apple is using the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Remote wording in countries where the remote was previously referred to as the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis could be just a general cleanup of the language because there's no real need to refer to it as the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote anymore, but it does suggest that the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote will not be called the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote and will have a simpler name.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is rumored to be working on a new version of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; that's set to come out this year, and it will be accompanied by a refreshed remote control with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> capabilities. Little else is known about the remote at this time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\ntvOS 14.5 also renames the \"Home Button\" under the \"Remotes and Devices\" section to \"TV Button,\" but the functionality is ultimately the same and can be set to go to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app or the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>. This too could be a tweak made for a future remote.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/tv-button-tvos-14-5-tweaked.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-790528\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nEarlier betas have introduced support for the latest PlayStation and Xbox controllers, plus frame rate options have been tweaked with Apple now offering 29.97Hz and 59.94Hz refresh rates instead of 30Hz/60Hz.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/frame-rates-tvos-14-5-tweaked.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-790529\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's also an optional \"Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;\" Accessibility feature that can be enabled, which mirrors the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature on iOS devices, a new option for choosing \"Other Wireless Speakers\" as the Default Audio Output, and tweaks to the Podcasts app to bring it in line with the changes introduced in iOS 14.5.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-siri-remote-tvos-14-5-beta/\">Apple Removes &#039;Siri Remote&#039; Mentions in tvOS 14.5 Beta, Changes &#039;Home&#039; Button Name</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-siri-remote-mentions-in-tvos-14-5-beta-changes-home-button-name.2289373/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7yYMxXsToxY:9O5iyBN5HO0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7yYMxXsToxY:9O5iyBN5HO0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7yYMxXsToxY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5e48a4cdc38471927b79e64592ce2531453d6c1c65885f487b94933d8dcd0c8d","category":"Apple"}
