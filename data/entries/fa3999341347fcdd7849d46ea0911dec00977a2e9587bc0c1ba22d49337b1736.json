Every team turns up with its best kit in the hope of winning something, and every sponsor is keen to get its latest product under the spotlight.</p>\n<p>Luckily, for those limelight hungry brands, we’re here to tell you about all the latest and greatest new cycling tech we’ve spotted at the Tour, and no doubt coming to a bike shop near you soon (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/pandemic-brexit-bike-prices/\">subject to strained global supply chains</a>).</p>\n<p>After all, unless you’re the kind of nerd that works in the cycling media (like yours truly), wading through hours of race footage and thousands of press photographs can be time-consuming and dull. You, dear reader, are too good for that. Your time is too precious. So, with that in mind, we’ve done the work for you.</p>\n<p>If it’s new bikes you’re interested in, check out our other story on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/new-bikes-2021-tour-de-france/\">10 new bikes we’ve spotted at the 2021 Tour de France</a>, but, for everything else, you’re in the right place.</p>\n<p>We’ve curated a selection of the most important tech stories from this year’s Tour de France, so you don’t have to worry about missing a thing.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you can expect to see:</p>\n<ul><li>Non-sponsor correct kit is making a comeback – particularly with wheels</li>\n<li>The yellow jersey is using disc brakes</li>\n<li>The green jersey is using clinchers</li>\n<li>New fast time-trial kit</li>\n<li>All the best custom paint jobs</li>\n</ul><p>One thing you sadly won’t see here is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-dura-ace-r9200/\">new Shimano Dura-Ace groupset</a>. Having had an exclusive first look at what we believe is the next generation of Shimano’s flagship road groupset at the recent Baloise Tour of Belgium, we’ve so far only seen riders using the current generation <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-dura-ace-r9100-review/\">Dura-Ace R9100</a> at this year’s Tour.</p>\n<h2>Non-sponsor correct kit is making a comeback – particularly with wheels</h2>\n<p>Just a few short years ago, non-sponsor correct kit was de rigueur in the professional peloton. It was common to see de-badged tyres, saddles, handlebars and other bits of kit on pro bikes, as individual rider tastes were accounted for.</p>\n<p>Not all equipment is created equal, but with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/cycling-house-brands-saving-money-or-adding-value/\">house brands</a>, the ever-increasing integration of modern high-end racing bikes, and increasing sponsor influence, opportunities for fussy pros to customise their bikes had appeared to be on the wane. As we’ve commented before, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/top-5-ways-pro-bikes-are-different-to-yours/\">pro’s don’t always get to choose exactly what they want</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps following the example of the most successful Grand Tour team of the past decade, Team Ineos Grenadiers (who are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/team-ineos-lightweight-meilenstein/\">famously not afraid of using non-sponsor correct kit</a>), it seems more <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/worldtour-bikes-and-tech-whos-using-what-in-2021/\">WorldTour teams</a> are now willing to risk sponsor ire in search of performance gains.</p>\n<p>This year’s Tour sees Jumbo-Visma forgoing Shimano wheels in favour of unmarked Vision wheels for road stages and AeroCoach wheels in time trials.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/GettyImages-1327518724-1551541.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Jonas Vingegaard and other Jumbo-Visma riders have been using Vision’s new Metron 45 SL tubular wheelsets on road stages.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/GettyImages-1326318015-1e5824e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>In the time trial on stage 5, Wout van Aert had a Roval 321 rear disc wheel and an AeroCoach Titan front wheel.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nWe’re reliably informed that the Vision wheels are new models called the Metron 45 SL Disc and Metron 60 SL Disc.\n<p>Both wheelsets are said to be 20 per cent wider and around 11 per cent lighter than Vision’s previous top-end road disc brake wheels, Vision naturally claims these latest wheelsets are faster, lighter and easier to handle.</p>\n<p>The already mentioned Team Ineos Grenadiers has been using Princeton CarbonWorks, Lightweight and AeroCoach wheels for both road and time trials, again in place of Shimano wheels.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel got hold of a Princeton CarbonWorks rear disc wheel and an AeroCoach Titan front wheel for the crucial time trial in the first week, also at the expense of his team-issue Shimano wheels.

This time, though, they’re in place of team-issue Black Inc wheels.</p>\n<p>Froome’s Isreal-Start Up Nation teammate, Michael Woods, was also spotted using some rather bold five-spoke carbon wheels on the race’s first rest day. Sadly, these aren’t UCI-legal for mass-start road events, but perhaps we’ll see them in an uphill time trial at some point.</p>\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ-4P8Glp-0/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ-4P8Glp-0/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Rob Gitelis (@robgitelis)</a></p></div></blockquote><p>Sergio Hanao of Team Qhubeka NextHash has also been spotted using a pair of unreleased mid-depth <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/hunt-wheels/\">Hunt</a> wheels.</p>\n<p>Our contact at Hunt confirmed the wheels are a prototype version of the brand’s upcoming 36 UD Carbon Spoke Tubular, weighing in at a claimed 1,151g for the pair.

Presumably, the aim was to save weight, but given performance in a time trial like this one is primarily determined by a rider’s power and aerodynamic drag, it may have been a lot of work for not much gain.\n<p>What likely did help him, however, was his new skinsuit (because skinsuits cover your body, they can potentially make a significant difference to a rider’s aerodynamic efficiency). Made by team sponsor Alé, the so-called Space Jet skinsuit is using new fabrics that use surface texture roughness to help generate a turbulent boundary layer around the rider in key locations, and reduce aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/GettyImages-1326303785-f3b7c5e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Pello Bilbao had an unpainted Merida Warp TT bike and a fancy new skinsuit by Alé, called the ‘Space Jet’.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Michael Steele/Getty Images</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/BV_Ale_Jet-Skinsuit_IMG_1320-03cff97.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Space Jet skinsuit uses rough surface textures to manipulate the airflow and reduce a rider’s aerodynamic drag.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alé / Bahrain Victorious</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nWe’ve seen similar tech from a number of different clothing brands in recent years, and the concept is even used to make <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rule-28-aero-socks/\">aero socks</a> these days.
