Now that it is finally connected, anything outside of 0.8m/2.6ft away shows as a weak signal and when I can get a signal, there is never an arrow. Funnily enough, I tapped on my name about five times in frustration, and found what appears to be a hidden developer mode. Even more interesting, the arrow appears to actually be working underneath - just not in the normal mode.</blockquote>The hidden mode is unlikely to be particularly useful to the average user, and probably shouldn't be manipulated unless you know what you're doing. Still, the discovery provides an intriguing peek under the hood at the hardware and calibration involved every time an AirTag's Precision Finding is enabled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple sells individual ‌AirTags‌ for $29, while a pack of four ‌AirTags‌ can be purchased for $99.
