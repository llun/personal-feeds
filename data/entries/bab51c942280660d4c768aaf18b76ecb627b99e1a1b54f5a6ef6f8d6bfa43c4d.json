After a brief detour to the United States in 2018's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/far-cry-5-review-five-steps-back/\"><em>Far Cry 5</em></a>, this latest sequel returns to its jungles-and-islands roots, albeit in a fictional, Caribbean nation of Yara. (Which, let's be real, this is pretty much Cuba.) Instead of relying on cut scenes to showcase the striking voice and appearance of new series villain Anton Castillo, portrayed by famed actor Giancarlo Epsosito (<em>Breaking Bad</em>), this trailer goes to great lengths to look like a bonafide video game.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the revealed footage looks like a current-gen console game as played on PC at max settings. If ray-traced light-bounce models are being used in this game to create an expensive global illumination system, this trailer didn't make that apparent. Light sources look pre-baked and reflections appear to rely on computationally mild screen-space techniques. Still, wide-open vistas full of lush wildlife and massive explosions seem like they've been cranked to \"ultra\" levels, and thus I wonder how this cross-gen game will scale down to run on the PS4 and Xbox One generation.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768530#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768530&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bab51c942280660d4c768aaf18b76ecb627b99e1a1b54f5a6ef6f8d6bfa43c4d","category":"Tech"}
