India has banned a number of Chinese apps, and is now issuing visas to Chinese nationals to enter the country at a slower pace than normal. According to people familiar with the situation, India has been at a near standstill with issuing visas for Chinese engineers, who are needed for Apple suppliers in the country to set up factories or get production underway. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's important to note that countries around the world have beefed up border control measures amid the global health crisis.

Either way, however, India's tight border control does seem to be hindering production.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe news comes following reports this week that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-lobbies-india-ipad-production/\">set to announce</a> a new PLI (performance-linked incentive) scheme to bolster the country's exports of IT products such as tablets, servers, and PCs.
