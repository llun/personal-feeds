Podcasts Subscriptions is available in more than 170 countries and regions, and listeners will be able to subscribe to the podcasts they choose through the app. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple spotlighted several new seasons of popular shows and series that are now ad-free, including <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chameleon-high-rollers/id1532225667&amp;xcust=1-1-347675-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><em>Chameleon: High Rollers</em> ($2.99/month)</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revisionist-history/id1119389968&amp;xcust=1-1-347675-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\"><em>Revisionist History</em> ($4.99/month)</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/to-live-and-die-in-la/id1453788965&amp;xcust=1-1-347675-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">To Live and Die in LA ($4.99/month)</a>.
