That honor went to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/sealed-super-mario-bros-shatters-record-with-660000-auction-sale/\">a rare, sealed copy of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></a>, also for the American NES, only three months ago.</p>\n<p>This week's <em>Zelda</em> auction began with an astonishing opening bid of $110,000, yet that amount was merited by its particular rarity. The copy in question was part of a late-1987 production run dubbed \"NES R,\" which preceded the game's wider initial production run in early 1988 (dubbed \"REV-A,\" as per a marking on its box). The latter was a much wider run that coincided with the console's explosion in American popularity, and it, too, featured a foil-gold cartridge. Thus, don't assume that your shiny <em>Zelda</em> cartridge in an old drawer is somehow worth close to a million dollarsâ€”especially since this auction happens to come in a sealed, original box.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779126#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779126&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2241082a0f3ff90e5b5886a7af91653d2e940c6ca8df1e9b72465cea93518944","category":"Tech"}
