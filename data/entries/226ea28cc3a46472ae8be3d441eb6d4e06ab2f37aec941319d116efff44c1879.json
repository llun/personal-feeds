The studio just dropped the official trailer for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)\"><em>Loki</em></a>, its spinoff limited series starring Tom Hiddleston as the charismatic trickster demigod and (adoptive) brother to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/thor-ragnarok-review-a-quirky-take-on-by-the-books-fantasy-hero-fare/\">Thor</a>. According to the official premise, after absconding with the Tesseract in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/v\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>, Loki \"is a fish-out-of-water when he lands in a world of trouble with the bureaucratic TVA (Time Variance Authority).\" One Ars staffer described the overall tone as \"<em>Men in Black</em> meets <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/doctor-who/\">Doctor Who</a>,</em>\" which sounds like a winning combination to me.</p>\n<p>As we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/weve-got-our-first-real-look-at-loki-as-disney-drops-lengthy-teaser-trailer/\">reported previously,</a> Marvel Studios announced the development of its various limited series for Disney+ in 2018, all featuring supporting characters from the films who were not given their own standalone movies within the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU). Details have largely been kept under wraps, but we do know that, like <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>Loki </em>will tie into the forthcoming MCU film <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>. And like <em>Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, it will consist of six episodes. </p>\n<p>A brief shot from <em>Loki</em> that aired during the Super Bowl last year showed the titular character wearing a jumpsuit with the initials \"TVA\" stamped on it. TVA agents are the so-called \"custodians of chronology\" who monitor violations to the timeline in the MCU. Catch their attention by trying to change history, and you just might meet the wrong end of the Retroactive Cannon (Ret-Can) and have your entire history deleted from the historical timeline.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754524#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754524&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"226ea28cc3a46472ae8be3d441eb6d4e06ab2f37aec941319d116efff44c1879","category":"Tech"}
