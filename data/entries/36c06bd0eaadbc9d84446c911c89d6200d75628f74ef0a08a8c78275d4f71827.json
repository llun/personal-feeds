Here are the best bits from the team presentation .</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Words:</strong> Joe Robinson <strong>Photos</strong>: Chris Auld</p>\n<p>If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? And if a Grand Tour team presentation takes place without any fans, did it actually happen?</p>\n<p>Well yes, it did. We know this because we have photographic evidence from top snapper <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cauldphoto/?hl=en\">Chris Auld</a> who is out in Turin and set to follow the <a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia</a> for the next three weeks. We will be running daily photo galleries from Chris of each stage so keep your eyes peeled for those.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the team presentation, which was a muted affair due to that darned cornavirus, which really does ruin anything. So instead of swarms of fans lining Turin's city streets to catch a glimpse of Peter Sagan, Remco Evenepoel et al, we were left with a few dozen socially distanced dignitaries, an on-stage orchestra and a set of high-flying acrobats to greet the 184 riders set to embark on a three-week lap of Italy starting on Saturday 8th May.</p>\n<p>Anything of note from the presentation? A few things, actually. We caught a glimpse of two special edition jerseys that have been introduced for this year's Giro courtesy of Israel Start-Up Nation and EF Education-Nippo.</p>\n<p>The usual boys in blue from Israel Start-Up Nation have swapped in a wine-inspired jersey that is giving us visions of that relative everybody has – you know the one at family parties with wine-stained lips, leaning up against the bar, telling you about his timeshare? </p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/05/giro-presentation-6.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>EF on the other hand have swapped pink for a kaleidoscopic flag concoction <em>sans </em>the ducks that made last year's offering so memorable. It's cool but not as cool as the pair of Vans that Alberto Bettiol wore on stage.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe presentation also gave us our first glimpse of Egan Bernal in over 50 days, Remco Evenpoel in eight months and Dylan Groenewegen in nine months. We wonder how they will all get on? In no particular order, a few stages, maybe a white jersey and the very real possibilty of pink...</p>\n<p>We also got to see one of the race's elder statesmen, two-time winner Vincenzo Nibali. The Sicilian was sporting a cast on his right wrist having crashed six weeks prior. Weird, we thought sharks didn't have bones.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9582/giro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giro-presentation-2.jpg?itok=Vxx1Hxol\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9582/giro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation\">Giro d'Italia 2021 team presentation </a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>7 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9582%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20team%20presentation%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9582%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20team%20presentation%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9582%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20team%20presentation%20&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9582%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9582/giro-ditalia-2021-team-presentation#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giro-presentation-0.jpg?itok=3rvWvSM-\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"36c06bd0eaadbc9d84446c911c89d6200d75628f74ef0a08a8c78275d4f71827","category":"Cycling"}
