That's $10 off the indoor security camera's typical street price online and just $2 above the lowest price we've tracked to date. A two-pack of cameras is also <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3pLbWFS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on sale for $60</a>.</p>\n<p>We recommended the Indoor Cam 2K in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/the-ars-technica-ultimate-holiday-gift-guide-2020/#h16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our ultimate holiday gift guide</a> last December for offering crisp 2K-resolution video that stays clearer than most 1080p cameras in this price range during the day or night, as well as multiple video recording options and a companion app that's easy to grok on both mobile devices and <a href=\"https://mysecurity.eufylife.com/#/camera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Web</a>. Its 125-degree field of view isn't the widest we've seen, and the hardware itself doesn't feel premium, but the device still supplies a number of features found in more expensive competitors. And while Eufy itself isn't a major name, we'll note that it's the smart home <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/eufy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sister brand for Anker</a>, a better-known manufacturer of accessoriesÂ <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/best-magsafe-accessories-for-iphone-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we've tested and recommended</a> in the past.</p>\n<p>The device lets you record video locally through a microSD card or NAS, while a cloud recording service offers 30 days of storage for a relatively reasonable $3 per month or $30 per year. There's a built-in siren, a mic and speaker to issue alerts in real time, and an 8X digital zoom for getting a closer look at images. You can integrate the device with both Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant. The app can send notifications when it detects different motions or sound, including specific alerts for crying children. It's largely accurate at deciphering what is or isn't worth pinging your phone, but you can also customize the sensitivity of the motion detection and set specific activity zones for the camera to watch out for (e.g., a couch you don't want the dog to jump on).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744435#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744435&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4fbf72015b1e98c8eef40c55963bf6ece03d14a177c4b11119822b9965a5944","category":"Tech"}
