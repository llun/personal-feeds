A new rumor suggests that the iPad Pro could arrive as early as April 12 but without an event or any other products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LeaksApplePro on Twitter, who previously nailed the date of the iPhone 13 event and leaked images of the third-gen AirPods, says the new iPad Pro will land on Apple.com on Tuesday, April 13, with little more than a press release. That&rsquo;s a lot different than the rumors of a big event last month to bring new AirPods and AirTags alongside the new tablet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What would you say if I told you there isn&rsquo;t an event? <br><br>Press release for iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard next Tuesday.<br><br>AirTags delayed.</p>&mdash; LeaksApplePro (@LeaksApplePro) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1379479841175711744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-342720-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">April 6, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the iPad Pro won&rsquo;t be an excellent refresh. Apple aslo launched the iPad Pro last March with the new Magic Keyboard alongside a revamped MacBook Air via press release on Apple.comm as well as the iPhone SE in April and new AirPods Max headphones in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new iPad Pro is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/339942/three-features-that-make-the-next-ipad-pro-a-true-pro-tablet.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/339942/three-features-that-make-the-next-ipad-pro-a-true-pro-tablet.html\">rumored to gain several new features</a>, including a mini LED display that&rsquo;s brighter and more efficient, Thunderbolt 3, an improved camera, and 5G networking. It will presumably keep the same size (11 inches and 12.9 inches) and shape, but gain a much faster chip in the A14X.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld Podcast 737: Tim Cook and Apple's sway over privacy, AR, and an Apple Car","siteHash":"705dc37e1a8b3364be190c55df780a80865cd9c966dee6a0f88878efe0d436e8","entryHash":"e43a41ced2267e41250164294aacc990b31ccc17d1c5f881cc485cfd56caeea9","category":"Apple"}
