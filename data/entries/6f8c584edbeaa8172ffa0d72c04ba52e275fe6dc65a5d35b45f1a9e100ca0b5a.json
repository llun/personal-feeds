For Apple smartphone owners, that would include <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 6s and 6s Plus and newer devices. The watchdog has filed its legal claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will ultimately decide if it can go ahead.\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"We believe Qualcomm's practices are anti-competitive and have so far taken around £480m from consumers' pockets,\" said Anabel Hoult, CEO of Which? \"This needs to stop. We are sending a clear warning that if companies like Qualcomm indulge in manipulative practices which harm consumers, Which? is prepared to take action.\"</blockquote>Responding to the case, Qualcomm said it had \"no basis.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"As the plaintiffs are well aware, their claims were effectively put to rest last summer by a unanimous panel of judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States,\" a spokesman told the BBC.</blockquote>This is by no means the first time that Qualcomm has been accused of anticompetitive behavior. In 2018, Qualcomm was hit with a 997 million euro (&#36;1.2 billion) fine by EU antitrust regulators for paying Apple to use its LTE chips in iOS devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the European Commission's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/24/eu-fines-qualcomm-for-paying-apple-chip-deals/\">investigation</a>, the payments to Apple occurred from 2011 to 2016, and were made with the sole aim of blocking Qualcomm's LTE chipset market rivals, such as Intel.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2019, an antitrust lawsuit, brought against Qualcomm by the Federal Trade Commission, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/22/ftc-wins-antitrust-lawsuit-against-qualcomm/\">concluded</a> that Qualcomm's \"no license, no chips\" model that allowed it to refuse to provide chips to companies without a patent license, violated federal antitrust laws, and required Qualcomm to renegotiate all of its licensing terms with customers in good faith.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, in August 2020, Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/11/qualcomm-wins-appeal-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/\">won an appeal</a> that prevented the San Diego company from having to renegotiate its licensing agreements with smartphone makers.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/uk-watchdog-which-sues-qualcomm-competition-law/\">UK Consumer Watchdog Sues Qualcomm for Allegedly Breaching Competition Law</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-consumer-watchdog-sues-qualcomm-for-allegedly-breaching-competition-law.2286148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=A9LkvX8C1-0:pLhx-PBAy-8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=A9LkvX8C1-0:pLhx-PBAy-8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/A9LkvX8C1-0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f8c584edbeaa8172ffa0d72c04ba52e275fe6dc65a5d35b45f1a9e100ca0b5a","category":"Apple"}
