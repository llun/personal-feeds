Aduhelm is the first new Alzheimer’s drug to earn FDA approval since 2003. It’s also the first drug to target a theoretical cause of the irreversible neurodegenerative disease—clumps of beta-amyloid peptides that build up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients—rather than just treating the disease’s symptoms.</p>\n<p>The approval is, without a doubt, a landmark. It could provide hope to millions of patients, who currently have few options. And, given those limited options, it will certainly be a massive money-maker for its developer, Biogen, which has already set the list price for a year’s worth of Aduhelm at $56,000. Analysts estimate that the drug will bring in $5 billion to $6 billion worth of sales per year in the US alone.</p>\n<p>But, the FDA’s approval is far from a celebrated decision, and the drug is far from a clear success. Since the FDA’s approval yesterday, researchers and pharma watchers have called the agency’s decision “disgraceful,” “a grave error,” and a “dangerous precedent” that will end up “<a href=\"https://www.biocentury.com/article/637011/fda-s-aducanumab-decision-will-erode-public-trust-an-editor-s-commentary\">eroding confidence in the agency as a whole</a>.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771616#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771616&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d429c617db33025e9287da91f0fa77217bd67cddd52f23f87b7a2fd36c898dd","category":"Tech"}
