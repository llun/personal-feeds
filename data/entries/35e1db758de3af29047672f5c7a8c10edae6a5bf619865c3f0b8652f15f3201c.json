Proof-of-concept exploit code was publicly released and then pulled back, but not before others had copied it. Researchers track the vulnerability as CVE-2021-34527.</p>\n<h2>A big deal</h2>\n<p>Attackers that can exploit print capabilities are exposed to the Internet. Attackers can also use it to escalate system privileges once they’ve used a different vulnerability to gain a toe-hold inside of a vulnerable network. In either case, the adversaries can then gain control of the domain controller, which as the server that authenticates local users, is one of the most security-sensitive assets on any Windows network.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778734#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778734&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"35e1db758de3af29047672f5c7a8c10edae6a5bf619865c3f0b8652f15f3201c","category":"Tech"}
