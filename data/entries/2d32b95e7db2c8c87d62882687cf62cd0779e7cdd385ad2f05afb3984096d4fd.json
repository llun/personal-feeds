This is an increase of 13.2 percent from the second quarter of 2020, in spite of component shortages across the industry that constrained supply.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIDC analysis noted that while annual growth remains high, it has begun to taper off as the 13 percent growth rate in the second quarter of 2021 is far lower than the 55.9 percent growth in the first quarter of 2021 and 25.8 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. Neha Mahajan, senior research analyst with IDCâ€™s Devices and Displays Group, commented:\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The market faces mixed signals as far as demand is concerned With businesses opening back up, demand potential in the commercial segment appears promising. However, there are also early indicators of consumer demand slowing down as people shift spending priorities after nearly a year of aggressive PC buying.\"</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple remained the fourth-largest PC vendor, tied with Acer, surpassed only by Lenovo, HP, and Dell, of which each had over double the number of shipments compared to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/idc-pc-shipments-q2-2021.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple does not disclose exact Mac shipment figures, meaning that the data provided by IDC is estimated. An equivalent report from <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/Canalys-global-PC-market-Q2-2021\">Canalys</a> placed Apple's annual growth at 19.8 percent, but showed shipment estimates in a similar range.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's fiscal <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/apple-mac-revenue-growth-q2-2021/\">second quarter earnings call</a> showed steady growth of Mac revenue broadly in line with IDC's estimates, but Apple has not yet reported on this period.
