Deer understand that they should steer clear of wolves. And new research suggests that regions with wolves tend to have a markedly lower rate of deer-automobile collisions, as the predators scare their prey away from roadways. According to the study's researchers, this indirect benefit of managing wolves in a region can save humans a lot of money.</p>\n<p>The research, which focuses on counties in the Great Lakes region, began in 2013.
