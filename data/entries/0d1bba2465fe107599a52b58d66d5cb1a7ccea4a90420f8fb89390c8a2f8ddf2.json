Victor Fiorillo, reporting for Philadelphia Magazine: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Lê, he polled his staff and regulars to ask them if\n<em>they</em> thought he should require proof of vaccination, the same\nway he requires government-issued identification and dress-code\ncompliance, and the answer was a unanimous yes.</p>\n\n<p>While proof of vaccination and, hell, the COVID vaccine itself\nhave somehow turned into political theater, Lê insists this isn’t\nabout politics for him.</p>\n\n<p>“We can’t emphasize enough that it is <em>not</em> a political statement\nof any kind,” he told us. “However, our staff is mentally prepared\nto be cursed at … on a good day and [endure] racist or homophobic\ncomments on an OK day from those individuals with a sense of\nentitlement. But if you look on the bright side of things, if\nthese people would say stupid stuff like that at the gate, then\nthere’s no reason they should be drinking in the first place, so\nthe staff look at it as a silver lining.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I, of course, voted yes.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/28/hop-sing-vaccination-proof\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0d1bba2465fe107599a52b58d66d5cb1a7ccea4a90420f8fb89390c8a2f8ddf2","category":"Tech"}
