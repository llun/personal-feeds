Our tester praised its blend of speed and comfort over rough terrain.</p>\n<p>The new V+1 will ship from April onwards with framesets starting at £3,399 and complete builds from £4,799.</p>\n<h2>Racy, road-flavoured gravel</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/V1_Gen2_7544_010-709aa39.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Vielo V+1 Alto with Shimano GRX Di2.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Vielo</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/V1_Gen2_435_023-6c46bf4.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Vielo V+1 Alto with SRAM Force eTap AXS.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Vielo</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/V1_Gen2_5655_096-1c7be7a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Vielo V+1 Strato with Campagnolo Ekar.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Vielo</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/V1_Gen2_5205_030-f4756f9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Vielo V+1 Strato with Shimano GRX mechanical. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Vielo</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The second-generation V+1 aims to retain the qualities we liked so much in the first and focuses even more on the performance end of the gravel spectrum.</p>\n<p>The bike is explicitly designed to be racy; it’s not pitched at the bikepacking-and-chill-seeking rider, and there’s no option to run a front derailleur – it’s 1×-only.</p>\n<p>There are two V+1 frame options. The Strato is the more affordable model with a frame weighing a claimed 1,100g in an unspecified size. The top-spec Alto is seriously light at a claimed 880g.</p>\n<p>Weight aside, Vielo says the lighter frame is marginally stiffer thanks to a different lay-up, but both come out of the same moulds so the shapes are identical.</p>\n<p>Although the latest V+1 strongly resembles its predecessor, Vielo describes it as a full redesign.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The V+1’s frameset looks clean and elegant.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Vielo</i></span></div>\n<p>The new bikes feature a lower bottom bracket, shorter seat tube and longer top tube, bringing the rider lower and further forward for a racier position and lower centre of gravity.</p>\n<p>While not as extreme as some on the market, Vielo’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">geometry</a> could certainly be called progressive for gravel.</p>\n<p>A size medium has 393mm of reach favouring fairly short stems, while the stack of 572mm is middling to low for gravel, in keeping with the bike’s racy intentions.</p>\n<p>Along with a reasonably slack 70.5mm head angle, the medium’s wheelbase is a lengthy 1,057mm, suggesting it won’t be too flighty on rough terrain.</p>\n<h3>Vielo V+1 geometry and sizing</h3>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿</th><th>XS</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seat tube (mm)</td><td>410</td><td>445</td><td>480</td><td>515</td><td>550</td>        </tr><tr><td>Horizontal top tube (mm)</td><td>505</td><td>530</td><td>555</td><td>580</td><td>605</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube (mm)</td><td>100</td><td>122.5</td><td>145</td><td>165</td><td>187.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay (mm)</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td>        </tr><tr><td>BB drop (mm)</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.5</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>70</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube angle (°)</td><td>75.25</td><td>74.75</td><td>74.25</td><td>73.75</td><td>73.25</td>        </tr><tr><td>Fork rake (mm)</td><td>48</td><td>48</td><td>48</td><td>48</td><td>48</td>        </tr><tr><td>Fork length (mm)</td><td>407.5</td><td>407.5</td><td>407.5</td><td>407.5</td><td>407.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube angle ( °)</td><td>70</td><td>70.25</td><td>70.5</td><td>70.75</td><td>71</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>1017.6</td><td>1038.7</td><td>1056.8</td><td>1075.6</td><td>1092.7</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>364.9</td><td>380</td><td>393.1</td><td>408</td><td>419.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack (mm)</td><td>530.3</td><td>552.2</td><td>572.1</td><td>592.2</td><td>614.3</td>        </tr><tr><td>Rider height (imperial)</td><td>5'3\" - 5'6\"</td><td>5'5\" - 5'9\"</td><td>5'8\" - 6'1\"</td><td>6' - 6'4\"</td><td>6'3\" - 6'7\"</td>        </tr><tr><td>Rider height (metric)</td><td>160 - 167</td><td>165 - 175</td><td>173 - 184</td><td>183 - 193</td><td>190 - 201</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>Vielo has done away with the dropped chainstay design and gone symmetrical instead, but has still managed to increase tyre clearances.</p>\n<p>With a new and supposedly stiffer fork as well, there’s now apparently room for 700×50mm or 650×50mm tyres at both ends.</p>\n<p>The new bike’s head tube now sports a fashionable – and potentially more aero – hourglass shape.</p>\n<p>Each frame option comes in two paintjobs and we’re pleased to report that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/enough-with-the-black-bikes-already/\">none are boring black</a>.</p>\n<p>The best news of all is Vielo has retained the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bikes-with-fender-mounts/\">mudguard (fender) mounts</a> making the bike all the more appealing for year-round all-road antics.</p>\n<h2>Vielo V+1 specs and pricing</h2>\n<h3>V+1 Alto</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Frameset:</strong> £3,899</li>\n<li><strong>SRAM Force Mullet build:</strong> £6,299</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano GRX Di2 build:</strong> £5,999</li>\n</ul><h3>V+1 Strato</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Frameset:</strong> £3,399</li>\n<li><strong>Campagnolo Ekar build:</strong> £5,699</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano GRX mechanical build:</strong> £4,799</li>\n</ul>","author":"Matthew Loveridge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c8e4b27b02c394631615182d1cd28bd503b31ec523889069ea331dd61fd5cfe0","category":"Cycling"}
