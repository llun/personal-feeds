What's causing the holdup isn't clear. The delay could wipe out the FCC's ability to do anything opposed by Republicans for all of 2021, because it can take the Senate months to approve FCC nominations, and the FCC process for complicated rulemakings is also lengthy.</p>\n<p>Biden today released a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/\">fact sheet</a> describing an executive order focused on boosting competition in numerous industries. The order targets four broadband problems that Biden's order \"encourages\" the FCC to solve: deals between ISPs and landlords that limit tenants' choices; misleading advertised prices; high termination fees; and net neutrality.
