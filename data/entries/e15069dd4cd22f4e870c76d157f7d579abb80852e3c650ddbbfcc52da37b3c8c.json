Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) was able to hold onto the world champion to take second on the stage and overall with Demi Vollering (SD Worx) taking third. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A split of 30 riders was condensed down to four with 4 km to go and continued to lose riders as the climb progressed. SD Worx chased from behind to keep Niamh Fisher-Black close to the riders out front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within 2 km of the finish, the gap to those out front went from a minute and a half down to less than 40 seconds. Fisher-Black was distanced from the remnants of the peloton with 1.3 km to go with stage 3 winner Cecilie Uttrup-Ludwig (FDJ Nouvelle Aquitaine Futuroscope) as Van der Breggen, Vollering and Van Vleuten rode off together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Breggen, Vollering, and Van Vleuten caught the two riders out front with 750 meters remaining. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Into the final hundred meters Van der Breggen outsprinted Van Vleuten to take the stage victory as well as the overall lead from her Dutch competitor with Vollering taking third on the stage. </p>\n\n\n    <div>\n
