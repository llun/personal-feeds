We've seen wide-angle cameras, telephoto cameras, depth cameras, macro cameras, and now... a microscope camera? The new Oppo Find X3 Pro has a \"microlens sensor with up to 60x zoom\" that can take some interesting super-close-up shots.</p>\n<p>We've loved the macro cameras that have popped up on some phones, mainly from Oppo's sister company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/oneplus-8-pro-review-the-best-flagship-of-2020-even-if-it-is-more-expensive/\">OnePlus</a>. Oppo's micro camera sounds like a next-gen version of the same idea. We're not going to trust a manufacturer's professionally shot sample pictures, but a few third parties like <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/11/oppos-new-microscope-camera-will-let-you-see-things-youve-never-seen-with-a-smartphone/\">Android Police</a> have gotten their hands on the phone and turned in some truly impressive pictures that haven't been possible from a smartphone before.</p>\n<p>Like you'd expect, the sample pictures out there all have a very shallow depth-of-field, and it looks like focusing is a challenge. That's true of regular macro photography, too, though. Most people are doing hand-held shots, and a full tripod-style setup would probably help a lot. The \"Micro\" camera sensor is only 3 MP, but unlike some of the useless \"decorative\" 2 MP cameras we see on cheaper phones, this seems to be plenty for a close-up.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748768#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748768&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ad532863a754bc90ab20bc1270ec5df81d5771fd817e5007367cc58e61fabda","category":"Tech"}
