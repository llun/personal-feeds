The \"OLED Model\" as Nintendo is calling it, will be available October 8 for an MSRP of $349.99.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, the most immediately noticeable improvement is in the screen, which uses <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/oled-explained-incredible-tech-but-what-about-cost-and-content/\">pricier OLED technology</a> instead of the more common standard LCD found in previous Switch models. This should provide deeper blacks, better color display, and less motion blurring than existing Switch systems, if existing OLED TVs are anything to go by.</p>\n<p>The OLED Model also expands the Switch's screen to 7\", up from the 6.2\" of the original Switch and 5.5\" of the Switch Lite. This is accomplished without increasing the size of the standard Switch unit itself, thanks to a reduction in the space used for the black bezel around the tablet screen.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778301#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778301&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0610dca93cf6567e374ddfabf4b5146046a9a4fc5065f215cb09934c93575f1a","category":"Tech"}
