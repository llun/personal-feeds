It's dying at the end of the month.  (credit: <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/\">Samsung</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Samsung has spent the last year or so <a href=\"https://community.smartthings.com/t/announcement-changes-to-our-legacy-smartthings-platform/197958/1\">upending its SmartThings ecosystem</a>. SmartThings was born as an independent company in 2012 when it launched one of the largest Kickstarter campaigns ever: a $1.2 million funding program for the company's first smart home hub. Samsung bought SmartThings in 2014, and in June 2020, the Korean giant announced a plan that would basically shut down all of the stuff it acquired, forcing everyone over to in-house Samsung infrastructure. A big part of that plan is happening at the end of the month, when <a href=\"https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055814272?mc_cid=026651d309&amp;mc_eid=e491dbb04b\">Samsung will kill the first-generation SmartThings Hub</a>.</p>\n<p>The SmartThings Hub is basically a Wi-Fi access point—but for your smart home stuff instead of your phones and laptops. Instead of Wi-Fi, SmartThings is the access point for a Zigbee and Z-Wave network, two ultra low-power mesh networks used by smart home devices. Wi-Fi is great for loading webpages and videos, but it's extreme overkill for something like turning on a light switch or working a door sensor; these things need to just send a few bits for \"on or off\" or \"open or closed.\" Zigbee and Z-Wave are so low-power that you can run the devices on AA or coin cell batteries for months. The Hub connects your smart home network to the Internet, giving you access to a control app and connecting to other services like your favorite voice assistant.</p>\n<p>You might think that killing the old Hub could be a ploy to sell more hardware, but Samsung—a hardware company—is actually <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/exclusive-why-samsungs-smartthings-is-going-all-in-on-software-2020-6\">no longer interested</a> in making SmartThings hardware. The company passed manufacturing for the latest \"SmartThings Hub (v3)\" to German Internet-of-things company Aeotec. The new Hub is normally $125, but Samsung is offering existing users a dirt-cheat $35 upgrade price.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769531#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769531&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1c8c401430e954f265b0c884676de1a522d8b8802e5a28142ef0f78328346a9d","category":"Tech"}
