Young adult audiences reportedly fueled the momentum of new subscribers since the film premiered on Thursday, February 25, and half of the film's audience came from outside the United States.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe documentary is described as a \"true coming of age story,\" following the young singer-songwriter and her rise to stardom. It offers an intimate look into her journey as a seventeen-year-old navigating life on the road, stage, and at home with her family while she writes, records, and releases her first album.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple paid &#36;25 million for the R.J. Cutler-directed documentary <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/apple-pays-25-million-billie-eilish-documentary/\">in December 2019</a>, battling against other streaming services for the rights in a bidding war. The record-breaking increase in subscribers and the capture of the young adult audience indicates that the move seems to have paid off.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/billie-eilish-documentary-drew-record-subscribers/\">Apple TV+ Billie Eilish Documentary Drew Record Number of New Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-billie-eilish-documentary-drew-record-number-of-new-subscribers.2287023/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rfXGnjDnZjA:zurlK3f1o2I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rfXGnjDnZjA:zurlK3f1o2I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rfXGnjDnZjA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1fadc052b3696d95f7f702f4fc77dfa502d37c20732511642474050553fba30f","category":"Apple"}
