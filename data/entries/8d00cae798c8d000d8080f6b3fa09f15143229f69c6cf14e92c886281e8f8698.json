It's unclear if this is an intentional change by Twitter to direct users towards its platforms, or if it is simply a bug. We've reached out to Twitter for comment and we'll provide an update if we hear back.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA similar issue with Instagram links in iMessage cropped up a few months ago, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/instagram-to-fix-imessage-link-preview-bug/\">ended up being a bug</a> that was fixed thereafter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this week, Twitter rolled out support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/twitter-larger-image-previews-ios/\">larger image previews in the timeline</a> in its iOS and Android apps, meaning that tall images will no longer be cropped into a 16:9 layout. Twitter is also rolling out a <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html\">new Tip Jar feature</a> that allows users to tip eligible accounts held by creators, journalists, experts, and non-profit organizations.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/\">iMessage</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/twitter-link-previews-imessage-broken/\">It's Not Just You: Tweet Previews Aren't Showing in iMessage Right Now</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/its-not-just-you-tweet-previews-arent-showing-in-imessage-right-now.2295245/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E0VJ_ICU3Vw:qAd-4bMNuTQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E0VJ_ICU3Vw:qAd-4bMNuTQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/E0VJ_ICU3Vw\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d00cae798c8d000d8080f6b3fa09f15143229f69c6cf14e92c886281e8f8698","category":"Apple"}
