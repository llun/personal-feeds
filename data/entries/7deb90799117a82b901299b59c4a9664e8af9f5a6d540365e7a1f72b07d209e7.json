Rather, it's a significant refinement of an idea that, up until now, has been fairly niche. It works very, very well, but it works so well it seems to undermine Apple's attempts to focus its products on privacy and security.</p>\n<p>We spent several days testing AirTags in different situations, and we found that they work stunningly well—at least in a dense urban environment with iPhones all around.</p>\n<p>I can't imagine recommending any of the preceding attempts at this concept over AirTags if you have an iPhone. (Sadly, Android users are quite literally left to their own devices—in more ways than usual, as you'll see later in this review.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760614#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760614&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7deb90799117a82b901299b59c4a9664e8af9f5a6d540365e7a1f72b07d209e7","category":"Tech"}
