In addition to being convenient, this wireless connectivity will soon become more important, as reputable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously claimed that Apple will introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">at least one high-end iPhone without a Lightning connector</a> this year, resulting in the device being completely portless.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe fourth-generation Outlander is equipped with a 9-inch touchscreen that provides access to both wireless CarPlay and Android Auto. Wireless smartphone charging is also available alongside standard USB-A and USB-C charging ports.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDepending on the trim level, the 2022 Outlander can be fitted with up to 20-inch wheels, a 10.8-inch heads-up display on the windshield, a 10-speaker Bose audio system, a panoramic sunroof, and other options. The vehicle is powered by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine and is equipped with three-row seating as standard equipment.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMitsubishi says the 2022 Outlander will be available at North American dealerships starting April 2021, with U.S. pricing starting at &#36;25,795.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWireless CarPlay is finally beginning to see wider adoption, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/15/honda-hyundai-wireless-carplay/\">several automakers now rolling out the feature</a> in select regions, including Hyundai, Honda, Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. Car audio brands like Alpine and Pioneer also offer aftermarket wireless CarPlay receivers for do-it-yourself installation.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wireless-carplay/\">wireless CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mitsubishi/\">Mitsubishi</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/20/mitsubishi-wireless-carplay/\">Mitsubishi Begins Adopting Wireless CarPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mitsubishi-begins-adopting-wireless-carplay.2285539/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HnQjLP40cdo:58NEx5jXL3Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HnQjLP40cdo:58NEx5jXL3Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HnQjLP40cdo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d50ca20fd5958665ad0ec1fc4553d8366608443d796e8e7d93da96c620f75ac","category":"Apple"}
