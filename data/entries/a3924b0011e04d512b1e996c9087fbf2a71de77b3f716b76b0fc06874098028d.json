{"title":"iOS 15 Photos App Tells You Which Apps Saved Images Originated From","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/ios-15-photos-app-shows-where-images-saved-from/","date":1623661152000,"content":"In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, Apple has made some welcome improvements to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app, such as the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/photos-app-images-exif-info/\">see the EXIF data for a photo</a>. The latter feature is accessed via a new \"Info\" button, which also brings up a caption field for the selected photo, the location where the photo was taken, and any Look Up information available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ios-15-photos-saved-from.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the above, the Info button will also tell you which app on your device that an image was saved from if you didn't take it using your camera. For instance, in the example above, you can see that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> image was saved from the web via Safari. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis metadata information also acts like an organizing tag, so if you tap the \"Saved from\" location in bold, the ‌Photos‌ app will filter your photo library to show you any other images that were saved from the same app, meaning you don't have to scroll endlessly for any others that might be in your camera roll. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new feature adds another organizational layer to your photos, allowing you to, say, find all the images you've saved from Messages or WhatsApp conversation threads without having to go into the apps themselves.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌iOS 15‌ is available as an early developer beta, with a public beta due to be released next month and an official release set to drop this fall.  <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/ios-15-photos-app-shows-where-images-saved-from/\">iOS 15 Photos App Tells You Which Apps Saved Images Originated From</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-photos-app-tells-you-which-apps-saved-images-originated-from.2300830/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AZNfmm7Cwtw:oTZEzcmesqQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AZNfmm7Cwtw:oTZEzcmesqQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AZNfmm7Cwtw\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3924b0011e04d512b1e996c9087fbf2a71de77b3f716b76b0fc06874098028d","category":"Apple"}
