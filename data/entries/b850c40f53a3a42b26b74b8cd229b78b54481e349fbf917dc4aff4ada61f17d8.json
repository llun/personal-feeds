Previously, Apple kept its tools under lock and key, but independent repair shops will now offer &ldquo;the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics&rdquo; as an Apple Authorized Service Provider. The program, which was limited to iPhones at launch, now includes all Apple products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Repair shops big and small will be able to take advantage of the new program without going through Apple&rsquo;s rigorous certification to become an Authorized Service Provider.

Additionally, shops must be located in a commercially zoned area, so people won&rsquo;t be able to run Apple-backed repair shops out of their garage. Otherwise, there is no cost to join the repair program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find a list of the countries where the program is launching this week and later this year <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally/&amp;subid1=1-1-233214-0-0-0\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apples-independent-repair-provider-program-expands-globally/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"WWDC 2021: Apple to unveil iOS 15, macOS 12 on June 7","siteHash":"8b0a0c337f9aa4c706051414e6511d7d826ad1740bcf53cdaa2fee95365538f6","entryHash":"b850c40f53a3a42b26b74b8cd229b78b54481e349fbf917dc4aff4ada61f17d8","category":"Apple"}
