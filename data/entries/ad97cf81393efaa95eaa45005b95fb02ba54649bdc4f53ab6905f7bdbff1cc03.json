Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-seeking-engineers-work-on-6g/\">believed to</a> have begun work on next-generation 6G wireless technologies.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith Apple seeking to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-developing-modem-in-house/\">move away</a> from reliance on other companies for wireless technologies, it is unclear how a deal with Huawei may pan out. Though Apple could take advantage of Huawei's expansive portfolio of 5G patents to develop its own wireless technologies, the company's apparent desire for independence in this area may mire the chances of a sustainable long-term agreement.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/\">patent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/\">Huawei</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/\">5G</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/huawei-royalties-from-apple-samsung-for-5g/\">Huawei to Negotiate Royalties From Apple and Samsung for 5G Technology</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/huawei-to-negotiate-royalties-from-apple-and-samsung-for-5g-technology.2288488/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ojLqb-Q8WDM:jnufv5fl21o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ojLqb-Q8WDM:jnufv5fl21o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ojLqb-Q8WDM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ad97cf81393efaa95eaa45005b95fb02ba54649bdc4f53ab6905f7bdbff1cc03","category":"Apple"}
