While it may come as a surprise, news of an Apple podcast subscription service is not entirely new. <em>Bloomberg</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-podcast-subscription-service/\">The Information</a></em> have both independently reported that Apple is in talks with production companies to produce new original shows for the service.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEven without the new service, Apple has launched several original podcast shows based on content from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, such as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/apple-launches-true-crime-podcast-series-the-line/\">The Line</a>.\" Further corroborating rumors of a paid service, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1374086069654843398\">changes found within the Podcasts app on iOS 14.5</a> by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser indicate that Apple is reworking the app with more subscription-centric features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's \"Spring Loaded\" event will officially kick off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time via a live stream on Apple's website and YouTube channel.
