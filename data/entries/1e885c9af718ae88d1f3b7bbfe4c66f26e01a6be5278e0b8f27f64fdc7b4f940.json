The new build offers significant memory savings on 64-bit Windows platforms thanks to increased use of Google's <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/base/allocator/partition_allocator/PartitionAlloc.md\">PartitionAlloc</a> memory allocator. On macOS, Chrome 89 plays catch-up and gets closer to the performance of the flagship Windows builds.</p>\n<h2>Chrome on Windows</h2>\n<p>Google says use of RAM in 64-bit Windows is down up to 22 percent in the browser process, 8 percent in the renderer, and 3 percent in the GPU. The company also claims a 9 percent decrease in latency, meaning a more responsive browser. The improvements are largely due to intercepting <code>malloc()</code> calls with <code>PartitionAlloc</code>.</p>\n<p>Chrome 89 has also gotten significantly more aggressive about discarding unused RAM. When you scroll resources such as large images off-screen in the foreground tab, Chrome discards the memory those resources used. The change impacts background tabs as well, resulting in a savings of as much as 100MiB per tab.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749178#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749178&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e885c9af718ae88d1f3b7bbfe4c66f26e01a6be5278e0b8f27f64fdc7b4f940","category":"Tech"}
