This will be Russia's first significant addition to the International Space Station in more than a decade, and it will provide the Russians with their first module dedicated primarily to research. \"Nauka\" means science in Russian.</p>\n<p>This is a sizable module, including crew quarters, an airlock for scientific experiments, and much more. With a mass of about 24 metric tons, it is about 20 percent larger than the biggest Russian segment of the station, the Zvezda service module.</p>\n<p>The timing for this launch, scheduled for as early as July 15 on a Proton rocket, is notable. For one, the multi-purpose Nauka module is more than a dozen years late due to a lack of budget for the project on top of technical issues. At times, it seemed like the module was never actually going to launch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776683#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776683&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"608b16d4ccd109eaba4382d4237a5bb939b3a39bfd50db83a3f48b6664d637d3","category":"Tech"}
