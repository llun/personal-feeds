Although &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; sales grew by 42 percent in 2016, the 38 percent growth in 2020 significantly exceeds the 27 percent year-on-year increase seen between 2018 and 2019 when it rose from &#36;79 to &#36;100.\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/us-iphone-revenue-per-device-2015-to-2020.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1522\" height=\"1064\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792127\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn particular, per-device spending on mobile games saw explosive growth in 2020, jumping from &#36;53.80 in 2019 to &#36;76.80 for year-on-year growth of 43 percent. The biggest source of spending on mobile games was in the Puzzle category, which includes games like Candy Crush Saga and Gardenscapes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/us-iphone-category-revenue-per-device-2020.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1522\" height=\"1064\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792126\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to mobile games, per-iPhone spending in the Entertainment category boomed, reaching &#36;10.20, which is an increase of 26 percent over the &#36;8.10 spent in 2019.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis large increase in consumer spending per &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/app-store-sales-saw-unprecedented-growth-in-2020/\">mirrored overall global trends</a>, which saw consumers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/30/more-than-100-billion-spent-on-app-stores-2020/\">spending more overall last year</a> as they turned to their mobile devices during the global health crisis. Average consumer spending on apps per &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the U.S. has grown markedly each year by at least 20 percent, but it is yet to be seen if the trend will continue into 2021.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sensor-tower/\">Sensor Tower</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/iphone-users-spent-138-on-apps/\">iPhone Users Spent Average of &#36;138 on Apps Last Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-users-spent-average-of-138-on-apps-last-year.2290402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dg-CtvifY2Q:uhHa5dkn8I4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dg-CtvifY2Q:uhHa5dkn8I4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dg-CtvifY2Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a006c91984fd1024a6aaa33f8e29060bf16fb9a6e771000dcdda31bae7a79e66","category":"Apple"}
