{"title":"David Cicilline’s Anchoring Strategy","link":"https://stratechery.com/2021/the-cicilline-salvo/","date":1624310153000,"content":"\n<p>Ben Thompson, writing last week about the four legislative proposals released by the House Subcommittee on Antitrust:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don’t think it is an accident that these bills were presented as\na package, but I think it has been a mistake in a lot of coverage\nto view the package as one bill. It seems to me that Chairman\nCicilline has played his cards very deftly here: start with the\nfact that while every bill was authored by a Democrat, they all\nhave a Republican co-sponsor; if some combination of these\nregulations pass they will likely be with overwhelmingly\nDemocratic support, but the fact they are starting out as\nnominally bi-partisan efforts is savvy.</p>\n\n<p>The real tell about Cicilline’s strategy, though, is the seeming\ncontradictions between his own bill and that of Representative\nJayapal. Cicilline seeks to restrict platforms from behaving in\nnon-discriminatory ways, with the threat of break-up if they\ndon’t, while Jayapal jumps straight to break-up. This strikes me\nas an anchoring strategy: Jayapal’s approach is both unworkable\nand undesirable — it leaves the FTC and ultimately the courts as\nthe ultimate arbiter of what is part of a core platform’s offering\nand what rests on top, and not only does that evolve as technology\nmatures, it also makes it impossible to deliver an experience that\nis approachable for regular consumers. As I noted above, is a\nnetworking stack part of an operating system? Is a browser? Is an\nApp Store? Moreover, Jayapal’s bill, if enacted, makes Cicilline’s\nbill immaterial: there would be nothing to discriminate against.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I suspect that Cicilline’s goal is to stake out the\nmost extreme position — the Jayapal bill — with the goal of\ngetting his own bill passed as a compromise, perhaps with\nScanlon’s as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s Thompson’s description of Jayapal’s bill:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I]nstead of banning discriminatory behavior it simply bans\nplatforms from owning any product or service that rest on top of\nits platform and compete with 3rd-parties in any way. The\nprovision is as broad as it sounds, which is interesting to think\nabout in a historical context: operating systems used to sell the\nnetworking stack separately — would it be illegal now for iOS to\ninclude TCP/IP? That’s just one obvious example of how this bill\nwould quickly devolve into product design by the judiciary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t think it’s any exaggeration to say that the Jayapal bill would profoundly change Apple and all of Apple’s products, platforms, and above all, services — in ways that ultimately would be ruinous for the company as we know it. It’s a “throw the baby out with the bathwater” bill that betrays a profound misunderstanding of how platforms evolve. Even if it is just an anchoring strategy to make Cicilline’s own bill look moderate in comparison, Apple should be extremely concerned that Jayapal’s bill is even on the table.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/21/cicilline-anchoring-strategy\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c54fc864ba0f0f3eca4bb62ae62e97b9cf3964fe3f0835dde8837bac98bf2e78","category":"Tech"}
