The town is almost ever present on the Tour de France these days — the Tour has visited five times in the previous ten years. Most recently, Albertville hosted the start of the shortened stage 20 in 2019, where Vincenzo Nibali won from the breakaway and Egan Bernal secured the yellow jersey. </span></p>\n<p><span>This year, there are no categorised climbs on the menu bar the Col de Couz. The ascent begins 51 kilometres in and averages 2.8% over 7.4 kilometres. A single KOM point lies at the top for the first rider to cross, meaning the leader of the king of the mountains classification doesn’t need to be in the breakaway to defend the polka-dot jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span>The next point of note takes place at kilometre 82 in La Placette with the intermediate sprint. This time, the sprint finishes atop the Col de la Placette which is four kilometres in length and averages just under 4%. The pure sprinters will struggle to take any points here, meaning this is a great opportunity for Sonny Colbrelli or Michael Matthews to gain ground in the green jersey competition. </span></p>\n<p><span>The next 55 kilometres are mainly flat. The major obstacle before the finish in Valence is an uncategorised climb which peaks 35 kilometres from the finish. The ascent is over 5 kilometres long but not particularly steep at 3.8%. However, BikeExchange, Bora-hansgrohe and Bahrain-Victorious could all see this as an opportunity to push the pure sprinters out the back for their leaders. Bora employed this tactic at the Giro d’Italia to great effect this year which allowed Peter Sagan to win stage 10. </span></p>\n<p><span>Nonetheless, a mass-sprint is anticipated in Valence. The major obstacle in the final kilometres is a right turn around 400 metres from the finish. The lead out trains will be tasked with entering this corner first, as there isn’t enough time to make up lost ground afterwards.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<h4>\n<b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1326467744-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625318760\" /></b><em>Image credit: Stephane Mahe - Pool/Getty Images</em><b><br /></b>\n</h4>\n<p><span>Despite the 1,500 metres of climbing over the stage, </span><b>Mark Cavendish</b><span> enters as the clear favourite. The Manx Missile is back to his best with two Tour de France stage victories in the bag this season. That takes his career tally to 32, just two shy of</span> Eddy Merckx<span>’s all-time record of 34. He doesn’t want to talk about it, but we will. A win in Valence for Cavendish would place him just one victory behind Merckx with numerous sprint chances to come. </span><b>Davide Ballerini</b><span> and </span><b>Michael <span>Mørkøv </span></b><span>are his leadout men and placed him well to jump to Jasper Philipsen’s wheel on stage 6 in Châteauroux.</span></p>\n<p><span>Alpecin-Fenix have two stage wins at the Tour de France already. As a ProTeam, this can only be considered a success. However,</span><b> Jasper Philipsen </b><span>has been beaten by Cavendish twice when chosen as leader ahead of the rapid </span><b>Tim Merlier,</b><span> which is the only sour note for the team. Philipsen will be more comfortable on the climbs than Merlier, but if Merlier is present for the finish, Alpecin must consider their options. Merlier may be their best bet if they are to beat Cavendish. </span><b>Mathieu van der Poel</b><span> and </span><b>Jonas Rickaert </b><span>are the initial leadout men and have done a fine job at the Tour so far in this regard.</span></p>\n<p><b>Nacer Bouhanni</b><span> is one of the surprises thus far. The 30-year-old had never finished in the top three of a Tour de France stage before but has achieved that feat three times this year already. A win still eludes him though. Bouhanni only needs a Tour de France stage to complete the Grand Tour stage trilogy having already won at the Vuelta and Giro.</span></p>\n<p><span>If </span><b>Michael Matthews, Peter Sagan </b><span>or </span><b>Sonny Colbrelli</b><span> are to stand a chance, they must shake things up. They cannot lead Cavendish to the line and hope to beat him — Cav appears to be too confident, powerful and tactically astute at the moment. This means that Bora, BikeExchange and Bahrain could all try to make things difficult on the climbs to push Cavendish and Merlier out the back. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, the only categorised ascent occurs 130 kilometres from the finish which means the uncategorised Beauregard-Baret is their only choice. At only 4%, this isn’t as difficult as the Valico della Somma which Bora utilised at the Giro d’Italia earlier this year. It’s a bold, aggressive strategy, but may be their best chance of winning the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other sprinters with a chance include </span><strong>Arnaud Démare</strong><b>, Wout Van Aert,</b> <b>Bryan Coquard, Cees Bol </b><span>and </span><b>Mads Pedersen</b><span>.</span></p>\n<em>Cover image: Michael Steele/Getty Images</em>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"8ccf8f38c6e1e2964f2f6fd8fe40392b2aa007a16240bb3277233c1d16fbfe6b","category":"Cycling"}
