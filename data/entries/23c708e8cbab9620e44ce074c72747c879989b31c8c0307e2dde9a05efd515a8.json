However, it's not clear if discussions with CATL and BYD involved any of Apple's own technology or designs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe last few months has seen a flurry of reports, some conflicting, about potential specifics on an ‌‌Apple Car‌‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple appears to be intensely researching all aspects of car engineering and manufacturing, but there are questions around what form Apple's vehicle project may take, with some reports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/apple-seen-in-vehicle-supply-chains/\">suggesting</a> Apple may be looking to leverage its software and chip design expertise to create a kind of next-generation vehicle platform for other manufacturers to use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> in January <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-launch-5-to-7-years-away/\">reported</a> that Apple self-driving vehicle is still in early development and is still at least five years away, while reliable Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes that the vehicle is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/27/kuo-apple-car-2025-2027-at-earliest/\">unlikely to launch until 2025 at the earliest</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-car-loses-several-top-managers/\">lost</a> \"several\" top managers from its internal ‌Apple Car‌ project, codenamed \"Project Titan,\" causing a potential setback to the launch of a self-driving car.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/apple-in-early-talks-chinese-battery-makers-car/\">Apple in 'Early-Stage' Talks With Chinese EV Battery Makers for Apple Car</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-in-early-stage-talks-with-chinese-ev-battery-makers-for-apple-car.2299808/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1x5B0Kk7TBs:f_MOHqT-Deo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1x5B0Kk7TBs:f_MOHqT-Deo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1x5B0Kk7TBs\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23c708e8cbab9620e44ce074c72747c879989b31c8c0307e2dde9a05efd515a8","category":"Apple"}
