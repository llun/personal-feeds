The Snapdragon 480 is an 8 nm chip, with two 2 GHz Arm Cortex A76 CPUs and six 1.8 Ghz Cortex A55 CPUs. This is Qualcomm's first low-end SoC to support 5G, if that does anything for you, and there's even an option (though Nokia did not exercise it on the X20) for mmWave antennas. More importantly, Qualcomm says the CPU and GPU should be twice as fast as the old Snapdragon 460.</p>\n<p>The other big news of the day is that Nokia is extending support to three years now, with three years of major OS updates and three years of monthly security updates. Previously, the company was doing two years of major updates.
