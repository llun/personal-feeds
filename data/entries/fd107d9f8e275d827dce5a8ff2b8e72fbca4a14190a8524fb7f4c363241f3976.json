New leaks and speculation are suggesting that Apple may launch its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334279/apple-silicon-macs-may-be-a-reboot-of-the-g4-cube-and-colorful-imac-g3.html\">new Apple silicon iMac</a> at the event as well, marking the iconic all-in-one’s first redesign in nearly 15 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It started with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343414/this-apple-spring-loaded-invite-theory-is-kinda-blowing-our-mind.html\">a wild theory</a> that the spiral Apple logo in the even invitation was actually a play on the original Mac’s “hello” screen. We were appropriately blown away by the suggestion, but didn’t really think it was anything more than a coincidence or perhaps a wink from Apple’s graphic design team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now we’re thinking it might be something greater than an Easter egg. On Saturday, occasional but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/L0vetodream&amp;xcust=1-1-343589-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">often accurate leaker l0vetodream</a> posted a thinly veiled reference to a new iMac on their Twitter account. The tweet consists of little more than a thinking face emoji with two images: the Apple logo from the “Spring Loaded” invitation and the strawberry, lime, and tangerine <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/190458/original_imac.html\">iMac G3</a>. There was no follow-up, but l0vetodream previously tweeted on April 3 that “The ‌iMac‌’s screen is really big, bigger than the biggest one.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>🧐 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/D2kgGH7T1l&amp;xcust=1-1-343589-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/D2kgGH7T1l</a></p>— 有没有搞措 (@L0vetodream) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/L0vetodream/status/1383349327658057728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-343589-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that none of the credible leakers have specifically weighed in on whether the iMac is coming at this event. In an interview late last week, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6lGR6xDmwk#038;feature=youtu.be&amp;xcust=1-1-343237-0-0-0%7Cxid:fr1618710492402che&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/343237/apple-spring-loaded-april-2021-event-ipad-pro-airtags-airpods-apple-tv-imac-2.html\">Mark Gurman from Bloomberg said in an interview</a> that “if the iMac does indeed get launched next week, that’s gonna be a big deal,” but stopped short of confirming or denying its arrival. The launch of an iMac would make sense at a spring event, leaving room for new MacBook Pro models at WWDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/imac-colors-rumors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption><p>The Apple silicon iMac, which is rumored to come in a variety of colors, might be unveiled on Tuesday.</p> </figcaption></figure><p>Jon Prosser/FPT</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with a new Apple silicon processor, the iMac is widely expected to get a bigger screen with slimmer bezels and a dramatic redesign that mirrors the minimal look of the Pro Display XDR. It’s also rumored to be available in an array of new colors similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234771/ipad-air-2020-review.html\">iPad Air</a>, which is available in blue, green, pink, silver, and space gray.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spanish-spring-loaded-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the speculation is the tagline Apple used in the invitation sent out to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/369403&amp;xcust=1-1-343589-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">members of the press in Spain</a>. Instead of “Spring Loaded,” the tagline reads “Novedades de todos los colores,” which translates into “New in all colors.” Now, that <em>could</em> be a reference to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/235002/ipad-pro-mini-led-display.html\">the iPad Pro’s new mini LED display</a> or new Apple Watch bands that are supposedly on the way, but with the rest of the rumors, it certainly seems like new iMacs are on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343237/apple-spring-loaded-april-2021-event-ipad-pro-airtags-airpods-apple-tv-imac-2.html\">Apple’s “Spring Loaded” event</a> will be held on Tuesday at 10 am PT.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fd107d9f8e275d827dce5a8ff2b8e72fbca4a14190a8524fb7f4c363241f3976","category":"Apple"}
