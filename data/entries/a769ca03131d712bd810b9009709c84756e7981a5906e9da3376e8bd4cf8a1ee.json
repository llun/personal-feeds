Then it was reported that Sam Bennett got the all clear. Now, Deceuninck-QuickStep has announced its squad for the Tour. Mark Cavendish is in.</p>\n<p>That's right, the Manx Missile, former green jersey winner, 30-time stage winner has been named as part of Patrick Lefevere's star-studded lineup.</p>\n<p>It will be Cavendish's first appearance at the Tour since 2018 when he was with Team Dimension Data and while it's unlikely he'll get the four wins required to level Eddy Merckx's record for most Tour de France stage wins, there are certainly opportunities to add to his tally.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mark Cavendish to race the Tour de France for Deceuninck-QuickStep.<br /><br />Chapeau <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkCavendish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MarkCavendish</a>, what a comeback story.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tdf2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tdf2021</a><a href=\"https://t.co/YeO0gVInEh\">pic.twitter.com/YeO0gVInEh</a></p>\n<p>— Cyclist (@cyclist) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclist/status/1406965305168044037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>He'll be racing alongside World Champion Julian Alaphilippe, Tour of Flanders winner Kasper Asgreen and Omloop Het Nieuwsblad victor Davide Ballerini as well as <em>El Tractor</em> Tim Declercq, the experienced Dries Devenyns and Michael Mørkøv and the in-form Mattia Cattaneo.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9457/nacer-bouhanni-shares-examples-of-racist-abuse-hes-received-on-social-media\">Nacer Bouhanni shares examples of racist abuse he's received on social media</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6723/health-mate-cuts-sponsorship-ties-with-van-gansen-amid-abuse-allegations\">Health Mate cuts sponsorship ties with Van Gansen amid abuse allegations</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9459/brace-for-impact-pro-cyclists-on-the-uci-s-new-safety-rules\">Brace for impact: pro cyclists on the UCI’s new safety rules</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 115: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nSince he returned to the team at the start of the season, Cavendish has had a return to form, winning four stage of the Tour of Turkey and outsprinting a wealth of the world's top talent at Baloise Belgium Tour including some of his soon-to-be Tour competitors like Caleb Ewan, Tim Merlier, Nacer Bouhanni and Bryan Coquard.</p>\n<p>While he's clearly not in his prime anymore at 36 years old, it would be foolish to write off Cav's chances at a stage win. The form, the experience and the desire are there for all to see. Call it a comeback. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a769ca03131d712bd810b9009709c84756e7981a5906e9da3376e8bd4cf8a1ee","category":"Cycling"}
