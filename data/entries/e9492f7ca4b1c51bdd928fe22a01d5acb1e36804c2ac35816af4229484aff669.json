{"title":"New Apple Pencil Allegedly Leaks With Glossy Finish and Redesigned Tip","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/","date":1614781062000,"content":"Images supposedly depicting a third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> have been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laobaiTD/status/1367102458124660745?s=20\">shared on Twitter</a> by the leaker known as \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/laobaiTD\">Mr. White</a>.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/apple-pencil-3-leak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786565\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe purported new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; appears to share a very similar design to the current, second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, which is shorter than the previous version and charges inductively on the side of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe updated &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; appears to have a glossy finish, much like that used on the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, rather than the matte white finish used on the second version of the accessory.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe other notable difference is the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;'s tip. The first and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; have small, screw-on tips that are able to be easily replaced when worn out. This updated model seems to have a considerably larger tip component, with a much longer section that screws into the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; itself. It is unclear why a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; may have a redesigned tip, but it is likely indicative of internal design changes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe redesigned head may signal that new functionality is coming to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;'s tip. In July last year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/\">applied for a patent</a> regarding an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that would allow the device to sample colors from the real world via a color sensor, so it is clear that Apple is interested in expanding the utility of its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; stylus.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll in all, the image suggests that the new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;'s upgrades may be more focused on the internals of the accessory rather than any significant external design changes. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to expect some added functionality over the current model to justify a new iteration of the device.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"Mr. White\" has previously leaked correct <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/08/alleged-ipad-mini-5-photos/\">images of the iPad mini 5</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/iphone-12-pro-rear-glass-photo-shows-lidar-scanner/\">back glass of the Graphite iPhone 12 Pro</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/supposed-iphone-12-display-unit-leaks/\">iPhone 12 mini's display</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/a14-chip-component-iphone-12/\">A14 chip components</a>. Other leaks, such as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/24/leaked-iphone-12-braided-usb-c-to-lightning-cable/\">braided Lightning cable</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/02/future-apple-pencil-black-color/\">black Apple Pencil color option</a>, have not yet emerged, but overall \"Mr. White\" does seem to have a reliable track record.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is also important to note that new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/prosser-airtags-ipad-pro-next-month/\">expected to arrive this month</a>, so the timeframe of this leak may add to its reliability. The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/low-cost-ipad-thinner-design/\">upgraded A-series chips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/kuo-ipad-mini-led-airpods-3-coming-1h21/\">mini-LED displays</a>, all in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/12/leaked-2021-ipad-pro-images-few-changes/\">largely unchanged design</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mr-white/\">Mr. White</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/\">New Apple Pencil Allegedly Leaks With Glossy Finish and Redesigned Tip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks-with-glossy-finish-and-redesigned-tip.2286901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hGd_fqWXQYI:0H5q_y-CnXE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hGd_fqWXQYI:0H5q_y-CnXE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hGd_fqWXQYI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e9492f7ca4b1c51bdd928fe22a01d5acb1e36804c2ac35816af4229484aff669","category":"Apple"}
