But while most companies, organisations, and institutions are looking to cut costs, Wimbledon has stuck to its mantra. Don't do things cheaper; do things <em>better</em>.</p>\n<p>Case in point: Wimbledon's use of technology is really quite impressive. I've been lucky enough to follow Wimbledon's tech <a href=\"https://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2015/07/exploring-the-ibm-bunker-the-brain-of-wimbledon/\">over the last three years</a>, and it has been very encouraging to see a massive endeavour like The Championships dive deeper and deeper into technology. You might think that after 140 years Wimbledon could be stuck in its ways, but far from it. When technology is the only viable way of providing consistent, significant gains for players, visitors, and hundreds of millions of people spectating remotely, you don't try to fight it; you embrace it.</p>\n<p>Of course, Wimbledon is embracing tech in a distinctly Wimbledon way. This year, for example, The Championships are trialling free Wi-Fi—but because they don't yet know how people will behave with free Wi-Fi, it's only available in three specific locations (near the food court, in the ticket resale area, and on the west side of court 12). The tournament continues through this weekend, but its team has already started analysing the data. It turns out that, thankfully, the Wi-Fi users on court 12 only use their phones between points. When play begins, Wi-Fi usage stops. If the trial is a success, Wi-Fi could be rolled out across Wimbledon in 2018.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1131697#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1131697&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sebastian Anthony","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"900f5db6a23e4dfc86b5746a71b362c229bf1e0b5fa51ff77584cab16a4b5531","category":"Tech"}
