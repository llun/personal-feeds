The report doesn't specify which ‌iPad‌ models would make the switch from LCD to OLED technology, but credible Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has reported that the mid-range <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-oled-ipad-air-in-2022/\">updated with an OLED display next year</a> at a minimum.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple currently uses OLED displays for higher-end iPhones and all Apple Watch models, while the remaining product families continue to use LCD technology. OLED displays in Apple products are currently supplied by Samsung and LG, and <em>ETNews</em> believes that the two suppliers will also provide OLED displays for future iPads.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, Apple introduced a brand new 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with mini-LED technology, which, compared to LCD, offers deeper blacks, improved contrast, and higher brightness. Apple is expected to continue the adoption of mini-LED display technology with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/31/mini-led-macbook-pro-third-quarter-shipments/\">new models of the MacBook Pro</a> as early as this year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/31/ipad-models-with-oled-next-year/\">Apple Rumored to Adopt OLED Displays in 'Some' iPad Models Starting Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rumored-to-adopt-oled-displays-in-some-ipad-models-starting-next-year.2298647/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ywm8_UjOimk:aD-gZjEqSFQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ywm8_UjOimk:aD-gZjEqSFQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ywm8_UjOimk\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b350d03bab90fef26dbbf58ead524eeac3646bea473789ab903e3db7591bab8f","category":"Apple"}
