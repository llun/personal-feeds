It is part of its history. This is why we are pleased to announce that the Queen of the Classics will return in 2021 and that the competitors of the first ever women's edition will also discover its legendary route.'</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9435/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no1-digital-editor-joes-ride-around-kent\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No1: Digital editor Joe&#039;s ride around Kent</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nMeanwhile UCI president David Lappartient said, 'For the UCI and the cycling community, it was very important that both races could take place in 2021, and I am delighted that new dates suitable for all parties have been found. </p>\n<p>'It was essential to find, together with all parties concerned, an appropriate postponement date, in keeping with the status of this mythical event so much appreciated by riders and fans, and whose female riders are looking forward to competing in the inaugural women's edition.'</p>\n<p>The new dates mean that the best race on the cycling calendar is now due to go ahead just a week after the UCI Road World Championships races, which are being held this year in Flanders, so we'll still get our Flanders/Roubaix double of sorts. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"509f00b78aac73fe13a7cf6cec3738b38aa78358cb5446eecba06f2592f37289","category":"Cycling"}
