However, the timeline from known samples and other indicators mentioned below suggest that other XcodeSpy projects may exist. By sharing details of this campaign, we hope to raise awareness of this attack vector and highlight the fact that developers are high-value targets for attackers.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\nSentinelOne says that all Apple Developers that use Xcode should exercise caution when using shared Xcode projects.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xcode/\">Xcode</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/xcodespy-malware-targeting-apple-developers/\">Security Researchers Discover XcodeSpy Malware That Targets Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-researchers-discover-xcodespy-malware-that-targets-developers.2288805/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v9DeJs9zNEw:qSIWhcbck0g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v9DeJs9zNEw:qSIWhcbck0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/v9DeJs9zNEw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"09ad13c033982f164ed6e6a5b495ee0a9da757057bbd0558878c20b9195de23e","category":"Apple"}
