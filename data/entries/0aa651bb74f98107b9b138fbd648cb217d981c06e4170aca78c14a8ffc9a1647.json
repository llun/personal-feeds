Seeing as this is Florida, which (obviously) is a place where Disney has some clout — and Disney has famously powerful lobbyists all over the damn place — it appears that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamkovac/status/1387964060948443140\">Disney made sure the Florida legislature gave them a carveout</a>. Florida Senator Ray Rodriques <a href=\"https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/7072/Amendment/811008/HTML\">introduced an amendment to the bill</a>, which got included in the final vote.

Florida, along with other Republican-led states, recently passed a law that prohibits companies from banning guns in their parking lots. The Florida version of the law has a unique provision: <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2008-07-03-disneyguns03-story.html\">an exception for companies that store “explosives”, including fireworks</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/01/disney-florida-carveout\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0aa651bb74f98107b9b138fbd648cb217d981c06e4170aca78c14a8ffc9a1647","category":"Tech"}
