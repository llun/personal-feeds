The larger size of this bulb is necessitated by the need for additional passive cooling measures as the LED produces more heat when emitting more light.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/Philips-Hue-White-and-Color-1100-und-1600-Lumen.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, Philips Hue is seeking to expand its filament range of bulbs by introducing new E27 filament shapes in the White Ambiance range, with a maximum brightness of 550 lumens. There will also be a brand new E14 Hue White filament bulb for the European market, which will become the smallest filament lamp in the range.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/Hue-White-Ambiance-Filament-alle-Lampen.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>hueblog.com</em>, the new products will be officially unveiled at the end of August or the beginning of September.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nElsewhere, the company is said to be exploring new Hue products with its Gradient lighting technology. This enables the output of several colors simultaneously and has so far only been available with its Gradient Lightstrip.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/\">Philips Hue</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/philips-hue-to-launch-brighter-bulbs-and-expand-filament-range/\">Philips Hue to Launch Brighter Bulbs and Expand Filament Range</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-to-launch-brighter-bulbs-and-expand-filament-range.2302926/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bdQYkGKfSho:8umX6Z6dcDw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bdQYkGKfSho:8umX6Z6dcDw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bdQYkGKfSho\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0bd275c399ef70b1880a36ed1a9fb27efec7c880b07c0690aae81f25e2bfac14","category":"Apple"}
