The Jumbo-Visma pursuers were able to bring the gap back down under a minute, but further crashes in the peloton in the last several kilometers made for slow going at parts, and Roglic’s group was further distanced as the pace reached its maximum with the sprint teams lining up in the finale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič would ultimately arrive 1:21 down on stage winner Tim Merlier (Alpecin-Fenix), putting him at the same deficit behind Richard Carapaz (Ineos Grenadiers), the best-placed GC star on the day. The 2020 Tour runner-up would cede less time to last year’s Tour winner and a few other GC rivals, as Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) and Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) finished 26 seconds down on the day, and thus 55 seconds ahead of Roglič.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo-Visma said after the stages that medical checks had determined that Roglič had not suffered any broken bones in the crash, though it remains to be seen how the scrapes and bruises he did sustain in the fall will affect him moving forward.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/primoz-roglic-loses-time-after-taking-a-hard-fall-on-stage-3-of-the-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"494219b52d24d206faf6df1866f0a2195556aa63e8ee1e16dbb9fb824b72cf58","category":"Cycling"}
