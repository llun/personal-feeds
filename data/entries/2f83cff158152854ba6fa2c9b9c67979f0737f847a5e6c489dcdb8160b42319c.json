Even when an AirTag-affixed item is lost in a far away place, its location can be anonymously pinpointed by other Apple device users, as part of the crowdsourced Find My network.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are waiting for your AirTag order to arrive, be sure to <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232/\">discuss in our forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/airtag-unboxing-videos/\">watch our roundup of unboxing videos</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/airtag-orders-shipped/\">AirTag Orders Moving to 'Shipped' Status for More Customers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-orders-moving-to-shipped-status-for-more-customers.2293879/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=G-fLSZsQ9ig:LZokQWJ-DHs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=G-fLSZsQ9ig:LZokQWJ-DHs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/G-fLSZsQ9ig\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2f83cff158152854ba6fa2c9b9c67979f0737f847a5e6c489dcdb8160b42319c","category":"Apple"}
