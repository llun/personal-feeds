{"title":"Bikes of Unbound Gravel: Amity Rockwell’s Pinarello Grevil","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/bikes-of-unbound-gravel-amity-rockwells-pinarello-grevil/","date":1622876855000,"content":"<p>Everything about Amity Rockwell’s Unbound Gravel race rig is new. When she won Unbound Gravel in 2019, she did it on board an Allied Able. Now she’s sponsored by Pinarello, so she gets the chance to defend her crown aboard some svelte Italian craftsmanship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Rockwell if she felt any extra pressure being the reigning champion with the absence of the race last year during the pandemic. But she seemed unfazed; she had appeared on the scene quite abruptly, and in turn, racing shut down rather abruptly. If Rockwell is able to repeat her 2019 success, however, the attention and notoriety will likely be a lot harder to miss. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rockwell’s Grevil is outfitted with an 11-speed Shimano Frankenstein drivetrain; she runs Easton EC90SL cranks with a 40-tooth chainring, a Shimano GRX rear derailleur with oversize Kogel pulley system, and Shimano Ultegra Di2 shifter/brake levers. Rockwell says she prefers the shape of the Ultegra levers over GRX, and the Kogel pulley system helps reduce drivetrain friction. Every little bit helps over 200 miles of Kansas gravel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Rockwell spent time training on Wahoo/Speedplay pedals, she has switched over to Shimano XTR SPDs for her Unbound battle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while she was hesitant at first to replace her beloved Schwalbe G-One Allroad tires, Rockwell says she’s a big fan of the brand new <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/schwalbe-announces-new-g-one-r-gravel-tyres/\" target=\"_blank\">G-One R tires</a>, which combine durability with a supple ride feel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the rest of Rockwell’s Pinarello Grevil build below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Amity-Rockwell-Pinarello-Grevil-Unbound-race-bike-cyclingtips-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Amity Rockwell will line up for the 200-mile gravel event onboard a Pinarello Grevil. <br /><br /> </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Amity-Rockwell-Pinarello-Grevil-Unbound-race-bike-cyclingtips-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Pinarello offers both the Grevil + and Grevil. Both bikes share the same mould but the “+” version features a higher modulus carbon construction.
