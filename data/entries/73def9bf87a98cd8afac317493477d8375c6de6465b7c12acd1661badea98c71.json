When asked what was the youngest age group that might be authorized for the vaccine by September, he said, “I would think by the time we get to school opening, we likely will be able to get people who come into the first grade.”</p>\n<p>As optimistic as Fauci is, several pediatricians and infectious disease experts said they wish the pediatric trials would move more quickly. In addition to restoring stability to the education system and parents’ work schedules and keeping kids and those around them safe, vaccinating children is essential to helping the country, as a whole, reach herd immunity and decrease the threat of new variants.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741416#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741416&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73def9bf87a98cd8afac317493477d8375c6de6465b7c12acd1661badea98c71","category":"Tech"}
