{"title":"Rancher Uses Apple Watch to Find iPhone 12 in a Haystack in Apple's Latest Ad","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/apple-haystack-iphone-12-ad/","date":1625839017000,"content":"Apple today <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXKu9qTmA2M\">shared a new ad</a> called \"Haystack\" in which a rancher uses his Apple Watch to find his iPhone 12 in a haystack. The ad plays on the \"needle in a haystack\" idiom and is set to the song \"Searching (For Someone Like You)\" by country singer Kitty Wells.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the one-minute ad, a rancher drives down a rural street surrounded by bales of hay. He then backs up his truck off the street, walks with his dog to a large haystack, and taps on a button in the Apple Watch's Control Center to ping his iPhone, which results in the iPhone playing a sound to help pinpoint its location if misplaced nearby.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"An iPhone that's lost is easily found,\" says Apple. \"Relax, it's iPhone + Apple Watch.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo use this feature on the Apple Watch, swipe up to open Control Center and tap the Ping iPhone button, which will make the device chime. You can also touch and hold the Ping iPhone button to make the iPhone flash as well.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, if your iPhone isn't in range of your Apple Watch, you can track its location using the Find My app on another Apple device or iCloud.com.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/apple-haystack-iphone-12-ad/\">Rancher Uses Apple Watch to Find iPhone 12 in a Haystack in Apple's Latest Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rancher-uses-apple-watch-to-find-iphone-12-in-a-haystack-in-apples-latest-ad.2303731/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tESNtubh7ks:IDv6RHDC5Pw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tESNtubh7ks:IDv6RHDC5Pw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/tESNtubh7ks\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4304494718d094bc516bbea7d1559d61d095502522fc7d1734efa5648336330","category":"Apple"}
