Apple says the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/04/new-27-inch-imac-10th-gen-intel/\">latest 27-inch iMac introduced in August</a> is the preferred choice for the vast majority of pro iMac users, and said customers who need even more performance and expandability can choose the Mac Pro.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe latest 27-inch iMac features a 5K display with True Tone and a nano-texture glass option, up to a 10-core 10th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, up to 128GB of RAM, up to 8TB of storage, up to AMD Radeon Pro 5700 XT graphics, a 10 Gigabit Ethernet option, a higher-resolution 1080p camera, improved speakers and microphones, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile the Intel-based 27-inch iMac is Apple's recommendation right now, rumors suggest that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/\">redesigned iMac</a> with a next-generation Apple silicon chip and a design inspired by Apple's high-end Pro Display XDR will be released later this year, so many customers may want to exercise patience. It's unclear if an Apple silicon version of the iMac Pro will ever be released, but it appears unlikely at this point.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nReleased in December 2017, the iMac Pro received no substantial hardware refreshes over its lifetime.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac-pro/\">iMac Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac_Pro\">iMac Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/06/apple-confirms-imac-pro-will-be-discontinued/\">Apple Confirms iMac Pro Will Be Discontinued When Supplies Run Out, Recommends 27-Inch iMac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-imac-pro-will-be-discontinued-when-supplies-run-out-recommends-27-inch-imac.2287322/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n-p1Wl82EvM:48iY3cEaj7c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n-p1Wl82EvM:48iY3cEaj7c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/n-p1Wl82EvM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43cec9d257695b3471a7bb9c88bffa054b67c025a32cca2c93ddf95f336bdc85","category":"Apple"}
