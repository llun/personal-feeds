The iPhone accessory is a new product category for Apple, building on its Find My network. While AirTags won't be in the hands of customers until next week, we continue to learn more about Apple's latest gadget.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nYouTuber Rene Ritchie <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DEbm2iG1TNU\">had a chance</a> to speak to Apple's VP of iPhone worldwide marketing, Kaiann Drance, and Apple's senior director of sensing and connectivity, Ron Huang, to discuss AirTags, its features, design, and privacy. The interview covers much of the same ground as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/airtags-for-items-not-pets-children/\">another interview the executives gave</a> to <em>Fast Company</em>, but it does include a few other notable tidbits.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Maximum of 16 AirTags Connected to A Single Apple ID</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nApple will offer a single AirTag for $29 and a pack of four for $99. Most customers will want to track their keys, wallets, and backpack, not needing more than four. The maximum number of AirTags that can be connected to a single Apple ID is 16, according to Apple's Kaiann Drance. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3> Low Battery Notfication</h3>\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/airtag-water-rating-battery-life/\">AirTags feature a replaceable coin-cell battery</a> that, according to Apple, can last as long as a year. AirTags don't have a screen, or a light, making it hard to understand if the battery is low and needs replacing. As revealed in Ritchieâ€™s interview, iPhone will alert users once the AirTags battery is starting to run low. It's still not clear which specific threshold the battery must reach before an alert is sent. Still, it can reasonably be assumed the AirTag would have enough battery left to allow the owner to purchase and replace it before it completely dies.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Sharing AirTags With Friends and Family</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nIn some instances, users may want to share their car key with a friend or family member, which happens to have an AirTag attached to it. In normal cases, the AirTags safety feature would kick in, alerting the person that an unknown tracking device is on them. Apple's way to prevent this is through Family Sharing. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs Kaiann Drance explains, if an AirTag is being shared with an Apple ID within Family Sharing, the owner of the AirTag can disable the safety alerts to prevent their family or friends iPhone from detecting it as unwanted tracking.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn cases where an AirTag is being borrowed by an individual not in Family Sharing, the borrower can choose to disable the safety alerts.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirTags will be available for pre-order on Friday, April 23, and will begin shipping on April 30.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/airtag-tidbits-maximum-per-apple-id-battery-more/\">AirTag Tidbits: Maximum of 16 Per Apple ID, Low Battery Notifications on iPhone, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-tidbits-maximum-of-16-per-apple-id-low-battery-notifications-on-iphone-and-more.2292780/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IX74klZBCXs:6ADiiYv72sg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IX74klZBCXs:6ADiiYv72sg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/IX74klZBCXs\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aacfd2529aad4d1973f3c0c7a313baf9c8832e0d5a398103e60bb8e3c958181f","category":"Apple"}
