In late 2017 and early 2018, McAfee urged his hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers to invest in a number of obscure cryptocurrencies. Prosecutors say he failed to disclose his own financial stake in those tokensâ€”and in some cases outright lied about it.</p>\n<p>McAfee has been in custody in Spain since his <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/john-mcafee-arrested-indicted-on-tax-evasion-charges-sued-for-fraud/\">arrest at a Barcelona airport</a> last October. He was already facing extradition to the United States on tax evasion charges; the self-described Libertarian hasn't filed a tax return for several years. Now he will face additional charges of securities and wire fraud alongside bodyguard Jimmy Watson, who allegedly helped McAfee carry out some of his pump-and-dump schemes.</p>\n<p>The criminal complaint covers much of the same ground as a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-246\">civil lawsuit</a> filed by the Securities and Exchange commission at the time of his arrest last October.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747507#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747507&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
