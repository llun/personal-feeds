The breakaway specialists may sense an opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\"><b><i>Tour de France 2021 Guide</i></b></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tagged/tour-de-france-2021\"><b><i>Tour de France 2021 articles</i></b></a></p>\n<div></div>\n<h4><b>Route</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_PROFILS_ETAPES_SANS_RAVITO_ETP12_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625579886\" />Stage 12 profile </span></i></p>\n<p><span><span>The opening 20km are flat a</span>fter stage 12 kicks-off in <span>Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux.</span> A breakaway may form here, though the first climb at kilometre 27 provides the best chance for the group of <span>escapees </span>to form. The Combe du Pouzat is uncategorised but averages around 3% for 4km.</span></p>\n<p><span>The following kilometres take place on rolling terrain with continuous bumps and lumps to be tackled. This leads into the first and only categorised climb of the stage. The Côte du Belvédère de Tharaux begins 79km in. Two points lie at the top which means the leader of the KOM classification can rest in the peloton throughout the stage.</span></p>\n<p><span>The next point of note is the intermediate sprint which occurs in <span>Uzès.</span></span><span> Crucially, the sprint takes place just 27km from the finish in </span><span>Nîmes. which may deter some sprinters from expending pivotal energy with another uphill section to come.</span></p>\n<p><span>With just 16.4km remaining, there is an uncategorised effort which is 3.9km in length. Although it is only around 3% on average, some of the pure sprinters may be unable to resist the tempo.</span></p>\n<p><span>After this, the riders will descend swiftly into Nîmes which they enter with 5.8km left. The sprint teams must stay aware as with just over 2km remaining there is an important left turn. </span><span>The road is narrow here which makes positioning even more important. However,</span><span> the major moment in the final kilometres is a 90-degree right-hander with approximately 800 metres to go. Positioning here is pivotal. The road widens afterwards, and a large roundabout with just 300 metres left is the final obstacle. A technical finish means the eventual winner must be positioned well throughout.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1233799611-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625579855\" />Image credit: THOMAS SAMSON/AFP via Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Caleb Ewan, Tim Merlier and Arnaud <span>Démare </span>have all left the Tour de France, meaning the sprinting field is heavily depleted. This opening will entice the remaining sprinters.</span></p>\n<p><span>This stage has </span><b>Peter Sagan</b><span>’s name written all over it. Bora-hansgrohe put on a masterclass at the Giro d’Italia earlier this season when they dropped their closest rivals on the hills before leading Sagan to victory in Foligno. The German outfit may employ a similar tactic here. </span></p>\n<p><span>The third category </span><span>Côte du Belvédère de Tharaux could be the building block for them to kick on, but they may even wait for the final hill just before </span><span>Nîmes. This strategy is riskier as the climb isn’t as demanding, therefore Cavendish has a greater chance of holding on. Conversely, this strategy means Bora</span><span> would spend fewer resources </span><span>as this section is much closer to the finish line.</span></p>\n<p>Bora will not be alone in their wishes to push Cavendish out the back, particularly after the Manx Missile won his third Tour stage this year in Valence. Team BikeExchange and Bahrain - Victorious could well join Bora on the front to work for their respective leaders, <b>Michael Matthews </b><span>and </span><b>Sonny Colbrelli</b><span>. Although both are fast finishers, they are also capable climbers so won’t mind a hasty rhythm when the road punches uphill. They must remove Mark Cavendish from the equation if they are to challenge for his green jersey.</span></p>\n<p><span>It would take a valiant performance from </span><b>Mark Cavendish </b><span>to resist the hills and remain in the peloton, let alone win the stage in a mass-sprint. Nonetheless, he must be Deceuninck’s first option. If he is there, he’ll be almost impossible to stop. However, Deceuninck have a great second option in the form of </span><b>Davide Ballerini</b><span>. Ballerini has displayed climbing skills before, notably at the Tour de la Provence where he sprinted to victory after a difficult uphill finish in <span>Manosque</span>. He hasn't been on top form at the Tour de France just yet, but if Cavendish is dropped, watch out for Ballerini.</span></p>\n<p><span>Mathieu van der Poel and Tim Merlier have both left the Tour de France, which means </span><b>Jasper Philipsen</b><span> is the out and out leader for Alpecin-Fenix. He will get the chance here, though his leadout train has now been decimated. This makes the job of the remaining </span><b>Jonas Rickaert </b><span>and </span><b>Silvan Dillier</b><span> even more important.</span></p>\n<p><span>France entered the Tour de France with various hopes in the sprints including Bryan Coquard and Arnaud <span>Démare</span>. Both were over the time limit on stage 9 though, which means the best French sprinter left is </span><b>Nacer Bouhanni</b><span>. The Arkea-Samsic rider has already recorded three podium finishes</span><span> at the 2021 Tour, but he is still searching for his first stage victory at his home Grand Tour.</span></p>\n<p><b>Alex Aranburu</b><span> and </span><b>Magnus Cort</b><span> are two fast men that could challenge in a reduced sprint, but may consider their best opportunity to lie in the breakaway.</span></p>\n<p><span>With plenty of rolling terrain which will make the race more difficult to control, the breakaway may fancy their chances on stage 12. Depending on when and in what shape the breakaway forms, they just might be able to hold off the chasers.</span></p>\n<p><span>Many of the classics specialists could seek stage victory from the break, namely </span><b>Oliver Naesen, Greg Van Avermaet, Stefan Küng, Jasper Stuyven </b><span>and </span><b>Søren Kragh Andersen.</b></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"b557a425dc0d4c08bb727ab3d34a62d94185197e01cdf33e65645d16696fa01a","category":"Cycling"}
