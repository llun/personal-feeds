Note that the iPhones come from various third-party suppliers and are not necessarily provided direct by Amazon.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787846\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAmazon has two product grades: Renewed and Renewed Premium. Renewed is the cheapest option and starts at &#36;170 for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 with 64GB storage, while Renewed Premium is a bit more expensive. It's worth noting that prices on Renewed and Renewed Premium devices do fluctuate, and sometimes the Premium versions go out of stock. Apple doesn't offer a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 anymore, but for comparison's sake, charges &#36;339 for a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-8\">Refurbished version</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone-checklist.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787847\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAmazon says that its Renewed devices have no \"visible cosmetic imperfections\" when held at an arm's length and a battery capacity that exceeds 80 percent relative to a new device, while Renewed Premium versions are \"certified to work and look like new,\" so we chose the Premium option to get as close as possible to new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 that we received from Amazon looks and feels like a new device, but it did ship with a non-factory charger and Lightning cable. There were a few hairline scratches on the screen that weren't super noticeable, but will likely annoy perfectionists.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amazon-refurbished-iphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787848\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter charging, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 worked as expected and had a 90 percent battery capacity. Over the course of a few days of usage, we ran into an issue with the speaker. At loud volumes, it sounds off with a noticeable crackling, which was not a problem with an original launch day &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 that we had on hand. The speaker issue did not impact call quality, so the phone was functional even with this problem.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amazon-renewed-certificate.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787849\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you're looking for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; on the cheap, Amazon's Renewed devices are worth checking out, but don't expect total perfection. We ran into some minor problems, and if you check out the Amazon reviews, other users have also had more significant issues with the used and refurbished iPhones that they've purchased from Amazon.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAmazon offers a 90-day return policy for Renewed devices, while \"Premium\" versions come with a one-year customer satisfaction guarantee with an option to return the product, so if something is wrong with a device, you can send it back and get a refund.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/amazon-renewed-iphone/\">Should You Buy a Super Cheap Refurbished iPhone From Amazon?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/should-you-buy-a-super-cheap-refurbished-iphone-from-amazon.2287704/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7E3UO893xeU:eSoFyQtN-zc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7E3UO893xeU:eSoFyQtN-zc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7E3UO893xeU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb1e39d6750dba271c24922573b69e470054569cd13a170cd945d2069d0be561","category":"Apple"}
