I believe that as long as your electricity is clean and your battery has enough range to get you where you're going (with the occasional DC fast-charge for a longer trip), even the least efficient EV <a href=\"https://www.carboncounter.com/#!/explore\">will beat anything with an internal combustion engine</a>—particularly if that EV replaces something inefficient like a sports car or a big SUV. Most people think this idea isn't enough, though, and whoever can go the farthest on the fewest kWh wins.</p>\n<p>As of Thursday, there's a new winner. A British veterans nonprofit called Mission Motorsport spent 24 hours driving a pair of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/renault-zoe-r90-ze-40-review/\">Renault Zoes</a> (with 52 kWh battery packs) around the Thruxton racetrack in England. The 2.4-mile (3.8-km) circuit is <a href=\"https://www.btcc.net/calendar/thruxton/\">one of the UK's fastest</a>, but the record-setting Zoe averaged around 19 mph (30.5 km/h). That was good for 475.4 miles (765 km) on a single charge, which works out to be 9.14 miles/kWh (14.71 km/kWh).</p>\n<p>The winning Zoe was entirely standard, except for a set of tires developed by a company called Enso. The second Zoe ran on its factory-fitted rubber and still managed 424.7 miles. That's a lot better than the car's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure\">WLTP</a> range of 245 miles (394 km) and works out to an efficiency of 8.16 miles/kWh (13.13 km/kWh).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772460#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772460&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
