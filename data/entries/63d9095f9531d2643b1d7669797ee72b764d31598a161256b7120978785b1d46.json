All four worked in Ive's group at Apple and now list LoveFrom as an employer on LinkedIn.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWan worked on app icons, buttons, and home screens as part of Apple's human interface team, which Wilson was also a part of. Wilson helped design the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> icon and the Apple Watch user interface. Tiller worked on administrative matters on the design team, while Kessler worked on the Force Touch trackpad for the MacBook before leaving Apple in 2017.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIve <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-leaving-apple/\">left Apple</a> to begin LoveFrom in 2019, but the design firm has kept a low profile. There is no website and it is unclear how many employees work for Ive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt the time that Ive left Apple, Apple said that Ive would continue to work with the company on exclusive projects, with Apple to serve as one of LoveFrom's clients. Ive was, for example, involved with the creation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/29/jony-ive-involved-in-24-imac/\">of the 2021 iMac</a>. LoveFrom has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/jony-ive-lovefrom-airbnb-partnership/\">worked with</a> companies like Airbnb. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lovefrom/\">LoveFrom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/jony-ive-lovefrom-recruits-former-apple-designers/\">Jony Ive Recruited Four Former Apple Design Colleagues to 'LoveFrom'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-recruited-four-former-apple-design-colleagues-to-lovefrom.2299102/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fFfbXW_V5hw:ihT6B_UWUXU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fFfbXW_V5hw:ihT6B_UWUXU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fFfbXW_V5hw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"63d9095f9531d2643b1d7669797ee72b764d31598a161256b7120978785b1d46","category":"Apple"}
