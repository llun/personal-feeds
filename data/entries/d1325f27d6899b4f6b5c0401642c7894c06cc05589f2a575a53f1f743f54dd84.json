{"title":"Protecting Reputations","link":"https://pxlnv.com/blog/private-exploit-marketplaces/","date":1618849006000,"content":"\n<p>Nick Heer, quoting from and commenting upon a line from the aforelinked Washington Post story on how the FBI cracked the San Bernardino iPhone in 2016:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n  <p>Apple has a tense relationship with security research firms.\nWilder said the company believes researchers should disclose all\nvulnerabilities to Apple so that the company can more quickly\nfix them. Doing so would help preserve its reputation as having\nsecure devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a bizarre turn of phrase. It would help it “preserve its\nreputation as having secure devices” because it really would help\nimprove the security of its devices for all users, in much the\nsame way that telling a fire department that there is a fire\nnearby would help a building’s reputation as a fire-free zone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a little thing, but this hyper-cynical slant is pervasive in a lot of recent mainstream coverage of the big tech companies. It’s hard to find a Reed Albergotti-bylined story in the Post without it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/protecting-reputations\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d1325f27d6899b4f6b5c0401642c7894c06cc05589f2a575a53f1f743f54dd84","category":"Tech"}
