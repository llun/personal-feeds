Once you’ve worn a NAROO, you’ll be wishing you had one a year ago.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Even pre-Covid, living in the city you’ll have most likely seen a cyclist or two in a face mask in order to help keep out the pollutants coming from car, bus and lorry fumes. Wearing a proper mask on a bike can also help to keep out pollen, cold, heat, UV rays and fine dust. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With spring now upon us and cycling as popular as ever (as well as a pandemic that’s still lingering), it’s the easiest, and cheapest, way to fight hay fever and the only way to safely, and comfortably, fight against those other dangers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<div id=\"file-44643\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/naroo_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>NAROO, with its market-leading technologies and vast experience, offers sports masks that are not only a great choice for a lockdown shopping trip, but also for any cycle, no matter the season. They make breathing easy and keep glasses fog-free.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are five categories in NAROO’s range: Z for advanced anti-fog masks; F for filtering against pollen, pollution and pathogens; X for optimum sport comfort and breathability; N for extreme weather cooling and warming; and E for everyday and casual-wearing products.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Here are just a few of the breathable sports masks best suited for cycling that NAROO offers and what </span><em>Cyclist </em><span>editorial assistant Will Strickson</span><span> </span><span>thinks of them.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>NAROO F.U Plus</span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For those whose first face mask experience has come in the last year, this will be the most familiar style and fit. With a simple mouth and nose covering and straps over the ears, on the surface it’s not dissimilar to what we now see day to day.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>However the F.U Plus goes further. Its MICRONET™ filter fabric blocks 99% of dust and pollen particles as small as 1.7 microns (40 times smaller than human hair) and it maintains this level of protection even after 100 washes.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It also has adjustable straps, meaning that it not only promises a close fit for any face shape, but also that it fits, and holds, a lot better when cycling than your standard face mask.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It’s billed as an all-weather sports mask thanks to its 99% UV protection alongside its wide coverage of the bottom half of the face which, if needed, can help keep heat in. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Will’s</span><span> </span><span>verdict:</span><span> By far the most comfortable face mask I’ve worn, a really nice fit that didn’t need adjusting and felt super easy to breathe in the whole time. Didn’t overheat on London’s sunny March heatwave and the stylish look wasn’t out of place in the supermarket. I’d feel more secure wearing the others on the bike for a long period given the size of the straps but it didn’t ever feel like they would come off.</span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>NAROO F5s</span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In terms of build and usage, there’s not much difference between the F5S and the F.U Plus. It’s an all-weather sports mask with that same innovative MICRONET™ filter and UV protection.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where it differs is the style and fit. The F5S wraps fully around the head, ensuring there’s no doubt about its protection or security, with thick, cushioned loops sitting on the ears to hold it firmly in place.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>That extra material where the F.U Plus only has a strap – or nothing at all – is a soft jumper-like fabric that helps keep it comfortable as it wraps around the top of the neck.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Will’s verdict:</strong> While it is comfortable around the head and is really nice when you’re out on a cold day, I found the closer fit up front squashed my nose slightly meaning it needed adjustment when active. The ears straps are really cosy though and the full head wrap works nicely – it feels much more secure on the bike than a normal style mask like the F.U Plus.</em></p>\n<p><span><br />\n<div id=\"file-44648\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/naroo_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">NAROO F1S</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While it’s still an F-type filtering sports mask, the F1S is a significant departure in design over the previous two. It does maintain the MICRONET™ and has the same protective properties, however that’s only on one small front section.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Designed to be more suited to hot weather, outside that section there is a cooling, moisture-wicking fabric that’s a lot thinner and smoother on the skin. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Its straps are smaller too – more similar in structure to the F.U Plus, and it can also hold itself up without the straps so you can hide them away if you want to. That also makes it good for protecting your ears from the sun.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>On top of that, the back has Span Mesh, which not only keeps sweat and heat from the back of the head but can be switched to the front when dust and pollen protection isn’t needed to allow for more comfortable breathing while still protecting from insects.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Will’s verdict:</strong> The silky feel of the sides of the F1S is really comfortable and a lot nicer on a bearded face than the F5S. I wasn’t sure about how much the straps stand out at first but they hold up nicely and felt a lot more secure than when I tried to use it without. Its material and thinness makes it a really good option for more intense activity and when you want to keep your face cool. I’m not sure if I’d need to use the reverse option though.</em></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>NAROO X5</span></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Moving out of the F category takes us into a new ballpark, the X5 is refined to excel in sporting activity. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Essentially combining a face mask and a snood, the material stretches down from just below the eyes to cover the neck, making it an excellent choice for cold weather commutes. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While it doesn’t have MICRONET™, it uses X-Series Fabric Technology that ensures easy air flow and quick drying, is stretchy and form-fitting for comfort and protects against 99% of UV rays.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It also has double-sided use with the front providing super easy breathing and insect protection and the back keeping you safe from dust and holding out harsh winds.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Will’s verdict:</strong> Would be a really good choice for commuting, the neck protection and comfortable material mean winter mornings would be dreamy and the easy-breathing aspect wouldn’t restrict you in the summer. However the lack of pollution and pollen protection means it does fall behind the F types when it comes to city cycling. It is really secure and comfortable though, the coverage is good, breathing is easy and the ear loops are both soft and strong.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br />\n<div id=\"file-44646\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/naroo_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></span></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">NAROO N1</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The N1 is </span><span>the </span><span>choice for a hot weather breathable sports mask. Its quick-dry and ultra thin fabric means that you can be protected while staying cool when you’re in warmer climates.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is made from moisture-wicking, cool-to-the-touch fabric that maintains that 99% protection from UV while preventing moisture build-up and overheating.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Again, it’s a reversible sports mask with the front prioritising easy breathing with wide holes leaving plenty of space to get air in and the back providing blocking against insects and dust.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Will’s verdict:</strong> Clearly this mask is made to excel in different climes to the streets of London, with no pollution or pollen protection I wouldn’t wear it on a commute or ride in the city. However it’s obviously primed to provide important UV, dust and insect protection if you live, or ride, in parts of the world where those are more prominent. It could potentially even be a good choice for a gravel ride in the UK if you are susceptible to breathing difficulties.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>• For more on how NAROO Masks has the perfect
