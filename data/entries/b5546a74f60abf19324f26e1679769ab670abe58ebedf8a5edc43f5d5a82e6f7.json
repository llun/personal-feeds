The handlebar is being analysed by Canyon’s development and quality control departments, according to a statement issued by the company.</p>\n<p>“On Tuesday 2 March, at one of the opening classics races ‘Le Samyn’, a part of the handlebar of our Alpecin-Fenx pro Mathieu van der Poel (NED) quite obviously broke off during the race,” reads the statement.</p>\n<p>“Experts from the Canyon development and quality management departments immediately began analysis and testing to understand the cause of this incident.</p>\n<p>“The affected cockpits (CP0018 and CP0015) [are] only installed on the current Aeroad models CF SLX and CFR. The Aeroad CF SL model is not in any way affected by this issue.”</p>\n<p>The statement continues: “Canyon is therefore informing all affected Aeroad customers and asking them to stop using their bike for the time being.”</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mathieu van der Poel’s Canyon handlebar snapped during the Le Samyn one-day race.</span></figcaption><span> <i> Luc Claessen / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Canyon’s CP0018 and CP0015 integrated handlebars were developed for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-aeroad/\">new Aeroad</a>, launched in October, and feature an adjustable design, whereby the ‘wings’ of the bar can be widened or narrowed by 20mm.</p>\n<p>They can also be removed without needing to disconnect the gear or brake cables, to enable the bike to be packed for shipping or travel.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">2021 WorldTour team bikes</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wings of the CP0018 and CP0015 handlebars can be adjusted for fit or removed for travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Canyon founder Roman Arnold said: “Mathieu fortunately did not fall.
