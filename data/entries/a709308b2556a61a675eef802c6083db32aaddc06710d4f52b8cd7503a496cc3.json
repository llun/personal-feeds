If you are eligible and decide to participate, you will be provided an Apple Watch to wear. The watch will collect information about your health and activity. You will also be asked to answer simple survey questions in the Apple Research app on your ‌iPhone‌ about respiratory symptoms and lifestyle on a weekly and monthly basis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you get sick during the study, you will be provided with a free, at-home nasal swab to be tested for COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, and you will be asked to take some additional health measurements using your Apple Watch.</blockquote>The study is expected to take \"up to six months\" and participants accepted into the program will be provided with an Apple Watch for research purposes, which they will be expected to wear \"throughout the study, both day and night.\" Enrolment is open now for individuals in the greater Seattle area who are age 22 or older and have an Apple ‌iPhone‌ 6s or newer.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/study-apple-watch-predicts-covid-before-swab-test/\">previous independent study by Mount Sinai researchers</a> found that an Apple Watch can effectively predict a positive COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before current PCR-based nasal swab tests, which may be reinforced by the findings of this new study.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrevious independent Apple Watch studies have shown that the smartwatch's heart sensors may be able to detect <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/07/apple-watch-heart-rate-sensor-diabetes-detection/\">early signs of diabetes</a> and provide early <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/apple-heart-study-stanford-results/\">warning signs of atrial fibrillation</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/study-into-whether-apple-watch-can-detect-covid-19/\">Apple Launches Study into Whether Apple Watch Can Detect COVID-19</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-study-into-whether-apple-watch-can-detect-covid-19.2291656/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MaiJ4g3vRNg:Zh-_C8VjiVc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MaiJ4g3vRNg:Zh-_C8VjiVc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MaiJ4g3vRNg\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a709308b2556a61a675eef802c6083db32aaddc06710d4f52b8cd7503a496cc3","category":"Apple"}
