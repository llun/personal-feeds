Until today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ganna won no fewer than eight TTs in the last year. He won all three at the last Giro d&#8217;Italia. He won the world TT championship and the Italian national championship. He won the TT in last year&#8217;s Tirreno-Adriatico by 18 seconds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Tuesday&#8217;s time trial at Tirreno-Adriatico, both Wout van Aert and Stefan K√ºng went faster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I showed that I‚Äôm human, not a robot,&#8221; Ganna said at the finish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you previously confused Ganna for a robot, you are forgiven. It&#8217;s an easy mistake to make. Over the final 2.2 km of this year&#8217;s Tirreno TT, Ganna produced an average of 585 watts, according to Velon, peaking over 700 watts. He averaged 53.7 km/h over the 11 minutes and 17 seconds it took for him to complete the course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stage felt like it was Ganna&#8217;s for the taking, a 10.1-kilometer romp through San Benedetto del Tronto nearly identical to the course he won on last year. A Venn diagram of 10 km time trials and bike races Ganna will probably win is just a circle.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">üì∫ The final 10.

But Ganna, too, put in a hefty workload over the last six stages, pulling for Bernal and Geraint Thomas deep into difficult parcours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI immediately felt my legs weren‚Äôt great, I felt it,&#8221; Ganna said. &#8220;I managed to pull back something but now we can only think to the next chance.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ganna refused to make excuses ‚Äì&nbsp;the wind on the return leg was high early in the morning, when he went off, and some said it lessened by Van Aert&#8217;s start time later in the day. He&#8217;d lost four seconds to both Van Aert and K√ºng by the turnaround, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result was a reminder that there are no guarantees, and nowhere to hide, in the race of truth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm not sad,&#8221; Ganna said. &#8220;Every race is different. There is always someone who can be stronger.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/filippo-ganna-is-not-a-robot/\">Filippo Ganna is not a robot</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4624469571f87d4193f0267e907f9bca53fa9aadf4ff2a1cdd5826ed5354ec21","category":"Cycling"}
