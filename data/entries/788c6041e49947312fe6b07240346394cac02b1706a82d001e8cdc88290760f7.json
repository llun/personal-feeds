Importing data from spreadsheets is a pain (to say the least). Everything from encoding formats to document structure. Countless engineers are tasked with building data parsers from scratch: importing, mapping, validating, even presentation and UI. Rolling your own data importer takes developer time away from working on core product features. Flatfile has a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Flatfile Portal is the elegant import button for your web app. It drops into your product with pre-built SDKs, and guides users through an intuitive import experience in minutes. You can get Flatfile’s drop-in data importer running in your product in hours, not weeks. Give your users the import experience you always dreamed of, but never had time to build.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://get.flatfile.io/csv-import/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=daring-fireball-sponsorship-display_q1-2021-portal-promotion-week-2&amp;utm_content=sponsored-ad&amp;utm_term=cta\">Get started with Flatfile Portal today, for free</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Flatfile Portal’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/14/flatfile-portal\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"788c6041e49947312fe6b07240346394cac02b1706a82d001e8cdc88290760f7","category":"Tech"}
