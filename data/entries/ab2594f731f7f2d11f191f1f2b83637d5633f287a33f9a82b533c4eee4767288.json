[credit:\n                        Square Enix                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>Sony's latest PlayStation-focused video reveal event, as part of its State of Play series, was its shortest yet, lacking announcements on any first-party Sony games coming to either PlayStation 5 or the older PS4. Instead, the event was led by a third-party whopper: a remake of... <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/final-fantasy-vii-remake-spoiler-free-review-our-kind-of-cloud-gaming/\">last year's <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a>.</p>\n<p>That definition is a stretch, since this new title may be better classified as a graphical remaster, but there's a lot going on, as visible in the above gallery. The new game, <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em>, will land exclusively on PlayStation 5 consoles on June 10, and in good news, existing owners on PS4 will get nearly all of its content as a free upgrade (so long as they either own the game digitally or have a disc-based PS5). That content includes a sweeping graphical overhaul with new lighting, texture, and particle systems and an optional 60 fps mode, plus a new \"classic\" option for the game's active battling system. Picking \"classic\" will let players focus entirely on selecting commands from menus, instead of giving direct joystick control to a \"lead\" character like Cloud or Tifa.</p>\n<p>For existing owners who may have already beaten the game, the incentive to double-dip comes in the form of a new \"episode\" of content. This will put players in control of original series character Yuffie, and the revealed footage includes her and a companion named Sonon spending time in existing game regions like the Sector 7 slums—and Yuffie using Sonon as a springboard to pull off cinematic, sweeping attacks. To access this new chapter, existing owners will have to pay for the extra DLC, though publisher Square Enix hasn't yet clarified how much that will cost.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745306#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745306&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab2594f731f7f2d11f191f1f2b83637d5633f287a33f9a82b533c4eee4767288","category":"Tech"}
