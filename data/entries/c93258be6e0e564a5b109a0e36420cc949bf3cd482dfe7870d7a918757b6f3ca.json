The malware is getting installed on Exchange servers that were previously infected by attackers exploiting a critical vulnerability in the Microsoft email program. Attacks started while the vulnerability was still a zero-day. Even after Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/03/microsoft-issues-emergency-patches-for-4-exploited-0days-in-exchange/\">issued an emergency patch</a>, as many as 100,000 servers that didn’t install it in time <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/tens-of-thousands-of-us-organizations-hit-in-ongoing-microsoft-exchange-hack/\">were infected</a>.</p>\n<h2>Opportunity knocks</h2>\n<p>The hackers behind those attacks installed a web shell that allowed anyone who knew the URL to completely control the compromised servers. Black Kingdom was <a href=\"https://www.speartip.com/resources/black-kingdom-ransomware-exploiting-exchange-vulnerabilities/\">spotted last week</a> by Security firm SpearTip. Marcus Hutchins, a security researcher at security firm Kryptos Logic, reported on Sunday that the malware <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1373634465340264451\">didn’t actually encrypt files</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751780#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751780&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c93258be6e0e564a5b109a0e36420cc949bf3cd482dfe7870d7a918757b6f3ca","category":"Tech"}
