Fast forward to today and Dynaplug has announced two new repair tools that answer one of our earlier complaints in relation to fixing road tubeless flats. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dynaplug tool range has long been effective at fixing punctures in road tubeless systems, but one ongoing issue is that the length of the plug insertion tube (which is optimised for larger-volume mountain bike and gravel tyres) can bottom out on the rim when used with low-volume road tyres. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since our original review, Dynaplug has teased a shorter road-specific version of the tool, and finally, they’ve added such a product to the range in the form of the Air Road and Carbon Road Racer. The new additions will work across most tyre types, but they are optimised for use with road tyres ranging from 25-32 mm in width. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Air Road is simply a 7 mm-shorter version of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/12/dynaplug-tubeless-tyre-repair-review-air-racer-carbonlite/\" target=\"_blank\">original Air</a>, a patented tool that combines a tubeless plug with a CO2 inflator. You can use it simply as a tubeless plug, or you can use it to inflate the tyre through the hole before leaving the plug to seal it. The tool also comes with a separate hose that allows you to use it as a regular CO2 inflator through the valve, too. This kit sells for US$75. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there’s a shortened “Road” version of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/ct-tech-round-up-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Ultralite Racer</a> (US$48). Made from a composite material, this epi-pen-like tool weighs just 14 grams and provides loaded plugs on both ends of the tool. However, where the regular Racer tools offer both regular and oversized plugs, the Road version provides the same regular-sized plugs on each end with 7 mm shorter insertion tubes. This tool includes a mount that fits under a bottle cage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /><figcaption>The Carbon Road Racer.

These aim to leave less plug material exposed after the fix, something that should benefit tight-clearance road bikes. The plugs also feature the company’s revised “soft nose” design that removes the sharp point from the brass tip. A five pack costs US$12. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two new road-specific tools and matching plugs retain the same pricing as the original offerings. That pricing is certainly at the premium end of tubeless repair tools, but the product remains the benchmark in the eyes of many CyclingTips team members. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.dynaplug.com/buy.html\" target=\"_blank\">dynaplug.com</a>. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/dynaplug-launches-shortened-repair-tools-for-road-tubeless-tyres/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ade7c8ff38db61a0458ce747e6d3556fb6f053cb9a8a612d8ffc3d300ef96513","category":"Cycling"}
