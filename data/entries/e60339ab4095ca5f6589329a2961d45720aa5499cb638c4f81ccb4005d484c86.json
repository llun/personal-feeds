{"title":"Pros Playlist: Oss, The punk of peloton","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/pros-playlist-oss-the-punk-of-peloton/","date":1618426707000,"content":"<p>Welcome to the second episode of what I hope will be an ongoing series, The Pain Cave PlayList. If you didn’t see episode one with Bora-Hansgrohe’s Lukas Pöstlberger, then you won’t be clued up on what all this is about. Quite simply, it’s an excuse to chat music on a cycling website. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t enjoy music – it’s something that reaches everyone in some shape or form – but it touches some people more than others, and they’re the people I’m hunting down in the world of cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the musicians, I’m reversing it, hunting down the people who work within the music industry who have a passion for cycling. I’ve got an absolute storming guest for episode three already filmed and in the bag. I’ll then nudge them in the right direction to build us a playlist, maybe even a playlist that would be ideal for riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that first episode a few weeks back, I’ll be honest, Lukas Pöstlberger disappointed me; he’s Austrian, has a background in classical music, but surprisingly didn’t include <em>any Schubert. </em> I suppose it’s not the stuff to get you fired up for a race or training. The rest of his playlist was “banging”, something which would get the blood flowing when warming up for a race or making the legs hurt on a Zwift route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lukas was the first person who recommended this week’s guest, Daniel Oss, but he wasn’t the only one. Twitter and Youtube commenters also requested I hunt down and chat with the long-haired Italian. It turns out he’s a bit of a punk. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CORVOS_00032491-085-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Oss plays bass in his spare time, and claims he’s the bass of the Bora-Hansgrohe team too. Who are we to argue.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel’s playlist is a world away from Lukas’ “twiddly, tweet tweet” electronica; instead, it’s a bit rawer, a bit agro, more informed by his days as a teenager wanting to escape from his small hometown in Italy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We delve into a few tracks that he’d happily have on repeat; this week, I pose the question if Spotify didn’t exist, if MP3s weren’t a thing, if we were back before the iPod, what four albums would he have in his bag for a three-week tour? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about how he sees himself as the bass guitar of the Bora-Hansgrohe team – an instrument he’s also mastered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Daniel’s Pain Cave Playlist</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/pros-playlist-oss-the-punk-of-peloton/\">Pros Playlist: Oss, The punk of peloton</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e60339ab4095ca5f6589329a2961d45720aa5499cb638c4f81ccb4005d484c86","category":"Cycling"}
