An executive order barred companies (even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/huaweis-export-ban-is-wider-in-scope-than-most-people-imagine/\">international companies</a>) from selling Huawei hardware or software that contained US technology, and additional restrictions on trade with Huawei have made it extremely difficult for the company to keep building networking equipment and smartphones. It has been a tough few years for Huawei, but now that the Biden administration is in charge, will things be any different?</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-files-u-s-lawsuit-disputing-it-is-a-security-threat-11612880705\">The Wall Street Journal</a> reports, Huawei certainly seems to be sending out feelers now that President Biden has settled in. One of the tools used against Huawei was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/small-isps-stunned-by-fcc-move-to-ban-huawei-zte-gear-during-pandemic/\">an FCC ruling last year</a> that declared Huawei a national security threat and barred US telecommunications companies from using government funding to buy Huawei gear. Huawei has filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit challenging the ruling, calling it “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence.”</p>\n<p>Xiaomi filed a similar lawsuit <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/xiaomi-denies-ties-to-chinas-military-calls-us-ruling-unconstitutional/\">earlier this month</a> after, in one of its last acts in power, the Trump administration declared Xiaomi a “Communist Chinese military company\" and barred US citizens from owning Xiaomi stock. Xiaomi called the ruling “unlawful and unconstitutional,” arguing that it denied the company legal due process.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741126#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741126&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6cae1f8af17e690c21f456bfbfe622b8550f7b389471907c935a4dd9479056fe","category":"Tech"}
