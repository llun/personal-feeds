Why 48 hours this time? We were so impressed by the extremely high number of quality talk submissions that we decided to expand the number we accepted this year and expand our hours accordingly.</p>\n<p>We've made video clips for some of the individual talks and have posted them in the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/resources\">HashiCorp Resource Library</a> with full abstracts for each talk along with slides for some. Today we wanted to highlight a few of those talks.</p>\n<p>In this first HashiTalks 2021 highlights blog, we’re sharing a handful of talks about our oldest open source tools, HashiCorp Vagrant and Packer, and our newest projects, HashiCorp Boundary and Waypoint, as well as a few product-agnostic talks.
