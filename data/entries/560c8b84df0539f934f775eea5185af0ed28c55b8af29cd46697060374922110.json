While we've seen this deal available for a few weeks, the game itself still only launched less than a month ago, so we figured it was worth highlighting for anyone who planned on picking it up elsewhere (and doesn't mind waiting for a physical copy to ship).</p>\n<p>In general, <em>Hitman 3</em> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/hitman-iii-review-lets-call-it-hitman-2-5-and-be-fine-with-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doesn't stray far from its predecessors</a> but provides another collection of playful and slyly comedic sandboxes in which to goof around. It puts a bit more emphasis on the narrative surrounding globe-trotting assassin <a href=\"https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Agent_47\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agent 47</a>, which can be hit or miss, but most of its six worlds still give you several avenues to explore on the way to each hit. While this isn't the kind of game that will change anyone's opinion of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/hitman/\">series</a>, it's as good a starting point as any for those who've thought about giving the saga a try, since it's possible to download and play the first two installments directly within this latest game. We should also note that anyone who buys the PS4 or Xbox One edition can download a <a href=\"https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-pre-launch-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">next-gen upgrade</a> at no extra cost.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we have good discounts on recommended gadgets like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/the-best-nintendo-switch-accessories-you-can-buy/#h5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FastSnail Grips</a> for Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/best-magsafe-accessories-for-iphone-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple's MagSafe Charger</a> for the iPhone 12, plus a variety of laptop deals and a low price on SanDisk's 400GB Ultra microSD card (for those who don't mind trading speed for high capacity on the cheap). You can find those and more in our curated roundup below.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742597#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742597&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"560c8b84df0539f934f775eea5185af0ed28c55b8af29cd46697060374922110","category":"Tech"}
