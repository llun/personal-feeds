The FCC also set up a new website at which people can sign up for the subsidies.</p>\n<p>\"As of May 12, 2021, eligible households will be able to enroll in the program to receive a monthly discount off the cost of broadband service from an approved provider. Eligible households can enroll through an approved provider or by visiting <a href=\"https://getemergencybroadband.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://getemergencybroadband.org</a>,\" the FCC said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/50-per-month-emergency-broadband-subsidies-approved-in-pandemic-stimulus/\" target=\"_blank\">Congress approved the subsidies in December,</a> but it took a few months for the FCC to set up the program. The FCC had previously said enrollment would begin at the end of April. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-broadband-benefit-providers\" target=\"_blank\">list of providers</a> to determine whether your ISP is participating in the discount program. There's also a \"Companies Near Me\" <a href=\"https://getemergencybroadband.org/companies-near-me/\" target=\"_blank\">tool</a> that will become active closer to the May 12 start date.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761308#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761308&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c9629e5ac6b752856a595a6e9d566b1323a410cdf9c0f58a43b145fa5f08abcc","category":"Tech"}
