Apple is expected to complete the transition next year and has so far only released four Macs with the first iteration of Apple silicon, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs a result of the four Macs with ‌M1‌ and upcoming releases, Intel this year will lose 50% of its orders from Apple, and eventually, losing all orders from the Cupertino tech giant will lead to Intel's market share falling below 80% in 2023, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210618PD204.html\">DigiTimes</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>However, Apple's in-house developed Arm-based processor series is expected to play the key role in taking a major chunk from Intel's share in the upcoming year, the sources said.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntel is expected to lose nearly 50% of its orders from Apple in 2021 and will eventually obtain no orders from the client. Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.</blockquote>Intel is seemingly aware of the impact that Apple silicon will have on its business as it has run multiple marketing campaigns against Macs, touting the view that laptops powered by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/\">Intel processors are superior compared to Apple silicon Macs</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Apple is testing high-end Apple silicon chips with as many as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/bloomberg-mac-pro-32-high-performance-cores/\">32 high performance cores and 128 core options for graphics</a> for future Mac releases.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/intel-market-share-falling-apple-silicon/\">Intel Processor Market Share May Fall to New Low Next Year Due to Apple Silicon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intel-processor-market-share-may-fall-to-new-low-next-year-due-to-apple-silicon.2301382/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-Mo7-zfiDMs:GXtOvBw5YkY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-Mo7-zfiDMs:GXtOvBw5YkY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-Mo7-zfiDMs\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d791651edee146356225b6f2043a9108af829ca8836a7fa15c522a9533c3f7df","category":"Apple"}
