These patients\nare so much in denial, they are volunteering this information.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A lot of these folks probably don’t believe in Darwinism, either, which I suppose is ironic.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/01/canadian-covidiots\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f0468b364f2968669db362077b64f9ca4389bc052e7fbe7f8de84d0d3b622d7d","category":"Tech"}
