{"title":"OLIVIA DILLION’S ROUTT RSL–THE SET UP FOR BIG MILES","link":"https://moots.com/olivia-dillions-routt-rsl-the-set-up-for-big-miles/","date":1623449481000,"content":"<p>Back in the “before times”, when close gatherings were a thing and we blissfully lived in a non-COVID-aware world, we met Olivia Dillion on a two-day<span></span> mixed ride to Sea Otter. Our dealer/partner Studio Velo and Moots had been talking about a way to get to the event from their shop in Mill Valley, California. Well, leave it up to the master of route lay out Chris Reed (of Studio Velo) to devise a route that would have us stay away from the main coastal road to Monterey and take the path much, much less traveled. Two back-to-back 100 mile + days each with 10K feet of climbing got the job done. On that trip we loaned out a few bikes and soon into the first day of riding Olivia was hooked on the prowess of the Routt RSL. We fell in love with Velocio clothing (Olivia is sales director there) and we believe Olivia did the same for our bike.</p>\n<p>Flash forward to 2021 and Olivia has had her own Routt RSL for about a year and a half at this point. She’s ridden it all over the world and has racked up some beautiful memories, some huge miles, and some great results. Wonder how her bike is set up? Let’s have a look:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0021-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Frame: 52cm Routt RSL, internal rear brake, Di2 routing (STANLEY FINISH)</p>\n<p>Fork: Moots Gravel (full carbon)</p>\n<p>Stem: Moots Ti</p>\n<p>Post: Moots Cinch Post</p>\n<p>Head Set: Chris King I7</p>\n<p>Group Set: Shimano GRX (Di2) 1 x 11 (42T front, 11-42 cassette)</p>\n<p>Wheels: Astral rims, rolling on White Industries hubs</p>\n<p>Tires: Various, WTB at Unbound</p>\n<p>As you can see, it’s a very straight forward, no-nonsense build. Reliability ranks high for long gravel events and this has proven to be a trusty steed for the job.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/0017_DSC_2206_2400x.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Olivia at THE TRAKA event just 4 weeks ago. 360KM and she took the win! For that type of distance Olivia adds a handlebar bag and half-frame bag for clothing, snacks and repair kits.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia_UnBound_Velocio-91_1800x.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Olivia at Unbound. The Moots Stanley finish looking no worse for wear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia-1800x1000-unbound_2400x.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The Flint Hills of Kansas show no mercy. Olivia had a tough go and suffered in the heat and wind, but in the end finished!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/olivia_UnBound_Velocio-13_1800x.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://moots.com/olivia-dillions-routt-rsl-the-set-up-for-big-miles/\">OLIVIA DILLION’S ROUTT RSL–THE SET UP FOR BIG MILES</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots</a>.</p>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"68ecfbe915e5ccdc832a7f0488c122cd2de434dfb359151b3702fd61ed5fb2bf","category":"Cycling"}
