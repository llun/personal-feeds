On Tuesday, the company revealed the car to the world, with one of its now-traditional light shows, albeit by livestream rather than in front of an audience. It's called the e-tron GT, and it's a sleek four-door, four-seater that shares more than a little with the excellent electric Porsche Taycan.</p>\n<h2>Spot the difference</h2>\n<p>Audi has been showing off <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/audi-is-planning-20-all-electric-models-by-2025-heres-how-it-will-do-it/\">an e-tron GT concept since 2019</a>, and the production car differs very little from that show car, save for some sensors embedded in the front bodywork. The design language is very obviously Audi's, with hints of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/06/the-2019-audi-a7-might-be-all-the-car-anyone-ever-needs/\">A7 fastback</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/the-audi-r8-v10-performance-they-wont-make-them-like-this-much-longer/\">R8 supercar</a> depending on where you look. But aerodynamics have been at least as much a concern as curb appeal, as the drag coefficient is nice and low at 0.24.</p>\n<p>The e-tron GT is built on the Taycan's J1 platform, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-porsches-new-electric-car/\">and so these specs may therefore look familiar</a>. The car is built around its 93.4kWh lithium-ion battery pack (total capacity, net, is believed to be 85kWh), and utilizes an 800V electrical architecture that allows it to DC fast charge at up to 270kW, which means, like the Taycan, you can go from 5 to 80 percent in 22.5 minutes. AC charging is at 11kW by default, with an optional 22kW onboard charger available shortly after launch. It's too soon for an EPA range estimate, but Audi says it should achieve 298 miles (488km) on the European WLTP cycle.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740731#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740731&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
