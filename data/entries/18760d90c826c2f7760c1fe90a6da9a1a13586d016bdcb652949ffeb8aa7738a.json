The bird, named Farby, moves up with every tap, and users must ensure that Farby doesn't hit any obstacles along the way, or else the game ends.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe app grew immensely popular in 2014, even at one point <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/03/11/flappy-bird-dong-nguyen-interview/\">generating $50,000/day</a> thanks to in-app ads. Despite its removal from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, a number of games to this day continue to be made and played with inspiration from Flappy Bird.
