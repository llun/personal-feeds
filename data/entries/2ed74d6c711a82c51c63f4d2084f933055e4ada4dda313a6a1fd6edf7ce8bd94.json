Named after the Kansas city <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/unbound-2021-bikes/\">Unbound Gravel</a> calls home, the new wheels are a more affordable sibling to the range-topping Emporia GC3 Pro.</p>\n<p>The Emporia GC3 Performance is priced at $1,650 for the set and features a 700c rim that’s 30mm deep and 26mm wide internally. Pricing in other territories is to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>According to HED, the Emporia’s rim design is optimised for easy gravel tyre installation, while also taking aerodynamics into account (although no specific aero claims are made).</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/EGC3Performance_Rear_Angled_White-c942cc9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Emporia GC3 Performance is a more affordable counterpart to the Emporia GC3 Pro.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>HED</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/EGC3Performance_Front_Angled_White-c20524c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The wheelset is based on a 30mm-deep carbon rim.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>HED</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>We’re seeing ever-wider gravel rims hitting the market and the Emporia GC3 Performance is at the broader end of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>The internal width of 26mm demands a minimum 32mm-wide tyre, and externally the rims measure 31mm across at their widest. Despite these substantial dimensions, rim weight is respectably low at a claimed 405g.</p>\n<p>Built up with HED’s own hubs and 24 Sapim Race double-butted spokes front and rear, the total claimed weight for the Emporia GC3 Performance wheelset is 1,545g, a penalty of just 25g over the $2,400 Emporia GC3 Pro.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Emporia wheelset is aimed squarely at gravel with a 32mm minimum tyre size.</span></figcaption><span> <i>HED</i></span></div>\n<p>Like a number of recently launched gravel wheels, including the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/ffwd-drift-wheelsets-review/\">FFWD Drift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/zipp-303-firecrest-wheelset-review/\">Zipp 303 Firecrest</a>, the Emporias use a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rim design</a>, meaning they’re not suitable for non-tubeless tyres. HED reckons it can produce a tougher rim this way, better able to withstand abuse.</p>\n<p>Hookless can mean tyre compatibility headaches with road rims, but there tend to be fewer issues with gravel-sized tyres which are run at lower pressures. As ever, though, we strongly advise sticking to both rim and tyre maker’s recommendations here.</p>\n<p>The Emporia GC3 Performance wheelset is made in the US and is available to buy now.</p>","author":"Matthew Loveridge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"2ed74d6c711a82c51c63f4d2084f933055e4ada4dda313a6a1fd6edf7ce8bd94","category":"Cycling"}
