Literati is dedicated to the idea that great books should not be hard to find. They’ve created a book club so good, you might actually join. Those are their words, not mine, but I love that attitude. Literati doesn’t merely offer book recommendations — they host communities of book lovers where discussion is thoughtful and nuanced.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://literati.com/book-clubs/?utm_source=DaringFireballRSS&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=lumilaunch&amp;utm_content=luminary\">Try Literati today</a> and get your next read chosen by visionaries — then talk about it with them, in a book club unlike any other.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/16/literati\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"42a7596edce3d297f88c540c22cfa3450391778a2b895095f9f9367b162d6b54","category":"Tech"}
