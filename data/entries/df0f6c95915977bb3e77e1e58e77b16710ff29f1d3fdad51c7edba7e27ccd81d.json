{"title":"Hands-On With Kensington's New $400 StudioDock for iPad Pro","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/kensington-studiodock-ipad-pro/","date":1615896328000,"content":"Kensington in February began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/kensington-studiodock-preorders/\">accepting pre-orders</a> for the <a href=\"https://store.kensington.com/products/studiodockTM-ipad-docking-station\">StudioDock docking station</a> that it released for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and now those StudioDock orders have started arriving to customers. We picked up one of the new StudioDocks to see if it's worth the high purchase price for an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> workflow.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoWMFtAvNk4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nAvailable for the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the 10.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, and the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the StudioDock has a magnetic base where an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can attach, and it can be used in either landscape or portrait mode. We have the version for the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it looks kind of like the Pro Display XDR stand.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis isn't an Apple-designed product so it's not quite as high quality as the Pro XDR stand, but the aluminum design looks nice on a desk, and the plastic back panel is hidden. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; attaches magnetically to the rubberized front of the stand, and plugs in to the USB-C connector.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to orienting the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in landscape or portrait mode, you can also adjust the angle up and down to get the ideal position for what you're doing, and once situated, it doesn't move around.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe dock offers 37.5W passthrough charging to charge your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; at full speed through USB-C, plus it adds multiple ports and charges your other accessories. There are three USB-A ports, one USB-C port, an HDMI 2.0 port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, an SD card reader, a Gigabit Ethernet port, and a power button. There are also two spots for Kensington locks to protect the StudioDock.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOn the built-in Qi-based wireless charging pad that's at the bottom, you can charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, or any other Qi-based device, plus you can add-on a separate Apple Watch charging puck. You'll need to give up the USB-C port on the side whenever you want to use it, though. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charging spot charges at 7.5W, while the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; spot charges at 5W.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAt the &#36;380 to &#36;400 price point, the StudioDock is aimed at those who use their iPads in a professional capacity. If the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is your main work or school machine and you're using it in lieu of a Mac or PC, the StudioDock adds all of the versatility you need for a full day of work.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you're using your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in a more casual capacity and have other Apple products that you use alongside it, the StudioDock is likely overkill.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe StudioDock can be <a href=\"https://store.kensington.com/products/studiodockTM-ipad-docking-station\">purchased from the Kensington website</a>. It's priced at &#36;380 for the 11-inch model that works with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &#36;400 for the 12.9-inch model designed for Apple's largest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/kensington-studiodock-ipad-pro/\">Hands-On With Kensington&#039;s New &#36;400 StudioDock for iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-kensingtons-new-400-studiodock-for-ipad-pro.2288490/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kUZpxKN7ce8:8-SopZIIgCY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kUZpxKN7ce8:8-SopZIIgCY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kUZpxKN7ce8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df0f6c95915977bb3e77e1e58e77b16710ff29f1d3fdad51c7edba7e27ccd81d","category":"Apple"}
