But it only has two years on the Air Force's <em>other</em> senior citizen, an aircraft that will likely keep flying for as long as the B-52: the venerable Boeing 707.</p>\n<p>While the Air Force is working on phasing out the KC-135 refueling plane (which was developed alongside the 707 by Boeing in 1956), the 707 lives on in many other guises. There's the Air Force's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-3_Sentry\">E-3 AWACS</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_E-8_Joint_STARS\">E-8 JSTARS</a> command and control aircraft, as well as the US Navy's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-6_Mercury\">E-6B Mercury</a> strategic command and control aircraft (also known as the \"doomsday plane\"), all based on the 707 airframe. And as much as the Air Force might want to send its 707-based aircraft off to the boneyard—the majority of those aircraft were delivered before most active service members were even born—the US Congress recently made that goal more difficult to achieve.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748481#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748481&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sean Gallagher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"48ba593d0aaca023630c377746f738ac099204d6b03878e8942dbfa326fc6927","category":"Tech"}
