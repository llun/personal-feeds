The trial will look at safety, different doses, and immune responses.</p>\n<p>The vaccine, called <a href=\"https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/d28b8af8-cc06-4233-9c43-f7f5b8d69430\">mRNA-1010</a>, is designed to target four lineages of influenza viruses that circulate seasonally each year, just like the current <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/quadrivalent.htm\">quadrivalent flu vaccines</a> on the market. The four virus lineages are those identified by the World Health Organization as the ones to target for disease prevention each yearâ€”seasonal influenza type A lineages H1N1 and H3N2 as well as influenza type B lineages Yamagata and Victoria. If mRNA-1010 is shown to be effective against the yearly plague in later-stage trials, Moderna aims to eventually bundle it with three other mRNA-based vaccines to create a yearly one-stop shot.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778684#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778684&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b710d7225fb008b80e8b7bf723da6651221a9b89dfa76248d74bad5b277600ae","category":"Tech"}
