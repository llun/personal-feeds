DoorDash, which heavily uses contract workers for food deliveries, saw its stockÂ fall by 8 percent. The S&amp;P 500 stock index is up slightly.</p>\n<p>The legal status of workers driving for Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash has become a controversial issue around the world. The companies argue that the contractor model allows them to not only operate more efficiently but also offer drivers increased flexibility. Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash argue that if they were forced to pay drivers by the hour, the companies would have to not only raise fares but also restrict drivers' hours to make sure drivers only work at times when there are enough customers to keep them busy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761333#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761333&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
