But since you&rsquo;re here now, allow us to catch you up on all of the stuff you need to know from the past week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ipad-pros-are-finally-coming-we-think\">iPad Pros are finally coming (we think)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After lots of false hope over the past several weeks, It looks like <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342720/the-ipad-pro-may-finally-launch-next-week-with-no-event-nothing-else.html\">new iPad Pros are finally on the way</a>, possibly arriving as early as Tuesday. If you haven&rsquo;t been <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/ipad-pro-2021-release-date-price-specs-rumours-3788259/\">following the rumors</a>, we&rsquo;re expecting a mini LED display, A14X processor, and a better camera. The design will likely stay the same and we&rsquo;ll hopefully get a few high-end features to separate it from the Air, such as Thunderbolt 4 and pro apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the other rumored products&mdash;AirTags, AirPods, and Apple TV&mdash;might not be joining the party. The latest rumors say there won&rsquo;t be an event to usher in the new iPad, which means it could be a standalone release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"chips-shortage-are-starting-to-affect-production\">Chips shortage are starting to affect production</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While supply constraints and chip shortages have been affecting the automotive and graphics card industries for a while, Apple has thus far avoided any serious impact. But <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342900/apple-products-spring-event-delayed-chip-shortages-ipad-macbook-airpods.html\">a new report from Nikkei Asia</a> says Apple has pushed pack production of its two iPad and MacBook models after they were hit with shortages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And things could get worse. Just this week, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/gm-manufacturing-chip-shortage/&amp;xcust=1-1-342900-0-0-0%7Cxid:fr1618028169214efd&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/342900/apple-products-spring-event-delayed-chip-shortages-ipad-macbook-airpods.html\">Ford and GM shuttered several factories</a> due to chip shortages, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-reportedly-canceled&amp;xcust=1-1-342900-0-0-0%7Cxid:fr1618028169214djd&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/342900/apple-products-spring-event-delayed-chip-shortages-ipad-macbook-airpods.html\">Google reportedly canceled the Pixel 5a</a> also due to chips issues. Thus far, we haven&rsquo;t heard anything about the iPhone&mdash;and Apple is in a stronger position since it manufactures its own chips&mdash;but it seems likely that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/iphone-13-12s-rumors-specs-display-notch-camera-colors-release.html\">iPhone 13</a> will be delayed at least as long as last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"find-my-everything\">Find My&hellip; everything</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re ever going to see AirTags, but Apple&rsquo;s announcement this week might be even better. For the first time ever, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342763/apple-opens-up-its-find-my-network-to-third-party-devices-no-airtag-needed.html\">third-party devices will be able to tap into Apple&rsquo;s Find My network</a> so users can track non-Apple things. There are only a handful of devices at launch, including a pair of VanMoof e-bikes and Belkin true wireless earbuds. There&rsquo;s also a keyring tracker from Chipolo that looks an awful lot like the rumored AirTags. Apple says more partners are coming soon, and if enough Find My devices launch, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/342787/apple-just-made-its-long-rumored-airtags-trackers-completely-unnecessary.html\">it could make AirTags irrelevant before they even arrive</a>.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Weekly Apple Update: New iPads finally on the way but supply shortages cause delays","siteHash":"708af0bd566e01ce26265ad5a11229c7e9e61e6ee092f34bf2980378fb39365a","entryHash":"710194d5f26582ff3c3c9592bb53e9699158277a551ba7400aac7b553439ea7b","category":"Apple"}
