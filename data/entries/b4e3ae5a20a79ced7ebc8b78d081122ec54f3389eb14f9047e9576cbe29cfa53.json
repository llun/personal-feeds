That certainly begins with products like the all-new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, but it extends to efforts like the 8 gigawatts of new clean energy we'll help bring onto the grid and our $430 billion investment in the United States over the next 5 years.\"</blockquote>As has been the case for over a year now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in June, as considerable uncertainty surrounding the global health situation's impact remains.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/2q21_pie.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple will <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/\">provide live streaming</a> of its fiscal Q2 2021 financial results conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific, and <em>MacRumors</em> will update this story with coverage of the conference call highlights.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Conference call starts at 2:00 p.m. Pacific - No need to refresh</b> <img src=\"https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/loading.gif\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Loading live updates...</div> \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/apple-2q-2021-earnings/\">Apple Reports 2Q 2021 Results: $23.6B Profit on $89.6B Revenue, Record Mac and Services Revenue</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-2q-2021-results-23-6b-profit-on-89-6b-revenue-record-mac-and-services-revenue.2293769/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_e6lANvMEOA:D6F2m727TH4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_e6lANvMEOA:D6F2m727TH4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_e6lANvMEOA\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4e3ae5a20a79ced7ebc8b78d081122ec54f3389eb14f9047e9576cbe29cfa53","category":"Apple"}
