After seven days of bad press and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/cd-projekt-red-offers-refunds-to-unsatisfied-cyberpunk-2077-console-players/\">CD Projekt Red launching a refund program</a>, Sony went one step further by yanking the game entirely from its online shops and informing buyers that they were eligible for a refund if they were dissatisfied with their digital purchase.</p>\n<p>At the time, neither Sony nor CDPR offered a road map for exactly when the game might go back for sale on Sony's digital shops, even though the developer made clear that it would continue patching the game on all platforms. (The game was never delisted on Xbox.) Last week, CDPR confirmed in <a href=\"https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-34-2021/\">a regulatory statement</a> that the game would return to PSN this week, and that came to pass on Monday. In conjunction, the game's digital purchase price <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4497-CUSA16596_00-0000000000000004\" target=\"_blank\">dropped $10 to $50</a> (possibly because the news coincided with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime Day</a>, where the game's digital and disc versions are <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Warner-Bros-PlayStation-4%2F786104378&amp;subid1=ArsPrimeDayRetailers2021\" target=\"_blank\">also discounted</a>).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775028#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775028&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b63ef174a80c85df956f8f266a2ac38211e96bf5c197d640af9b40f0d38e0a1","category":"Tech"}
