The perception was that gravel had already matured to the point where as a category it would evolve towards a destination model akin to mountain biking. If it worked, then suddenly rural drive-by towns had a chance to leverage gravel bikes towards social prosperity. This is why we created the Explore Las Animas campaign in 2019, which included a website with community and route information. Unfortunately came down and I&#8217;ve been brainstorming on ways to get one back up since&#8230;<span id=\"more-208062\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.farquartergravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.farquartergravel.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617333014602000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPmTlQO_H3_Xlq60LUe_4ZwYsh9g\">Far Quarter Gravel</a> is that new site. It&#8217;s designed to keep the conversation going, while also introducing and inspiring new cyclists to check out the southeastern Colorado and northeast New Mexico scene. Stephen Beneski (@beneskidesign) continues to provide awesome art illustrations. The art has helped generate a healthy conversation around bikes in Trinidad, Colorado.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2346\" height=\"1502\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-208064\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?w=2346&amp;quality=75 2346w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=1024,656&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=2000,1280&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=768,492&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=1800,1152&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=1335,855&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=700,448&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=1536,983&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-01-at-8.07.07-AM.png?resize=2048,1311&amp;quality=75 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2346px) 100vw, 2346px\" /></p>\n<p>2021 is shaping up to be a watershed year for Trinidad. It&#8217;s been relatively insulated from outside attention for a long time. However things are changing very quickly. Bicycles are now part of a conversation around the community&#8217;s future in a very positive way. In less than three years it&#8217;s put itself on a path towards becoming a gravel bike destination. Pretty crazy. Fortunately for us. The Radavist has been helping tell our story since the beginning. Thanks John.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy researching, planning, and making a visit to Trinidad in the near future. Backshop Bikes has some cool things in the works for the summer. A new Trinidad-Las Animas County Gravel Adventure Field Guide book we&#8217;ve designed is coming out. There are three (capped participation) adventure rides supported by <a href=\"https://www.otterbox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.otterbox.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617333014602000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGprU02fFDOi_QRX4iTlp0a-ayqA\">OtterBox</a> planned for June, August, and September to consider joining. August&#8217;s ride will be a full moon ride. Art prints available now. A pop-up event space is in the works too for June to September. More details coming soon.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re cruising through don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out for advice or with questions.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"c3aa94ee4e46987f2a0c70b4ce4b2e983ff9a48fb4fb8ea3268aa487a3dc6ca7","category":"Cycling"}
