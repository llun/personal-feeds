The backbone for NASA’s Moon to Mars plans are the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, ground systems at Kennedy Space Center, Gateway in lunar orbit and human landing system. We currently are also<b> </b>assessing various elements of our programs to find efficiencies and opportunities to reduce costs, and this exercise is ongoing. This will include conversations with our industry partners. Budget forecasts and internal agency reviews are common practice as they help us with long-term planning. The agency anticipates taking full advantage of the powerful SLS capabilities, and this effort will improve the current construct associated with executing the development, production and operations of the NASA’s Artemis missions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The original story appears below.</p>\n<p><strong>Original story</strong>: NASA is conducting an internal review of the Space Launch System rocket's affordability, two sources have told Ars Technica.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749541#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749541&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7372848424e75c153b72ddaedcd6ca35a47c19dbb9373152e35623d3326d9cc","category":"Tech"}
