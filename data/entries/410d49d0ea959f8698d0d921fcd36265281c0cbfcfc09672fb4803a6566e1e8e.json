The quarter runs from July through September.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo previously said the third-generation AirPods would be released in the first half of 2021, and a series of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">leaked photos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/leaked-renders-for-third-gen-airpods/\">renders</a> certainly made it seem like a launch was imminent, but this no longer appears to be the case.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe third-generation AirPods are expected to have a similar design as the AirPods Pro, including shorter stems, but without silicone ear tips or active noise cancellation, allowing for a lower price. The second-generation AirPods retail for &#36;159 with a wired charging case or for &#36;199 with a wireless charging case, while the AirPods Pro run &#36;249.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple released the second-generation AirPods in March 2019, followed by the AirPods Pro in October 2019.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/airpods-3-production-rumor/\">New AirPods Expected to Launch in Third Quarter as Production Gets Underway</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-expected-to-launch-in-third-quarter-as-production-gets-underway.2289574/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=u_v25Nq_G1o:KvPiwkTYBLo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=u_v25Nq_G1o:KvPiwkTYBLo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/u_v25Nq_G1o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"410d49d0ea959f8698d0d921fcd36265281c0cbfcfc09672fb4803a6566e1e8e","category":"Apple"}
