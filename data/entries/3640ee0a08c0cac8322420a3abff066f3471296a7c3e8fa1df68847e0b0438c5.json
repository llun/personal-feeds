That's no surprise, as it's the feature film directorial debut of Lisa Joy, co-creator (with husband Jonathan Nolan) of HBO's critically acclaimed series <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/westworld/\"><em>Westworld</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Per the official premise:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman), a private investigator of the mind, navigates the darkly alluring world of the past by helping his clients access lost memories. Living on the fringes of the sunken Miami coast, his life is forever changed when he takes on a new client, Mae (Rebecca Ferguson). A simple matter of lost and found becomes a dangerous obsession. As Bannister fights to find the truth about Mae's disappearance, he uncovers a violent conspiracy and must ultimately answer the question: how far would you go to hold on to the ones you love?</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nerdist.com/article/reminiscence-trailer-hugh-jackman/\">During a virtual event</a> on Wednesday, Joy said she was inspired to make <em>Reminiscence</em> after finding an old photograph among her grandfather's belongings. The picture was of an unknown woman her grandfather had never mentioned to anyone in the family. \"It made me start to think about memory and our lives in general,\" she said. \"And the moments that maybe pass by, and maybe disappear—they don't stay with us, those connections necessarily—but that meant something, that changed us and touched us. And how nice it would be able to go back to these memories fully for a moment, to live that life and feel the way you felt when you experienced them.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769554#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769554&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3640ee0a08c0cac8322420a3abff066f3471296a7c3e8fa1df68847e0b0438c5","category":"Tech"}
