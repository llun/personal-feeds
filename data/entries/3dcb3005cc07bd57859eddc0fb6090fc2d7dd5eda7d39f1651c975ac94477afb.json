{"title":"Heads Up – AWS News Blog RSS Feed Change","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/heads-up-aws-news-blog-rss-feed-change/","date":1623775794000,"content":"<p>TL;DR – If you are using the ancient Feedburner feed for this blog, please change to the new one (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/feed/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/feed/</a>) ASAP.</p> \n<p>Back in the early days of AWS, I paid a visit to the Chicago headquarters of a cool startup called FeedBurner. My friend <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mshobe/\">Matt Shobe</a> demo’ed their new product to me and showed me how “burning” a raw RSS feed could add value to it in various ways. Upon my return to Seattle I promptly burned the RSS feed of the original (TypePad-hosted) version of this blog, and shared that feed for many years.</p> \n<p>FeedBurner has served us well over the years, but its time has passed. The company was acquired many years ago and the new owners are now putting the product into <a href=\"https://support.google.com/feedburner/answer/10483501\">maintenance mode</a>.</p> \n<p>While the existing feed will continue to work for the foreseeable future, I would like to encourage you to use the one directly generated by this blog instead. Simply update your feed reader to refer to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/feed/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/feed/</a> .</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Jeff Barr","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"3dcb3005cc07bd57859eddc0fb6090fc2d7dd5eda7d39f1651c975ac94477afb","category":"Tech"}
