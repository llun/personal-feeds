With systems offline to contain the threat, the company's pipeline system is inoperative. The system delivers approximately 45 percent of the East Coast's petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel.</p>\n<p>Colonial Pipeline issued a <a href=\"https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption\">statement</a> Sunday saying that the US Department of Energy is leading the US federal government response to the attack. \"[L]eading, third-party cybersecurity experts\" engaged by Colonial Pipeline itself are also on the case. The company's four main pipelines are still down, but it has begun restoring service to smaller lateral lines between terminals and delivery points as it determines how to safely restart its systems and restore full functionality.</p>\n<p>Colonial Pipeline has not publicly said what was demanded of it or how the demand was made.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763760#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763760&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd96b6e572511948e4dc0ed4a78b0880f3edd49973e20efa54246ed04bc9129e","category":"Tech"}
