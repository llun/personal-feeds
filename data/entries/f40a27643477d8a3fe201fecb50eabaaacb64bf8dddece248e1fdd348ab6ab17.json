The ‌Find My‌ network can detect Bluetooth signals from a lost AirTag and relay the location back to its owner.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEach AirTag is priced at $29, with a pack of four available for $99. ‌AirTags‌ can be purchased starting at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time on April 23.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/airtag-u1-chip-precision-finding/\">AirTag Includes U1 Chip for 'Precision Finding' Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-includes-u1-chip-for-precision-finding-feature.2292388/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BgebaVYKvXk:pCh8E22w8E4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BgebaVYKvXk:pCh8E22w8E4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BgebaVYKvXk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f40a27643477d8a3fe201fecb50eabaaacb64bf8dddece248e1fdd348ab6ab17","category":"Apple"}
