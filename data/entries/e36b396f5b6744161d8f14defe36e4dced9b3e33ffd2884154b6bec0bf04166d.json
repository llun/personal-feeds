Sure, it sounds like an indie riff on <em>The Matrix</em>, and there are a few shared elements, but <em>Bliss</em> is markedly different in theme and tone, and it is very much Cahill's unique vision.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers below the gallery. We'll give you a heads up when we get there.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/owen-wilson-must-choose-between-real-and-fantasy-worlds-in-bliss-trailer/\">we've reported</a> previously, Cahill also directed the 2011 indie sci-fi film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Earth\"><em>Another Earth</em></a>—his first feature—which received a standing ovation at its premiere and won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Cahill's 2014 followup feature, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Origins\"><em>I Origins</em></a>, also snagged the Sloan Prize; in fact, he's the only director to have twice won the award, so he's got some serious indie sci-fi film street cred. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741983#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741983&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e36b396f5b6744161d8f14defe36e4dced9b3e33ffd2884154b6bec0bf04166d","category":"Tech"}
