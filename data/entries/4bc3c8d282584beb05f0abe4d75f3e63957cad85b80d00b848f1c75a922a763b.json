Never, the UCI informed us that the handlebar would not be allowed. The UCI has also seen no need to accept the offer of the developer of the ABB handlebar to further investigate the admissibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“On the morning before the start of the third stage, we even discussed our intentions to ride with the handlebar with the UCI commissaire on site. Here we got the green light to start with the ABB. The UCI has not made any reservations about this. BEAT believes that the disqualification is unjustified and that Jan-Willem van Schip is seriously affected.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/real-world-aero-testing-which-hand-positions-are-fastest/\">Read more: Which hand positions are fastest? &gt;&gt;&gt; </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why now? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/uci-reiterates-ban-on-invisible-aero-bars/\">updated a number of rules</a> relating to hand position earlier this spring, at the same time it banned the Supertuck, among other changes. Those new rules banned “invisible aero bars” and deemed that the only three points of contact between bicycle and rider would be the hands on the bars, pedals, and saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rule states: “The rider shall normally assume a sitting position on the bicycle. This position requires that the only points of support are the following: the feet on the pedals, the hands on the handlebars and the seat on the saddle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of the ABB bars creates an additional point of contact at the forearms, a position that is expressly forbidden in the UCI’s technical documentation. In fact, the UCI even used an image of the bars in a recent technical presentation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-1.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn’t explain why Van Schip was given permission to run the bars by a UCI commissaire on the very morning of his disqualification, of course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Schip <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/12/the-speeco-aero-breakaway-bar-is-ultrafast-and-ultra-weird/\">helped develop the Speeco bars</a> and has long been a fan of ultra-narrow bars in road racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>CyclingTips has reached out to the UCI for comment but has not yet received a response. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is developing, check back for more. </em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/van-schip-disqualified-for-use-of-speeco-handlebars/\">Van Schip disqualified for use of Speeco handlebars</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4bc3c8d282584beb05f0abe4d75f3e63957cad85b80d00b848f1c75a922a763b","category":"Cycling"}
