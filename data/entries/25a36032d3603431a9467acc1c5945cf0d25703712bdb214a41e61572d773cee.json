It’s a result that seals the Manx Missile’s comeback, and stirs the debate over Tour de France selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish was a late replacement for an injured Sam Bennett at the Baloise Belgium Tour in a team built around the Irishman and Remco Evenepoel. Even without their marquee sprinter, Deceuninck-QuickStep come away with two stage wins, overall victory for Evenepoel and a headache for team boss Patrick Lefevere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/sam-bennett-unsure-about-the-tour-de-france-will-cavendish-replace-him/\">Lefevere revealed</a> that Bennett’s participation in the Tour is in doubt due to a knee injury picked up in training, a huge blow to the 2020 green jersey winner. Fabio Jakobsen would usually be the man to fill the void, but he’s still recovering from the injuries sustained at last year’s Tour of Poland. As for Cavendish, he was apparently not in the picture, in part due to his minimum contract, but there could now be an opening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish took his <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/mark-cavendish-gets-his-first-win-since-2018/\">first victory since 2018</a> in April at the Tour of Turkey, but the field in that race was not considered as strong as that of the Baloise Belgium Tour. Merlier, in particular, has been on a tear this season, with six wins already. Ewan recently won two stages of the Giro and has two stage wins in Belgium this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lefevere previously indicated that he and Cavendish might sit down to talk contract renewal in advance of the Tour. Cavendish’s presence at the Tour does of course depend on the condition of Sam Bennett, who is due to return to training this week. With the Tour de France now less than two weeks away, this story will keep developing over the coming days.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/cavendish-proves-he-can-still-beat-the-worlds-best/\">Cavendish proves he can still beat the world’s best</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"25a36032d3603431a9467acc1c5945cf0d25703712bdb214a41e61572d773cee","category":"Cycling"}
