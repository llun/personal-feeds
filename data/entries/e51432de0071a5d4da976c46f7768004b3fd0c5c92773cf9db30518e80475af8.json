The scores are intended to inform customers about \"whether this product is repairable, difficult to repair or unrepairable,\" according to the French Ministry of Ecological Transition.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models have been given a score of 6.0, while the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> and 11 Pro score considerably worse at 4.6. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/\">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/\">iPhone XR</a> have a score of 4.5, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xs/\">iPhone XS</a> and XS Max and have a score of 4.7 and 4.6 respectively.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBetter ratings are held by the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> with 6.2 and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 7 Plus, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 Plus with 6.6. The overall top-rated model is the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 7, with a repairability score of 6.7.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor Macs, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> 13-inch MacBook Pro has a score of 5.6, the 16-inch MacBook Pro has a score of 6.3, and the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> does best at 6.5.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA French <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/fr-fr/circular-economy-repairability-indices\">Apple Support page</a> sets out the repairability score information for a range of iPhones and MacBooks, with breakdowns justifying why each device has been designated its rating. The criteria include the availability of repair documentation, ease of disassembly, availability and price of spare parts, and software updates.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple determines these ratings against a grid offered by the Ministry of Ecological Transition, as opposed to a central regulatory authority, but they are overseen and verified by the Fraud Prevention Directorate (FRCCB).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn November last year, the European Union <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/27/european-parliament-supports-right-to-repair/\">voted to support</a> a motion on the Right to Repair, including a system of mandatory labeling on consumer electronics to provide explicit information on the repairability and lifespan of products. Laws compelling tech companies to display repairability scores for their devices, much like those in France, could come into effect across the entire EU as a result.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/\">France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/\">Right to Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/apple-rolls-out-device-repairability-scores-france/\">Apple Rolls Out Device Repairability Scores in France</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rolls-out-device-repairability-scores-in-france.2286316/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=F5GpeFOeP9M:9uPEYsn81bQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=F5GpeFOeP9M:9uPEYsn81bQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/F5GpeFOeP9M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e51432de0071a5d4da976c46f7768004b3fd0c5c92773cf9db30518e80475af8","category":"Apple"}
