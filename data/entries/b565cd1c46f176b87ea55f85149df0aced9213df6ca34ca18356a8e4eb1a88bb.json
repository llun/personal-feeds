{"title":"The Information: Apple in Early Talks With NFL for ‘Sunday Ticket’ Streaming Rights","link":"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-in-early-talks-with-nfl-on-sunday-ticket-games","date":1625858426000,"content":"\n<p>Sahil Patel, reporting for The Information:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The iPhone maker is one of a number of companies, including TV\nnetworks and other tech firms, that have had discussions with NFL\nexecutives lately about the package of games, including at this\nweek’s Allen &amp; Co. conference in Sun Valley for tech and media\nexecutives. The rights cover a package known as Sunday Ticket,\nwhich now airs on DirecTV. They are separate from a slew of\nlicensing deals recently completed between the NFL, most major\nbroadcast TV networks and Amazon. ESPN’s parent Disney is among\nthose likely to be interested in Sunday Ticket.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sunday Ticket is no small thing. It’s not like the deal Amazon has had for a few years where they have the streaming rights for a small handful of Thursday night games. Sunday Ticket packages include <em>all</em> games — it’s a super premium tier for big fans and sports bars that want to show every game.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like TV+ is following an interesting trajectory: slowly and steadily building into a unique premium TV service. Some sort of major foray into live sports seems like a good next step.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/09/information-nfl-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b565cd1c46f176b87ea55f85149df0aced9213df6ca34ca18356a8e4eb1a88bb","category":"Tech"}
