{"title":"Claim Chowder: Google Duplex","link":"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/05/11/duplex-skepticism","date":1622582226000,"content":"\n<p>Three years ago Google announced a service called Duplex at their I/O conference. They also played purported demos of Duplex in action. I was highly skeptical, and cast doubt that the demos Google offered were legitimate. A <em>lot</em> of people gave me a <em>lot</em> of shit about my skepticism.</p>\n\n<p>In a follow-up post, after Google provided a handful of journalists with a very limited hands-on demo, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/06/google_demos_duplex\">I wrote</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Right now it feels like a feature in search of a product, but they\npitched it as an imminent product at I/O because it made for a\nstunning demo. (It remains the only thing announced at I/O that\nanyone is talking about.) If what Google really wanted was just\nfor Google Assistant to be able to make restaurant reservations,\nthey’d be better off building an OpenTable competitor and giving\nit away to all these small businesses that don’t yet offer online\nreservations. I’m not holding my breath for Duplex ever to allow\nanyone to make a reservation at any establishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Three years later and I’m still not holding my breath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently Duplex <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-google-duplex-869476/\"><em>has</em> launched</a>, but it’s unclear how often the AI system — not human operators — make the phone calls. Would love to hear some recordings of this in action.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/01/duplex-claim-chowder\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cf5776f39d5775d7717c3aab0df0de2637c165a40899a17317a8c9f34788671e","category":"Tech"}
