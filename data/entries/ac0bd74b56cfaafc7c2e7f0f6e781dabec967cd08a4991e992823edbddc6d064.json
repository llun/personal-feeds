Even with the unprecedented amount of RAM on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, developers are reportedly severely limited in the amount they can actually use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPosted by the developer behind the graphic and design app Artstudio Pro on the <a href=\"https://folio.procreate.art/discussions/4/10/46740\">Procreate Forum</a>, apps can only use 5GB of RAM on the new â€ŒM1â€Œ â€ŒiPadâ€Œ Pros. According to the developer, attempting to use anymore will cause the app to crash. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>There is a big problem with â€ŒM1â€Œ â€ŒiPad Proâ€Œ. After making stress test and other tests on new â€ŒM1â€Œ â€ŒiPad Proâ€Œ with 16GB or RAM, it turned out that app can use ONLY 5GB or RAM! If we allocate more, app crashes. It is only 0.5GB more that in old iPads with 6GB of RAM! I suppose it isn't better on â€ŒiPadâ€Œ with 8GB.</blockquote>Following the release of its M1-optimized app, Procreate also noted on Twitter that with either 8GB or 16GB of available RAM, the app is limited by the amount of RAM it can use.\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>As of now, all â€ŒM1â€Œ iPads have the same amount of RAM available. As soon as we have access to more, weâ€™ll pass that on to you, too ðŸ’œ</p>â€” Procreate (@Procreate) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Procreate/status/1398087071005233152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2021</a></blockquote> \r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe previous maximum RAM in an â€ŒiPadâ€Œ was last year's â€ŒiPad Proâ€Œ which featured 6GB of RAM, regardless of storage configuration. Given, a 5GB limit on apps imposed by iPadOS wouldn't necessarily ring any alarm bells as developers would have access to the majority of the available memory. Although, with the â€ŒM1â€Œ â€ŒiPad Proâ€Œ, developers cannot tap the full potential of the available hardware.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe added RAM, especially in the higher-end 1TB and 2TB models, will still benefit the user by allowing them to keep more apps open in the background. iPadOS itself can access the â€ŒM1â€Œ's entire pool of unified memory, while apps can reportedly only access 5GB of it. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nâ€ŒiPadâ€Œ users <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/m1-ipad-pro/\">have long voiced the mantra</a> that iPadOS doesn't take full advantage of the available hardware and potential of the â€ŒiPad Proâ€Œ, and now thanks to the â€ŒM1â€Œ chip inside of the â€ŒiPad Proâ€Œ, that's certainly more of a case. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 7, where it's expected to announce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, watchOS 8, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS 12</a>, tvOS 15, and iPadOS 15. <em>Bloomberg</em> has reported that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/bloomberg-apple-plans-imessage-upgrades/\">iPadOS 15 will include the biggest redesign to the iPad homescreen since the iPad first launched</a>, including the ability for users to place <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a> anywhere on the grid.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've contacted Apple for clarification regarding the amount of RAM apps can access and will update this post if we hear back.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/ipados-limits-app-ram-even-on-m1-ipad-pro/\">Apps Reportedly Limited to Maximum of 5GB RAM in iPadOS, Even With 16GB M1 iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apps-reportedly-limited-to-maximum-of-5gb-ram-in-ipados-even-with-16gb-m1-ipad-pro.2298229/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WKwFeWD_4PI:Yk8vJqTS9Y4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WKwFeWD_4PI:Yk8vJqTS9Y4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/WKwFeWD_4PI\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ac0bd74b56cfaafc7c2e7f0f6e781dabec967cd08a4991e992823edbddc6d064","category":"Apple"}
