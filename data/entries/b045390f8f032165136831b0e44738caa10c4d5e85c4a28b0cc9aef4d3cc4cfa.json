(credit: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/author/aurich-lawson/\">Aurich Lawson</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Friday afternoon, the OpenZFS project <a href=\"https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.1.0\">released</a> version 2.1.0 of our perennial favorite \"it's complicated but worth it\" filesystem. The new release is compatible with FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE and up and Linux kernels 3.10-5.13. This release offers several general performance improvements, as well as a few entirely new features—mostly targeting enterprise and other extremely advanced use cases.</p>\n<p>Today, we're going to focus on arguably the biggest feature OpenZFS 2.1.0 adds—the dRAID vdev topology. dRAID has been under active development since at least 2015 and reached beta status when <a href=\"https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/commit/b2255edcc0099e62ad46a3dd9d64537663c6aee3\">merged</a> into OpenZFS master in November 2020. Since then, it's been heavily tested in several major OpenZFS development shops—meaning today's release is \"new\" to production status, not \"new\" as in untested.</p>\n<h2>Distributed RAID (dRAID) overview</h2>\n<p>If you already thought ZFS topology was a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/05/zfs-101-understanding-zfs-storage-and-performance/\">complex</a> topic, get ready to have your mind blown. Distributed RAID (dRAID) is an entirely new vdev topology we first encountered in a presentation at the 2016 OpenZFS Dev Summit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777983#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777983&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b045390f8f032165136831b0e44738caa10c4d5e85c4a28b0cc9aef4d3cc4cfa","category":"Tech"}
