This all follows a mix-up at a manufacturing facility in Baltimore, according to multiple media reports.</p>\n<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson had partnered with Emergent BioSolutions to manufacture the active ingredient of its vaccine. But according to two US officials who spoke with Politico, workers at the West Baltimore facility <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/johnson-johnson-vaccine-15-million-ruined-478776\">mixed up the ingredients in Johnson &amp;Johnson’s vaccine</a> with those for a different coronavirus vaccine. Emergent BioSolutions is also <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-mixup.html\">a manufacturing partner of AstraZeneca</a>, according to The New York Times, which first reported the problem.</p>\n<p>The mishap with Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine began before the Food and Drug Administration had authorized the facility to produce the vaccine. Now, that authorization has been delayed, and shipments are stalled.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753642#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753642&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aeeacfbb26c9f3f3317696b71222a0350be39a74b5fab7793c1425efe1115e1f","category":"Tech"}
