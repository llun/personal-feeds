Lucyd Lyte didn't quite impress—mostly because their tiny built-in speakers are nearly as audible to everyone around you as they are to you. Today, we'll take a look at two models of bone-conduction headphones suggested to us in that review's comment section—the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AWUC7q\" target=\"_blank\">AfterShokz Titanium</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wvAIgl\" target=\"_blank\">AfterShokz Air</a>.</p>\n<p>I purchased one each of the Titanium and Air in early March and have used them regularly in the months since. Bone-conduction headphones are definitely not for everyone—but they're fantastic for people who need the particular mix of comfort, awareness of surroundings, and improved hygiene they offer.</p>\n<h2>Open, comfortable ears</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/front-view-980x681.jpg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          Aftershokz headphones disappear pretty effectively on most users' heads—despite hair ranging from quite short (pictured) to outright crew cut (current), my family rarely notices when mine are on.
