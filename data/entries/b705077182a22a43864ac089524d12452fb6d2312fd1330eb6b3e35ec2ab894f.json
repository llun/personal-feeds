They can operate for far longer than human-occupied vehicles, go into areas where risk would dictate people avoid, and reach depths where very few craft can take a human. But even so, a lot of the hardware gets taken up by an enclosure that's capable of protecting things like batteries and electronics from the pressures of the deep.</p>\n<p>But that may not be entirely necessary, based on a report in today's Nature. In it, a team of Chinese researchers describe adapting hardware so that it could operate a soft-bodied robot in the deep ocean. The researchers then gave the robot a ride 10 kilometers down in the Mariana Trench and showed that it worked.</p>\n<h2>Going soft</h2>\n<p>Mention robots, and for many people, the first thing that comes to mind are the collections of metal and cabling that make up things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw\">the dancing Atlases</a> from Boston Dynamics. But over the last decade, plenty of researchers have demonstrated that all that rigid hardware isn't strictly necessary. Soft-bodied robots work, too, and can do interesting things like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/11/robot-without-a-skeleton-inspired-by-squid-crawls-on-land/\">squeeze through tight spaces</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/07/robot-made-to-swim-using-light-activated-heart-muscle-cells/\">incorporate living cells</a> into their structure.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746922#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746922&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b705077182a22a43864ac089524d12452fb6d2312fd1330eb6b3e35ec2ab894f","category":"Tech"}
