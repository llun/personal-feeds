{"title":"iPad Pro With Thunderbolt and Mini-LED Display Coming 'As Early As April'","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/","date":1616018328000,"content":"Apple will introduce new iPads as early as April, according to a new report shared today by <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/apple-nears-launch-of-new-ipads-after-stay-at-home-sales-boost\">Bloomberg</a></em>. The April date comes following incorrect rumors that Apple planned to hold an event on March 23.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/iPad-Pro-Mini-LED-yellow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-768062\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple will refresh its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> lineup, introducing new models that \"look similar to the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Pros\" in the same 11 and 12.9-inch screen sizes. The two iPads are expected to feature an updated A14X processor that's \"on par\" with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, along with better cameras. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA mini-LED display will be included with \"at least\" the larger 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, with the display upgrade bringing improved brightness and contrast ratios. This is in line with many rumors that we've heard previously, and most of the information suggests the upgraded display technology will be limited to the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has tested &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros with a Thunderbolt connector that would make them compatible with additional external monitors, hard drives, and peripherals, plus it brings faster data syncing speeds. Apple's Mac machines have featured Thunderbolt technology for years now, but current &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models have standard USB-C ports. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLater this year, Apple plans to refresh its cheapest &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Apple is also working on a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> with a larger display.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere was a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">lot of chatter</a> suggesting Apple would hold a March event to introduce new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3, and perhaps <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, but those rumors were never confirmed by a reliable source like <em>Bloomberg</em> or Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. With &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models launching in April and the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 now set for the third-quarter of 2021 based on rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">from earlier this week</a>, it looks like there will be no March announcement. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/\">iPad Pro With Thunderbolt and Mini-LED Display Coming &#039;As Early As April&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-with-thunderbolt-and-mini-led-display-coming-as-early-as-april.2288689/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hmYwSAyfrLQ:VR486rO1thE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hmYwSAyfrLQ:VR486rO1thE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hmYwSAyfrLQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7390a4587e8990759ba523db05c9b05160d8ed7c7d27d5285abc31f94bd003eb","category":"Apple"}
