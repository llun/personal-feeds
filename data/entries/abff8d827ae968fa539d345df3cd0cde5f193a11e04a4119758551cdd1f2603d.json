Now it has an electric alternative, called the EQS.                      [credit:\n                        Mercedes-EQ                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>You can tell there should have been an international auto show this week by the flurry of new car announcements. These announcements have already included new battery electric vehicles from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/mazdas-electric-mx-30-goes-on-sale-in-the-us-this-fall/\">Mazda</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/everything-we-know-about-audis-next-electric-crossover-the-q4-e-tron/\">Audi</a>, as well as a little Hyundai truck that seems to have impressed many. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz has taken the wraps off an electric alternative to its mighty flagship S-Class. Actually, let me correct that—it's the first car from a new sub-brand, called Mercedes-EQ, and the car is called the EQS. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/the-new-mercedes-benz-eqc-electric-suv-goes-on-sale-in-2020/\">And unlike the EQC crossover</a>, this one is definitely going on sale here in the US.</p>\n<p>Do not mistake this car for an S-Class with a battery pack and some electric motors instead of an engine and transmission. Although the two cars share technology, the EQS uses a purpose-designed BEV architecture that we'll see in other, probably more modest Mercedes-EQs. Over in the conventionally powered world, the S-Class has for decades been the car to beat for the title of \"World's Best,\" and the EQS is sticking to that playbook.</p>\n<p>The EQS has a drag coefficient that might make <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/everything-we-know-about-the-lucid-air-electric-vehicle/\">a Lucid Air</a> driver wonder if someone left a window open. It has a range far in excess of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/tesla-cuts-model-s-price-by-5000-bumps-range-to-402-miles/\">a Tesla Model S Long Range</a>. It can regenerate more braking energy <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-porsches-new-electric-car/\">than a Porsche Taycan Turbo S</a>. And the dashboard has been replaced by 56 inches of AI-enhanced data screens. Oh, and did I mention the doors close themselves?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757396#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757396&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
