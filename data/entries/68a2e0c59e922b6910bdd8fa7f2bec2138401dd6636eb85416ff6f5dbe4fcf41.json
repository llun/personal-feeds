{"title":"Final Cut Pro Trademark Update Suggests Apple Eyeing Future Subscription Model","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/final-cut-pro-subscription/","date":1614169437000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/final-cut-pro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"234\" height=\"226\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-785369\" />Apple has amended its trademark for Final Cut Pro, its professional high-end video editing software, in a way that suggests it could be planning to turn the now one-time payment model for the software into a subscription.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs reported by <em><a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/02/apple-files-an-update-to-their-final-cut-pro-trademark-opening-the-door-for-software-as-a-service-saas-via-cloud-subscr.html\">Patently Apple</a></em>, on Monday, Apple added a Nice Classification #42 listing to its Final Cut Pro trademark in Europe. The Class 42 identification is <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/classifications/nice/nclpub/en/fr/?basic_numbers=show&class_number=42&explanatory_notes=show&lang=en&menulang=en&mode=flat&notion=&pagination=no&version=20210101\">listed</a> as including software as a service (SaaS), or a platform as a service (PaaS). For context, Microsoft Office 365, which is based on a monthly or yearly subscription, includes the same Class 42 listing for its suite of software.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFinal Cut Pro is currently sold for &#36;300 and is used widely by professional videographers, YouTubers, and content makers. Potentially changing the price and payment model into a monthly, or yearly subscription could entice even more customers to use the software. If Apple is planning the subscription route, it'll likely include more than simply the software itself.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/6a0120a5580826970c0263e9925784200b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1106\" height=\"494\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785364\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith a subscription, Apple theoretically could offer subscribers access to original content, such as in-depth tutorials, walkthroughs, or exclusive videos/sessions with prominent video makers who use Final Cut Pro as part of their workflow.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhether Apple takes the route is unknown, however, the pure nature of the updated trademark is rather telling. Apple over the years has launched a number of new services, the most recent being Apple Fitness+. The momentum is not slowing down, however. Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-podcast-subscription-service/\">reportedly</a> eyeing to launch a new podcast subscription service that would offer listeners exclusive and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/21/apple-exclusive-original-podcast-content/\">original content</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/final-cut-pro/\">Final Cut Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patentlyapple-com/\">patentlyapple.com</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/final-cut-pro-subscription/\">Final Cut Pro Trademark Update Suggests Apple Eyeing Future Subscription Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-cut-pro-trademark-update-suggests-apple-eyeing-future-subscription-model.2286010/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3X76d4NjFt8:UicE12pC-VA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3X76d4NjFt8:UicE12pC-VA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3X76d4NjFt8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"68a2e0c59e922b6910bdd8fa7f2bec2138401dd6636eb85416ff6f5dbe4fcf41","category":"Apple"}
