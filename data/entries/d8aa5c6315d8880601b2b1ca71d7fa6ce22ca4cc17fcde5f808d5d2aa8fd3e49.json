The pair will \"team up on a global adventure that tests their abilities—and their patience.\"</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for prior MCU films below.)</strong></p>\n<p>You may recall that after the Avengers and their many allies finally defeated Thanos in <em>Endgame</em>, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) handed over his shield to Sam so he could take on the mantle. But will Sam accept it? That's part of what <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> will explore over the course of its six episodes, and showrunner Malcolm Spellman has said the tone will be similar to <em>Captain America: Winter Soldier</em>. Marvel is purportedly spending in the range of $25 million per episode to ensure a cinematic quality for the series.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740382#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740382&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8aa5c6315d8880601b2b1ca71d7fa6ce22ca4cc17fcde5f808d5d2aa8fd3e49","category":"Tech"}
