Once the profile is in place, the watchOS 7.5 beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> by going to General &gt; Software Update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe don't yet know what's included in watchOS 7.5, but it could include bug fixes for issues that aren't included in the watchOS 7.4 update. There were no new features discovered in the first beta, but we'll update this article should we find anything new in the second beta.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/apple-seeds-watchos-7-5-beta-2-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 7.5 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-watchos-7-5-to-developers.2294149/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lM5VRrATX9M:fR0vO5nXXO8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lM5VRrATX9M:fR0vO5nXXO8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lM5VRrATX9M\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d552559218d5257669432e4f40843e3071b4d3b560d0a14428e98611d278eaed","category":"Apple"}
