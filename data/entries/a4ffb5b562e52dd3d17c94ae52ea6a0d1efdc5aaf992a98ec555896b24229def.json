The design mirrors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/\">previously leaked images</a> suggesting that Apple is returning to the glossy finish for the ‌Apple Pencil‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther reports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/apple-pencil-3-again-rumored/\">from the leaker \"Uncle Pan Pan,\"</a> who seemingly leaked the entire <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/iphone-12-magesafe-case-spring-colors/\">spring range of iPhone cases</a>, have also said that Apple is actively preparing to launch the third-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not clear what new features may be coming to the new ‌Apple Pencil‌, but it seems that upgrades may be more focused on the internals of the accessory rather than any significant external design changes. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to expect some added functionality over the current model to justify a new iteration of the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe leaked video serves as yet another indication that the launch of the third-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌ is imminent and will likely be announced at the \"Spring Loaded\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a> next week alongside new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/video-of-third-generation-apple-pencil/\">Video of Alleged Third-Generation Apple Pencil Leaks Ahead of Apple Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-of-alleged-third-generation-apple-pencil-leaks-ahead-of-apple-event.2291905/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=i8D8G71dLGM:rCkljoanPu0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=i8D8G71dLGM:rCkljoanPu0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/i8D8G71dLGM\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4ffb5b562e52dd3d17c94ae52ea6a0d1efdc5aaf992a98ec555896b24229def","category":"Apple"}
