The new lineup features refreshed models with Tiger Lake CPUs for Inspiron 13, 14, 14 2-in-1, and 15 laptops—and a brand-new Inspiron 16 Plus.</p>\n<p>If you're not familiar with Dell branding, Inspiron is <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8984087-12578053?sid=ArsDellInspiron2021&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fsr%2Flaptops%2Finspiron-laptops\" target=\"_blank\">its budget laptop lineup</a>—but in this context, \"budget\" means solid laptop designs targeted to price-sensitive customers, but not bottom-of-the-barrel cheap stuff. You'll find the same Intel i3, i5, and i7 CPUs in these Inspiron models as you'd find in more expensive Dell Latitudes, HP Probooks, and so forth.</p>\n<h2>2021 Inspiron 13</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Inspiron-13_top_keyboard_1280x1280-980x980.jpeg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          The Inspiron 13 has the compressed arrow-key layout we know you all love, along with what appears to be a somewhat undersized Enter key. Power button is on the top right, just above backspace.

The Inspiron features a 13.3-inch display in 1920x1200 or 2560x1600 16:10 resolution, and it comes with a choice of Intel i3-1125G4, i5-11300H, or 17-11370H CPU, and (on the i5 and i7 models) an optional Nvidia GeForce MX450 GPU. Weight starts at 1.25 kg (2.75 lb)—we're not shown a full range of weights, but we don't see any options that should plump things up much, either.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756856#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756856&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d68e0671e7641d432dec8ae5297eaed28a403a01fd76f27325be4fb2ee3e4f2","category":"Tech"}
