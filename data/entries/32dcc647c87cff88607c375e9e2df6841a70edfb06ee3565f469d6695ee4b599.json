The issue in question involved a restriction on\nthe customer’s Apple ID that disabled App Store and iTunes\npurchases and subscription services, excluding iCloud. Apple\nprovided an instant credit for the purchase of a new MacBook Pro,\nand as part of that agreement, the customer was to return their\ncurrent unit to us. No matter what payment method was used, the\nability to transact on the associated Apple ID was disabled\nbecause Apple could not collect funds. This is entirely unrelated\nto Apple Card.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like a more reasonable situation than it first appeared, but, still, good to know that this is how it works.</p>\n\n<p>The heart of Curtis’s saga is that he got instant credit for an old MacBook, didn’t sent it back to Apple on time, <em>and</em> changed the bank account backing his credit card so Apple’s chargeback for the device trade-in didn’t take. When I, or family members, have sent devices in for trade-in (iPhones, usually), we haven’t been credited for the trade-in until after Apple has acknowledged receiving the old device.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Clarifies When It Locks Your Apple ID Because You Owe Them Money’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/03/apple-id-locked\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"32dcc647c87cff88607c375e9e2df6841a70edfb06ee3565f469d6695ee4b599","category":"Tech"}
