With similar geometry to the existing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/canyon-grail-cf-sl-7-0-review/\">Grail</a>, the Grizl ups tyre clearances and adds mounts for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking bags</a> and accessories.</p>\n<p>Most notably, it features a standard drop handlebar, eschewing the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/so-whats-the-deal-with-canyons-unique-new-hover-bar/\">Grail’s unique double-decker cockpit design</a>.</p>\n<p>Pricing is competitive with the new Grizl starting at £2,199 / $2,099 / €1,999 for the Grizl CF SL 6 with Shimano GRX RX400 components, and topping out at £4,999 / $4,799 / €4,599 for the Grizl CF SLX 8 Di2 with Shimano GRX Di2.

All the same, there will be far fewer headaches when it comes to fitting accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\" target=\"_blank\">lights</a> and bar bags and, if you want to adjust your fit, you can change stem lengths without replacing the entire cockpit because it isn’t a one-piece design.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Big clearances and mounts are the order of the day here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wil Matthews / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Key selling points of the Grizl are its clearances – it accepts 50mm tyres, or 45mm with mudguards – and its array of mounting bosses.</p>\n<p>There are mounts for three <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\" target=\"_blank\">bottle cages</a> (two on CF SLX models – the third is lost to an internal Di2 battery mount), a top tube bag, two cargo cages on the fork, and Canyon’s own mudguards.</p>\n<p>In keeping with the adventurous theme, Canyon will be offering a collection of frame bags designed in collaboration with Apidura.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon has collaborated with Apidura to produce a dedicated set of lightweight bikepacking bags.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Roo Fowler / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<h2>The many shades of gravel</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon is targeting the Grizl at more adventure-oriented gravel riders.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tal Vardi / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>According to Canyon, there’s no such thing as the perfect <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Gravel covers a huge spectrum of riding styles from road bikes that can dabble on dirt, to actual cross-country mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>While the Grail sits in the all-road slash “light gravel” area, Canyon places the Grizl in the “rough gravel” category, overlapping with the tamer end of mountain biking.</p>\n<p>Canyon says it’s discovered the joys of “underbiking”, i.e. pushing the limits of the kind of terrain you’re prepared to tackle.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">geometry</a> terms, the Grizl is very, very similar to the Grail, adopting the same combination of long reach, short stem and wide bar that works so well for improving control when riding off-road.</p>\n<p>The added clearances and other tweaks have stretched the wheelbase by 8mm on a size medium.</p>\n<p>Taking into account stems lengths, Canyon says the effective reach is identical to that of the Endurace, while the effective stack is very slightly lower for a more aggressive position, but not as racy as the Ultimate road bike’s.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th></th><th>2XS</th><th>XS</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th><th>2XL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seat tube (mm)</td><td>432</td><td>462</td><td>492</td><td>522</td><td>552</td><td>582</td><td>612</td>        </tr><tr><td>Top tube (mm)</td><td>532</td><td>541</td><td>562</td><td>574</td><td>588</td><td>612</td><td>627</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube (mm)</td><td>121</td><td>133</td><td>118</td><td>138</td><td>164</td><td>185</td><td>204</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head angle (°)</td><td>70</td><td>71</td><td>71</td><td>72.25</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.75</td><td>72.75</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat angle (°)</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay (mm)</td><td>420</td><td>420</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td><td>435</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>1007</td><td>1007</td><td>1036</td><td>1037</td><td>1050</td><td>1072</td><td>1086</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack (mm)</td><td>522</td><td>537</td><td>556</td><td>579</td><td>605</td><td>626</td><td>644</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>377</td><td>382</td><td>397</td><td>402</td><td>409</td><td>427</td><td>436</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stem length (mm)</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>80</td><td>90</td><td>90</td><td>100</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bar width (mm)</td><td>400</td><td>400</td><td>420</td><td>440</td><td>440</td><td>460</td><td>460</td>        </tr><tr><td>Crank length (mm)</td><td>170</td><td>170</td><td>172.5</td><td>172.5</td><td>172.5</td><td>175</td><td>175</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheel size</td><td>650b</td><td>650b</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td><td>700c</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Will Canyon discontinue the Grail?</h2>\n<p>So, is it curtains for the Grail?</p>\n<p>Not according to Canyon. The brand is positioning the Grizl as the more adventure-oriented platform, while the Grail is more in the realm of all-road riding with a more even on/off-road split.</p>\n<h2>Mountain bike-esque features and the right sized wheels</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Grizl isn’t a mountain bike, but it sits near the MTB end of the gravel spectrum.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tal Vardi / Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>According to Canyon, the Grizl CF SLX’s carbon frame weighs 950g including hardware, making it around 70g heavier than the Grail CF SLX. The Grizl CF SL is said to be around 100g heavier depending on colour scheme, and very slightly less stiff.</p>\n<p>Notable features of the Grizl include a radically dropped driveside chainstay to create those all-important clearances, and an optional front derailleur mount – Canyon is offering both 1× and 2× builds at launch.</p>\n<p>The seat clamp is a neat hidden design as used on previous Canyons and it’s situated 110mm below the top of the seat tube to allow additional seatpost movement.</p>\n<p>The frame is compatible with dropper posts and the US variant of the Grizl CF SL 8 1by includes one with 80mm of travel.</p>\n<p>Bikes will be specced with 160mm brake rotors as standard, but the frameset is designed to take 180s if you prefer – another indicator of the Grizl’s more mountain bike-adjacent intentions.</p>\n<p>Canyon is emphatic that designing a frameset to accommodate both 700c and 650b wheels is inherently a compromise, and that bigger wheels are faster.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Grizl officially only takes 700c wheels <em>except</em> for the two smallest sizes (2XS and XS), which are specifically designed around 650b to maintain consistent geometry across the size range.</p>\n<h2>Canyon Grizl specs and prices</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Canyon has got a lot bolder with its paintjobs in recent years.
