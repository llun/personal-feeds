The company has resisted the temptation to start off with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/american-excess-is-back-with-the-1000hp-2022-gmc-hummer-ev-truck/\">a bombastic SUV like General Motors' reborn GMC Hummer</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/the-porsche-taycan-every-bit-as-good-as-a-200000-porsche-should-be/\">a handsome sedan like the Porsche Taycan</a>, although those are both in the pipeline. Instead, the Ioniq brand will launch with that most in-demand of automobiles, the midsize crossover. In this case, a keenly styled crossover called the Ioniq 5, which will also be the first BEV to use Hyundai's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/08/hyundai-will-launch-three-new-electric-cars-starting-in-2021/\">new E-GMP architecture</a>.</p>\n<p>The production Ioniq 5 looks remarkably similar to the concept car that preceded it, the 45. At first glance, it appears to be channeling the boxy good looks of late-1980s hot hatches. But don't be fooled by the proportions; it's roughly the same size as Toyota's best-selling RAV4 crossover. The big 20-inch wheels and short front and rear overhangs conceal a 118-inch (3,000mm) wheelbase that translates to acres of interior room for the occupants.</p>\n<p>Beyond plenty of space and a flat floor, the interior has another surprise. The center console can slide, moving back by up to 5.5 inches (140mm). This gives the front occupants the option of leaving out the other side of the car, as well as giving rear passengers access to the console's storage, USB ports, and wireless charging pad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744353#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744353&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
