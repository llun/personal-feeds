Thompson, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A source has provided another data set, this time following the\nsmartphones of thousands of Trump supporters, rioters and\npassers-by in Washington, D.C., on January 6, as Donald Trump’s\npolitical rally turned into a violent insurrection. At least five\npeople died because of the riot at the Capitol. Key to bringing\nthe mob to justice has been the event’s digital detritus: location\ndata, geotagged photos, facial recognition, surveillance cameras\nand crowdsourcing. […]</p>\n\n<p>While there were no names or phone numbers in the data, we\nwere once again able to connect dozens of devices to their\nowners, tying anonymous locations back to names, home\naddresses, social networks and phone numbers of people in\nattendance. In one instance, three members of a single family\nwere tracked in the data.</p>\n\n<p>The source shared this information, in part, because the\nindividual was outraged by the events of Jan. 6. The source wanted\nanswers, accountability, justice. The person was also deeply\nconcerned about the privacy implications of this surreptitious\ndata collection. Not just that it happens, but also that most\nconsumers don’t know it is being collected and it is insecure and\nvulnerable to law enforcement as well as bad actors — or an\nonline mob — who might use it to inflict harm on innocent people.\n(The source asked to remain anonymous because the person was not\nauthorized to share the data and could face severe penalties for\ndoing so.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand why the source asked to remain anonymous, but it sure would be interesting to know <em>which apps</em> were supplying this data. My best guess is that it come from a mobile ad network. But that’s just a guess. And if the data did come from just one ad network, how much data is being collected in the aggregate by all ad networks?</p>\n\n<p>It’s really just flabbergasting what Warzel and Thompson were able to do with this.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘They Stormed the Capitol.
