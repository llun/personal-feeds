So I ran an\nexperiment on my own Internet-connected Samsung, as well as new\n“smart TV” models from four of the best-selling brands: Samsung,\nTCL Roku TV, Vizio and LG.</p>\n\n<p>I set up each smart TV as most people do: by tapping “OK” with the\nremote to each on-screen prompt. Then using software from\nPrinceton University called the IoT Inspector, I watched how each\nmodel transmitted data. Lots went flying from streaming apps and\ntheir advertising partners. But even when I switched to a live\nbroadcast signal, I could see each TV sending out reports as often\nas once per second.</p>\n\n<p>When tracking is active, some TVs record and send out everything\nthat crosses the pixels on your screen. It doesn’t matter whether\nthe source is cable, an app, your DVD player or streaming box.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every damn second. Disconnect your TV from the internet and use a set top box or stick with some degree of privacy you can control. Even if you’re worried about the privacy angle, it’s just a waste of bandwidth.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Smart’ TVs Track Everything You Watch’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/18/fowler-tv-privacy\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ea0357db565bcb076c321e3276a9e792f64697ed481ddc6b29fb725d29e8be14","category":"Tech"}
