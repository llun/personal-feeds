{"title":"A second year without Paris-Roubaix: Why Covid has cast the race into doubt","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/paris-roubaix-looks-set-to-be-cancelled-again","date":1616437549000,"content":"\n      <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this point, the 2021 cycling season has gone ahead with relatively few issues. This is certainly the case when compared to the 2020 campaign which was decimated due to the global pandemic. Multiple races were cancelled, including for the first time since World War II, Paris-Roubaix.</span></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-Ymj3Vm\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘The Hell of the North’ is one of cycling’s five monuments and is perhaps the most popular and prestigious one-day race in cycling. However, it now seems that we may be without Paris-Roubaix for the second successive year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paris-Roubaix was due to take place on Sunday 11th April 2021. However,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a month-long lockdown across multiple regions of France including Paris last Thursday.</span></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related – The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a> </strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking to France Bleu earlier today, Michel Lalande, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who is the prefect of the Hauts-de-France region which encompasses Roubaix was asked about Paris-Roubaix. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I'll give you an answer when the time is right, but you can guess it”, said Laland.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span>All WorldTour races have gone ahead in 2021 thus far, including Paris-Nice. Paris-Roubaix was far from the only event to fall to the pandemic last year, though. Other WorldTour events that were cancelled include the Volta Catalunya, Amstel Gold Race and the Tour de Romandie. However, the Volta Catalunya has returned to the calendar in 2021 and is taking place across the final week of March.</span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB2_5873_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616433052\" alt=\"Roubaix Velodrome 2019\"><em>Paris-Roubaix, 2019 (Alex Broadway/SWpix)</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite this news, the Belgian Classics are expected to continue as expected. When asked on this matter, Lalande responded, “<span>Someone will have to explain to me the coherence between the safety precaution for COVID. Someone will have to explain it to me.\"</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Clearly, Lalande was surprised that racing in Belgium is set to continue amidst the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were set to witness the inaugural Women’s Paris-Roubaix in 2020, yet this was delayed by a year due to the pandemic. Potential postponement of this year’s event means the first women’s Paris-Roubaix may have to wait until a later date, be it later this year or in 2022.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/gallery-milan-san-remo-2021\">Related – Milan-San Remo 2021 Gallery</a></strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step is awaiting official confirmation of the race’s postponement/cancellation which can be expected following Lalande’s comments. However, we cannot be sure whether The Hell of the North will be rearranged for a later date in 2021, or whether we will be forced to wait until 2022.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbleunord/status/1373899235633020929\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding to his earlier comments, Lalande said, “The sky now looks less blue”. Many would’ve hoped for the clouds to show themselves on the day of Paris-Roubaix, rain can often shake up the race making it more unpredictable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this sense, though, we hope that somehow the sky will remain blue and we will see Paris-Roubaix at some point this season.</span></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-UFKPji\"></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"d78468208b505fb156c2ecf244e1850d86df4984447e182a33271356a7a150b4","category":"Cycling"}
