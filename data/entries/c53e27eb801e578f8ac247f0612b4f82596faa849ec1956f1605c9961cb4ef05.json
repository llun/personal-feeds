With the exception of the three undisclosed entities, Microsoft said, the password-spraying campaign was “mostly unsuccessful.” Microsoft has since notified all targets, whether attacks were successful or not.</p>\n<h2>Enter Nobelium</h2>\n<p>The discoveries came in Microsoft’s continued investigation into Nobelium, Microsoft’s name for the sophisticated hacking group that used SolarWinds software updates and other means to compromise networks belonging to nine US agencies and 100 private companies. The federal government has said Nobelium is part of the Russian government’s Federal Security Service.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776577#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776577&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c53e27eb801e578f8ac247f0612b4f82596faa849ec1956f1605c9961cb4ef05","category":"Tech"}
