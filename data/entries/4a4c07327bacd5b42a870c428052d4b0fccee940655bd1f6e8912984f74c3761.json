Adobe plans to stop supporting the apps for existing users on January 10, 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/adobe-photoshop-sketch-ipad.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/mobile-apps/help/sketch-draw-end-of-support.html\">support document</a>, Adobe said users can easily migrate to its Fresco app, which combines many Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator Draw drawing and painting tools. All projects created in Illustrator Draw and Photoshop Sketch will be automatically migrated to Fresco after a user signs into the app with their Adobe ID email address.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nExisting users can continue to use Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator Draw after July 19, with all artwork and projects remaining available, but Adobe said it will not add any new features or updates to the apps once they are discontinued.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAdobe Fresco first launched on the iPad in 2019 and expanded to the iPhone last year.
