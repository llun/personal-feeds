{"title":"WhatsApp Ends Support for iOS 9, Now Requires iPhone 5 or Later to Work","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/whatsapp-needs-iphone-5-or-later-to-work/","date":1616061354000,"content":"As indicated in a <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/download-and-installation/about-supported-operating-systems?category=5245235\">newly published support document</a>, WhatsApp has ended support for iOS 9 and earlier versions of Apple's mobile operating system, requiring all users to be running at least iOS 10, released in 2016.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nUp until now, iOS 9 users – which will have been mainly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 4s owners – were able to use the encrypted chat service. Going forward, however, iOS 10 is required, meaning users will need an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 or later model to use WhatsApp.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe drop in support follows a similar move by the Facebook-owned instant messaging service last year, when it ended support for iOS 8 and older. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor customers finding themselves no longer being able to use the app due to the end of support, it's recommended that you back up your WhatsApp chats to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a>, and restore your chat history to a newer, supported device.
