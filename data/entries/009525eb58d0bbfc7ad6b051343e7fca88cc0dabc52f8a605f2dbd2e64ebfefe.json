Not a superstition per se, but more like a talisman. Just seems like the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<p><em>The C Programming Language</em> is a wonderfully-written book. It explains the basics of C better than anything I’ve ever seen. C is a weird, hard language but K&amp;R describe it with joy. It’s a serious book written in a conversational style.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Hello, World’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/23/hello-world\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"009525eb58d0bbfc7ad6b051343e7fca88cc0dabc52f8a605f2dbd2e64ebfefe","category":"Tech"}
