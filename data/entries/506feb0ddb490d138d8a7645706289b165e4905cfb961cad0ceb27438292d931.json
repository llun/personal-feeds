Those tyres were only available in 25mm and sold out very quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward 12 months and Continental has answered the deafening roar to make the tyre and permanent feature and introduced a 28mm option. This is good news! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new cream sidewall tyre joins the new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/01/continentals-new-gp5000-options-include-a-transparent-tan-sidewall/\">transparent option</a> Continental introduced earlier this year and the standard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/11/continental-goes-tubeless-with-new-grand-prix-5000-road-tire/\">black wall tyre</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In more good news, the construction and compound used in the cream and transparent sidewall tyres are identical to the original black GP5000, so the new tyres should retain the same performance and puncture resistance properties of the popular all-round tyre. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new cream sidewalls tyres are available now, priced at €64.90 </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.continental-tires.com/bicycle\">Continental-Tires.com</a></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/continentals-cream-sidewall-gp5000-is-back/\">Read More</a>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"506feb0ddb490d138d8a7645706289b165e4905cfb961cad0ceb27438292d931","category":"Cycling"}
