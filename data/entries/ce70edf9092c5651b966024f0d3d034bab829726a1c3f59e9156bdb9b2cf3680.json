Now, a team of archaeologists <a href=\"https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2021/05/20/viking-ship-burials-shrouded-in-mystery/\">has compared</a> its own detailed surveys with Worm's original illustrations and may have discovered two new ship settings that are consistent with that centuries-old survey, according to <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15564894.2021.1900955?journalCode=uica20\">a recent paper</a> published in the Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology.</p>\n<p>Vikings typically buried their dead, along with the deceased's material possessions, within a wooden ship. They then covered the grave with dirt to create a raised earthen mound. The Kalvestene, on a small island called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjarn%C3%B8\">Hjarnø</a>, is one of about 25 such sites in Denmark. Even though it's a relatively small grave field, the Kalvestene (literally translated as \"the calf stones\") was nonetheless well-known in the region. It is first mentioned in the 12th-century treatise <em>Gesta Danorum</em> (\"The History of the Danes\" or \"Deeds of the Danes\") by Danish theologian Saxo Grammaticus, and there are many other references throughout medieval and early modern texts.</p>\n<p>\"It's such an interesting site, and the fact that it is referred to in medieval sources—when other, larger monuments aren't—demonstrates it was a significant site, too,\" co-author Erin Sebo of Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, told Ars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772472#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772472&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce70edf9092c5651b966024f0d3d034bab829726a1c3f59e9156bdb9b2cf3680","category":"Tech"}
