I just don't understand, are we seven times less valuable than the men's race? I don't think so,' she said.</p>\n<p>At this weekend's races, €40,000 was split amongst the men while the women shared only €10,260, with the winners <a href=\"/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> and Chantal van den Broek-Blaak taking home €16,000 and €2,256 respectively.</p>\n<p>Banks also highlighted another race, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/56307206\" target=\"_blank\">revealed by the <em>BBC</em> to be Omloop Het Nieuwsblad</a>, saying: 'I got the race manual the night before and I always flick through to see what the difference in the prize money is, just out of interest, because some race organisers are really forward thinking and they're like, we're going to make the change now and we're going to make it equal and then everything else will come. </p>\n<p>'Not so much with this organiser, the prize fund for the male winner was €16,000 and the prize fund for the female winner was €930.'</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9367/former-team-sky-doctor-freeman-found-guilty-of-ordering-testosterone-for-athlete\">Former Team Sky doctor Freeman found guilty of ordering testosterone for athlete</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/912/milan-san-remo-route-riders-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Milan-San Remo 2021: Route, start list and all you need to know</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8694/beyond-the-tour-de-france-pyrenees-gravel-ride\">Beyond the Tour de France: Pyrenees gravel ride</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 111: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTomas van den Spiegel, chief executive of Omloop organiser Flanders Classics told the <em>BBC</em> that they had 'followed the UCI financial obligations' regarding the prize money and tweeted that the company aims to have equal pay at races by 2023.</p>\n<p><em>Watch an International Women's Day special feature on <a href=\"https://www.eurosport.co.uk/cycling/strade-bianche/2021/strade-bianche-2021-news-britains-lizzy-banks-calls-for-equal-prize-money-across-cycling_sto8159356/story.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Eurosport</a> and the Eurosport app: Monday 8th March at 19:00</em> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"fc2e80cc378125b371a14c1c9cee5f5687aaa89940b4998bcd964e783ee7293e","category":"Cycling"}
