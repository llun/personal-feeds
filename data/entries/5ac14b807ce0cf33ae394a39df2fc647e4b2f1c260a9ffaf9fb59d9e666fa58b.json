Gaming can be a part of that, yes,\nbut there needs to be more. Broader HomeKit support, perhaps with\nsupport for other wireless home standards, would help, as would a\nmuch more sophisticated set of home automations.</p>\n\n<p>And if Apple really wants to continue to play in the home-theater\nspace, I’ve been saying for years that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3341392/its-time-for-apple-to-get-back-into-the-smart-home-in-a-big-way.html\">there’s room for an Apple\nSoundBar</a>, that could integrate the big sound of HomePod with the\nApple TV software to create a solid music and video experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Snell is playing off a recent episode of <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">Dithering</a>, where Ben Thompson and I pondered the question of why Apple TV (hardware) exists in a world where the Apple TV app is built into TVs and present on other cheaper boxes, and where those new TVs also support AirPlay 2. My thought was gaming — double-down on it. Put a controller in the box. If you want to separate Apple TV from Roku and Amazon Fire and Chromecast, remember that there is no Roku/Fire/Chromecast Arcade. Only Apple Arcade.</p>\n\n<p>Really, Apple Arcade is the only recent evidence that Apple remains strongly committed to the Apple TV platform. Every single Apple Arcade game is available on Apple TV — which is difficult for games designed for touchscreen phones. And I will bet that it’s been difficult for some games performance-wise to achieve 30+ FPS on Apple TV 4K. I think Apple’s requirement that Arcade games not just play but play well on Apple TV is a sign that they’re committed.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s not going to win the war for AAA shooters against PlayStation or Xbox, but they could out-casual-game those two. Make Apple Arcade more of a competitor to Nintendo Switch, with an Apple TV plugged into your TV and mobile play on your iPhone or iPad.</p>\n\n<p>Making Apple TV a first-class HomeKit hub is a great idea too, and I’d buy an Apple sound bar in a heartbeat. (I’ve been using two HomePods for audio output from my Apple TV, and it works so great — but HomePods clearly aren’t optimized for this. A sound bar (SoundPod? HomeBar?) could be great.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Why Does the Apple TV Still Exist?’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/14/why-does-apple-tv-still-exist\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5ac14b807ce0cf33ae394a39df2fc647e4b2f1c260a9ffaf9fb59d9e666fa58b","category":"Tech"}
