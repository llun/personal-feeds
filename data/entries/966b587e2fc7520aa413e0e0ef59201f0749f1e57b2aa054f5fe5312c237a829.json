This story has been blown out of proportion but we wish to remind everyone of the safety rules on the race,” Prudhomme said, according to Reuters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you come to the Tour, you hold your kid, you hold your pet and don’t cross the road carelessly. And above all, you respect the riders – they’re the ones worthy of live TV.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ASO had originally filed a complaint after the massive pileup caused when Tony Martin (Jumbo-Visma) collided with the fan’s sign that was protruding into the road, creating a domino effect that brought down much of the peloton. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/sports/cycling/tour-de-france-crash-fan-arrest.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a>, the CPA also filed a complaint following the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spectator left the scene after the crash, but on Wednesday, she was reportedly <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/the-spectator-who-caused-a-crash-on-stage-1-of-the-tour-de-france-has-been-arrested/\" target=\"_blank\">arrested</a> and in police custody in Landerneau, and the New York Times reports that remains in custody on Thursday. Although the ASO has dropped its complaint, a French prosecutor is still deciding whether or not to press charges against her.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/aso-withdraws-complaint-against-fan-who-caused-crash-on-tour-stage-1/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"966b587e2fc7520aa413e0e0ef59201f0749f1e57b2aa054f5fe5312c237a829","category":"Cycling"}
