The hacker has released <a href=\"https://github.com/tostercx/GTAO_Booster_PoC\">a proof of concept DLL fix</a> that shortens those lengthy startup times by roughly 70 percent.</p>\n<p><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>'s PC load times have been a persistent issue for seven years now, remaining slow despite general improvements to hardware and the game's status as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/grand-theft-auto-online-averts-cancellation-by-printing-tons-of-money/\">a continuing lucrative revenue stream for publisher Take Two</a>.

The problem is even harder to understand when the single-player <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> tends to load many times faster.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746111#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746111&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9f8ad547218670f1e26aa699e5ffd9082d5f3951a95d7c713e1ba1e9f6f8ef6","category":"Tech"}
