The file, named “moserware.secretsplitter.dll,” contained a legitimate copy of an app called <a href=\"https://github.com/moserware/SecretSplitter\">SecretSplitter</a>, along with malicious code named \"Loader,\" according to a <a href=\"https://www.csis.dk/newsroom-blog-overview/2021/moserpass-supply-chain/\">brief writeup</a> from security firm CSIS Group.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/moserware-secretsplitter-loader.png\" /><p>(credit: CSIS Group)</p></div>\n<p>The Loader code attempts to retrieve the file archive at https://passwordstate-18ed2.kxcdn[.]com/upgrade_service_upgrade.zip so it can retrieve an encrypted second-stage payload. Once decrypted, the code is executed directly in memory. The email from Click Studios said that the code “extracts information about the computer system, and select Passwordstate data, which is then posted to the bad actors’ CDN Network.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759877#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759877&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"777aeb2c3e33d34517b9d4302a1c5034a3f2fefada6d69230967130953d6e5fd","category":"Tech"}
