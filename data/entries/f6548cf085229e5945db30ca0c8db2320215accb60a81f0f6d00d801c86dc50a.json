For Valentine's Day, the studio dropped a full two-minute-plus trailer for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder%27s_Justice_League\"><em>Zack Snyder's Justice League</em></a> to further reward the fandom's patience. Count me among the skeptics on the question of whether we really needed a \"Snyder cut,\" but I must admit, based on the full trailer, Snyder's version does seem markedly different from the theatrical release. Among other changes, the trailer includes a brief glimpse of Jared Leto's Joker, who didn't appear at all in the original.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/hbo-max-drops-first-trailer-for-zack-snyders-justice-league/\">we've reported previously</a>, the original <em>Justice League</em> was the third film in a trilogy that included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Steel_(film)\"><em>Man of Steel</em></a> (2013) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_v_Superman:_Dawn_of_Justice\"><em>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice</em></a> (2016). It brought together Ben Affleck's Batman and Henry Cavill's Superman with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). They are on a mission to save the world from arch-villain Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds), a \"New God\" in search of three \"Mother Boxes\" that will enable him to terraform the Earth into something more hospitable to him and his army of Parademons. </p>\n<p>Snyder completed all the principal photography and was well into post-production, but he stepped down as director in May 2017 following the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455\">tragic suicide</a> of his daughter, and the studio turned to Joss Whedon (<em>The Avengers</em>) to complete the film. Whedon rewrote the script, adding some 80 pages, and did extensive reshoots, bringing more humor and a brighter tone into the mix. He also cut more than 90 minutes of Snyder's original footage to accommodate the studio's requested 120-minute runtime, although Whedon's version retained the basic story outline. The result was what some critics called a \"Frankenstein\" film, struggling to incorporate the very different visions of two directors. Reviews were mixed, and while <em>Justice League</em> wound up grossing $657 million, the purported break-even point was around $750 million.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742236#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742236&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6548cf085229e5945db30ca0c8db2320215accb60a81f0f6d00d801c86dc50a","category":"Tech"}
