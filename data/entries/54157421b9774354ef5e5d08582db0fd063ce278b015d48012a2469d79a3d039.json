It is a cinch to install (and remove), it doesn’t rattle <i>and</i> it doesn’t look completely awful. It is also just over 220g apiece and is universal fit, mounting to a quick release or standard thru-axle on any 700c wheel bike, and has clearance for tyres up to 32mm.</p>\n<p>It is not perfect, and it does cost a pretty penny. But I’d hazard to say the Quickguard V2 mudguards will appeal to even the most enthusiastic mudguard objectors. Oh, and they are actually really easy to fit, and remove, and fit again.</p>\n<p>First thing’s first though, do not confuse the V2 with the original Quickguard, <a href=\"/reviews/7510/quickguard-mudguards-review\">as I reviewed</a> last year. It looks identical, the concept is the same, but where the originals failed, the V2s now succeed. Someone might just be listening.</p>\n<p>To save you <a href=\"/reviews/7510/quickguard-mudguards-review\">reading that whole review</a> (the only thing more boring than mudguards is reading about mudguards), the problem was the easy fit wasn’t so easy and the adjustability of angles of the blade in respect of the wheel wasn’t rangy enough. But that’s all been solved.</p>\n<div id=\"file-42688\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/quickguard_v2_mudguards_img_0158.jpg?itok=B04Wf38c\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The Quickguards comprise three parts: the mounting peg (alloy), which screws to the end of a thru-axle or quick release skewer; the one-sided struts (alloy), and the blade/guard (injection moulded plastic).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bicyclequickguard.co.uk/quickguard-mudguard/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Quickguard V2 mudguards now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The blade screws to the struts in two places using bevelled washers and slotted grooves, thus providing movement in order to line up the blade square with the tyre for maximum protection and style points.</p>\n<p>The struts then attach to the peg with a shoulder joint, a U-shaped piece of plastic that sleeves into the hollow struts and clamps around the peg like a handlebar stem clamps a steerer tube.</p>\n<div id=\"file-42689\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/quickguard_v2_mudguards_img_0152.jpg?itok=3opOfRjY\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It’s this joint that was previously the Achilles heel, and it’s this joint that has been redesigned. It’s now reinforced and, crucially, it permits enough rotational movement that I can now line up both Quickguards square over my old commuter’s wheels in a way that was impossible before.</p>\n<p>Yes, my commuter’s frame is cheap and less than perfectly true, but then so are a lot of bikes – much of the industry works to +/-2mm frame alignment tolerance on even high-end steeds.</p>\n<h3>Fitting</h3>\n<p>Fitting is very simple. Remove the QR nut from the skewer and replace with the peg. Tighten QR. Then slide on the strut and blade (which handily come screwed together already). From there, line the blade up over the wheel then tighten the three hex bolts – U-clamp and two on the blade. The only tool needed is a 5mm hex wrench.</p>\n<p>If the blade sits too high above your tyre, undo the bolts and remove some washes from the stack, then re-fix. Do that front and back and job done. It really is that simple. In theory.</p>\n<p>Of course these are mudguards, so the first install is still a bit finicky and I was undoing then redoing up bolts a few times to get things all set. But as guards go, this was by far the quickest set I’ve ever installed. No cutting rods, taping parts of frames so clamps don’t scratch or removing brake callipers.</p>\n<p>Then, best of all, once the things are dialled in if you want to remove the Quickguards you just undo your QR and put back on the original nut. Suddenly your bike is in dry-day mode.</p>\n<p>That’s a feature I can really get behind, because I would only ever want mudguards on when it’s raining, and while I did just leave these on my commuter (they are still there), if I had a second set I’d absolutely configure them for my race bike and have them on standby for rainy days, where I could pop them on in less than two minutes. Literally.</p>\n<div id=\"file-42690\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/quickguard_v2_mudguards_img_0163.jpg?itok=Xy0KPms2\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p><b></b>I reckon these are the lightest ‘proper’ mudguards on the market, 221g each (comparable SKS Raceblades, for example, are 365g each), and the Quickguard V2 is the second fastest mudguard to install after an Ass-Saver. I'd wager I could do yours in less than seven minutes. I have had practice though.</p>\n<p>I have been riding them in some really terrible weather, not paying much heed (except to clean them up for these photos) and they remain resolute and rattle free.</p>\n<p>I also took to installing them on the ‘wrong’ side, so the QR levers are on the drivetrain side. <em>Heathen!</em> You shout. But I tell you they are even less obtrusive like this, to the eye I mean – the drivetrain being a bike’s beautiful chocolate-box side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bicyclequickguard.co.uk/quickguard-mudguard/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Quickguard V2 mudguards now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>So in these things it’s all plus points. But still, the Quickguard V2 won’t be for everybody, mainly as the wheel coverage is not total.</p>\n<p>Many guards go under the brake calliper and down to the bottom bracket on the rear, and further over the wheel at the front, whereas the Quickguards are found wanting a tad at the rear at least, where they stop at the calliper. You don’t get that muddy or wet because of it, but without the BB extension plenty of detritus gets flung all over your frame and chainset.</p>\n<div id=\"file-42691\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/quickguard_v2_mudguards_img_0153.jpg?itok=GS0Bt28l\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The other slight issue is the one-sidedness. Lean the bike against something and catch the guard and you can come away with it askew, because there is no symmetry to the mounting hence no opposing strut to pull a bent guard back in line, as you get with a traditional setup. It's easily remedied, brute force for the braze, a quick nip and tuck for the more mechanically minded.</p>\n<p>However, the dealbreaker for many will be the price: £70 (£34.99 each) for a quick release bike, £110 (£54.99 each) for a bike with thru-axles. A set of the SKS guards mentioned costs £39.99 – that’s for both. That said, you can buy the Quickguard thru-axle adapter separately (£12.99 a wheel) so one set of guards could serve two bikes, one rim, one disc brake.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9215/chris-froome-isnt-sold-on-disc-brakes\">Chris Froome isn&#039;t sold on disc brakes</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9211/tom-pidcock-and-the-case-of-his-curious-5km-run\">Tom Pidcock and the case of his curious 5km run</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/7419/steve-cummings-has-retired-from-professional-cycling-heres-a-recap-of-his-best-win\">Steve Cummings has retired from professional cycling, here&#039;s a recap of his best win</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nYet here I’d argue the Quickguard V2s should last many years if properly looked after. For example, no careless back wheel-wheeling or shoddy bike stacking – and their maker, Chicken Cycle Kit, does provide a comprehensive list of replacement parts, and every part is individually replaceable. It also says the Quickguard V2 exceeds a test protocol for 50,000km riding. </p>\n<p>So, if you want a pair of mudguards that are rattle free and easy to fit (but don’t mind paying for the privilege) look no further.</p>\n<p>The Quickguard V2 deserves its name and, best of all for guard haters like me, a pair wouldn’t look ridiculously out of place on your Sunday best bike, so long as it was raining. Practical and almost, <i>almost</i> stylish. </p>\n  </div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"54157421b9774354ef5e5d08582db0fd063ce278b015d48012a2469d79a3d039","category":"Cycling"}
