While it's a fantastic display of the technology, most of the individual pieces of this feat have been done before—in some cases, over a decade before. But Neuralink has managed to take two important steps: miniaturizing the device and getting it to communicate wirelessly.</p>\n<h2>What has been done</h2>\n<p>Neuralink's goal is to develop easy-to-implant, compact, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/elon-musks-neuralink-both-an-evolution-and-a-plan-for-radical-change/\">wireless brain implants</a>. Initially, these will be used for the obvious goals, like re-establishing some degree of independence in paralyzed individuals. But Musk has made it very clear he sees the longer term goal as making the implants commonplace and able to do far more mundane things, like providing direct, brain-driven control of electronic devices.</p>\n<p>For now, however, the early goals are dominating progress. About a year and a half ago, Neuralink showed off hardware implanted in a number of pigs, with them providing real-term data about the goings-on within the pigs' sensory regions of the brain as they explored their surroundings. At the time, Musk suggested that the team was nearly ready for human testing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755945#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755945&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a9752c169b6008ae48acbac508eecabc0088424ce74c330378ade36d3509e46","category":"Tech"}
