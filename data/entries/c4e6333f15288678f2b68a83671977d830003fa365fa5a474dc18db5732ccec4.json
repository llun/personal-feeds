The problem, though, is that iPhone and iPad game controls often don&rsquo;t translate well to the Mac. Apple is making progress towards solving that problem in the latest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/331874/new-features-in-macos-big-sur-113-safari-customization-options-enhanced-support-for-iphoneipad-apps.html\">macOS Big Sur 11.3 beta</a> with support for game controller emulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First reported by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/macos-big-sur-11-3-controller-emulation-m1/&amp;xcust=1-1-340318-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">MacRumors</a>, the macOS beta has a setting in the app preferences to enable Controller Emulation, which lets you use a keyboard and mouse/touchpad combination to perform the same functions as a game controller. For example, the directional cross is mapped to the arrow keys on a keyboard, the left thumbstick is W-A-S-D, A is spacebar, and X and Y are mapped to Q and E.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can still use a game controller if you have one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"935\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-big-sur-touch-alternatives.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"macOS Big Sur 11.3 touch alternatives\" class=\"wp-image-100059394\" srcset=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-big-sur-touch-alternatives.jpg 1600w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-big-sur-touch-alternatives.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-big-sur-touch-alternatives.jpg?resize=768,449 768w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-big-sur-touch-alternatives.jpg?resize=1024,598 1024w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macos-big-sur-touch-alternatives.jpg?resize=1536,898 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"><figcaption><p>Touch Alternatives provides keyboard alternatives to touch controls you&rsquo;d typically use on iPad and iPhone apps.</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple currently has settings for Touch Alternatives, which are used in place of the touch controls you&rsquo;d typically use on iPad and iPhone apps but can&rsquo;t easily recreate on the Mac since they lack touchscreens. For example, the W-A-S-D keys perform a tilt, while the arrow keys perform swipes from the center of the app&rsquo;s screen. Touch Alternatives are a separate set of controls from Controller Emulation and are not used at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Apple Arcade FAQ: Complete list of games, price, compatibility, and everything you need to know","siteHash":"adebec2889d2c850b647694c05189202d7a61673f16abc2185b1ec8587b0b3dc","entryHash":"c4e6333f15288678f2b68a83671977d830003fa365fa5a474dc18db5732ccec4","category":"Apple"}
