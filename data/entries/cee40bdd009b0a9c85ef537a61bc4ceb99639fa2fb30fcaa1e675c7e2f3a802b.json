The rover, about the size of a car, can use its\nsophisticated cameras, lasers that can analyze the chemical makeup\nof Martian rocks and ground-penetrating radar to identify the\nchemical signatures of fossilized microbial life that may have\nthrived on Mars when it was a planet full of flowing water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Great landing, and a great day for science.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/mars2020/#/home\">More here, from NASA’S own website</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘NASA’s Perseverance Rover Lands on Mars’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/18/nasa-perseverance-mars\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cee40bdd009b0a9c85ef537a61bc4ceb99639fa2fb30fcaa1e675c7e2f3a802b","category":"Tech"}
