Choosing cellular over WiFi carries a $200 premium, which is more expensive than the $130 upgrade price that Apple normally charges for a cellular model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/ipad-pro-carrier-subsidies.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-20/apple-s-5g-ipad-upgrade-gets-rare-subsidy-from-wireless-carriers\">Bloomberg</a></em>, carriers are hoping to encourage customers to purchase the new 5G tablets despite the cellular price increase through subsidies. Multiple carriers are offering up to $200 in gift cards, which makes choosing a 5G ‌iPad Pro‌ over a standard WiFi version more or less free, with the exception of monthly costs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nVerizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint are all offering $200 reimbursements, while AT&amp;T is offering $150 back. AT&amp;T is providing credits to a monthly bill, while Verizon is offering a digital gift card. T-Mobile and Sprint are providing a gift card that can be spent like a credit card.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCarriers often offer these kinds of discounts for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models, but it is unusual to see these subsidies provided for iPads.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/ipad-pro-5g-carrier-subsidies/\">Carriers Offering Discounts Up to $200 to Subsidize Higher Cost of 5G iPad Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/carriers-offering-discounts-up-to-200-to-subsidize-higher-cost-of-5g-ipad-pro-models.2292447/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3EaGXZu8lFs:iuweGwXJYnw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3EaGXZu8lFs:iuweGwXJYnw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3EaGXZu8lFs\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1545637e9a29cb68752610c0294438903108df346a8b2e1e96e10704224f0d82","category":"Apple"}
