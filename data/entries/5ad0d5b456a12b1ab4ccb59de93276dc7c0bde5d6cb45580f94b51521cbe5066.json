On Wednesday, the company signed an agreement with Proterra, a leading US commercial EV manufacturer. The deal was the last piece of the puzzle that, now complete, will see Volta's 16-tonne (35,000lb) Volta Zero truck move forward. In 2020, Volta Trucks signed a deal with a Michigan-based company called Meritor, which will supply the Zero's electric motors.</p>\n<p>\"I'm delighted to welcome Proterra—a world-class innovative engineering partner—to the supply chain for the Volta Zero. When talking to our extensive group of customers, vehicle range is uppermost in their minds as it sits at the heart of the vehicle's ability to deliver for them. It was therefore imperative that we work with an industry-leader to ensure the quality, longevity, and safe performance of the battery. Proterra's cutting-edge but well-proven battery technology perfectly delivers all of this for us and our customers,\" said Rob Fowler, CEO of Volta Trucks.</p>\n<p>The Zero is designed for city deliveries, and Proterra's battery pack should give the vehicle a range of 124 miles (200km), which is more than sufficient for a day's work in stop-start, low-speed traffic.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743045#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743045&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
