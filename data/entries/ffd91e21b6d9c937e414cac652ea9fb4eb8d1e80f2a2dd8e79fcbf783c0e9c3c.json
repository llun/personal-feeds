The company is also exploring a range of subscription features for its electric vehicles, including “range or performance” increases that can be purchased on an hourly or daily basis, said Thomas Ulbrich, a Volkswagen board member, to the German newspaper <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article231681663/7-Euro-pro-Stunde-fuer-Autonomes-Fahren-so-will-VW-bald-Geld-verdienen.html\">Die Welt</a>. Ulbrich said the first subscription features will appear in the second quarter of 2022 in vehicles based on Volkswagen’s MEB platform, which underpins the company's new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/this-is-volkswagens-new-e30000-electric-car-the-id-3/\">ID.3 compact car</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/two-days-with-a-volkswagen-id-4-heres-what-we-learned/\">ID.4 crossover</a>.</p>\n<p>The executive said that Volkswagen will also offer video games in cars, similar to Tesla’s arcade. “In the charging breaks, even if they only last 15 minutes, we want to offer customers something,” Ulbrich said. He said the automaker wouldn’t be developing the games themselves, and it’s not clear whether they’ll come preinstalled or be available for purchase through an app store.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771839#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771839&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ffd91e21b6d9c937e414cac652ea9fb4eb8d1e80f2a2dd8e79fcbf783c0e9c3c","category":"Tech"}
