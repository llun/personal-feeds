[credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.universalpictures.com/\">Universal Pictures</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>A few months ago, ahead of this week's launch of <em>Fast 9</em>, I began pulling myself out of the wreckage that was the COVID-19 pandemic by going to... let's all say it with Vin Diesel's emphasis... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eblKqTZ-0Q\">the moo-vies</a>. I cite Diesel because my 2021 moviegoing spree began with <a href=\"https://www.fastfridayscreenings.com/\">Fast Fridays</a>, a free, once-a-week opportunity to relive his massive <em>The Fast &amp; The Furious</em> oeuvre on the big screen.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I'd never felt the need to become Fast in theaters or catch up with a growing pile of Furiosity on VOD and streaming services. But the idea of riding with the entire series in theaters, once a week, as a newly vaccinated member of society, itching for something to safely do outside my home? Especially as a fun alternative to the somber, straight-to-streaming likes of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/justice-leagues-snyder-cut-review-no-longer-whedonesque-and-all-the-better/\">the Snyder Cut</a>? Sure, brah.</p>\n<p>This differed from my colleague Peter Opaskar's 2019 experiment, which saw him <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/what-i-learned-about-cars-watching-all-8-fast-furious-movies-in-4-days/\">shotgun the full series on his couch over the course of two days</a>. I arguably had a much better time, as my once-a-week pacing helped me savor the films' shameless constructions. I've never seen a film series do a better job stringing together such artfully crafted stupidity over so many hours, all aided by scripts full of big heart and action sequences full of sensational practical effects.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775692#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775692&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab349691f3b259f1abd89cbc59dc9da747538d20ca998195c756f5ce64fa1530","category":"Tech"}
