None of the numbers correspond to Apple's existing smartphone lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe EEC filing, published on Friday, satisfies Russia's requirement for companies to register all products containing encryption and/or cryptographic tools. Several new models of ‌iPhone‌ and Mac have been registered with the EEC in previous years and these devices turned out to correspond with later device launches.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's 2021 ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup, due to launch in September, will look similar to the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, with four devices in sizes that include 5.4-inches, 6.1-inches, and 6.7-inches, with two of the iPhones being higher-end \"Pro\" models and two positioned as lower-cost, more affordable devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMajor design changes are not expected, and 2021 iPhones will have the same feature set as the 2020 iPhones, but we can count on camera improvements, a faster A-series processor, a new 5G chip from Qualcomm, increased battery life, and some tweaks to the notch.
