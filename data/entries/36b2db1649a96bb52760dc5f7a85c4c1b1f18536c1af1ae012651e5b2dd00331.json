this past week to meet with a brand we love<span id=\"more-36083\"></span> and know very well – Enve Composites.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>These guys make some of the best products in the world and we’re always proud to feature them on our premium builds of virtually all our models at Moots.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>With a product set ranging from wheels, to stems, handlebars and posts, you can never go wrong spec’ing their gear on your favorite ride.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36091 size-full\"

have an actual business trip and I think the crew at Enve were equally excited to see us, rolling out the red carpet for a first class tour of their amazing facility.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>From the moment you walk in the door, you will be impressed with everything in their factory.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The team at Enve spared no expense when it came to investing in state of the art technology and we left quite impressed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>When you build the best wheels in the world, you know better than anyone the tools you’ll need and they’ve invested in the machinery needed to make all their own molds and tooling, allowing them to innovate at a pace that is unmatched, really shortening the time it takes for products to move from innovation to production. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36094

into the layout of the facility as well, where raw materials are pulled from the freezer, cut to specifications, placed in a “pack” with all the pieces needed for the wheel being built, all in an efficient way guided by software that minimizes waste.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>From there it moves to the skilled team who performs the “layup” of the mold prior to heating.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It was fun learning about the time it takes to do this job perfectly to ensure the product meets specifications.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We know all about that here at Moots as it easily takes 2 years of investment in time and training in some roles before a new employee is finally up to our production standards. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36097 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/ENVE_IM_170228_20464.jpg\" alt=\"\"

/></p>\n<p>Once the layup is complete, the wheels move on to some large industrial ovens for the final piece of manufacturing, baking to the perfect level of hardness in less than an hour.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>After some finish work by both machine and hand along with a QC check, these wheels are ready to ship to customers all over the world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Given the demand for their products in 2020, the team was incredibly busy and has been running at full capacity for some time, a high class problem for sure.

see another first class manufacturing facility, but what we were really excited about is what their R&amp;D team has cooking and how we might use it here at Moots.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We got a sneak peak of some things we can’t even hint about, but also got to see one of their new products just released this week, their <strong>NEW</strong> <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/en/products/ses-ar-road-handlebar/\">SES AR HANDLEBAR</a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We are super excited about that new bar and see it as a perfect fit for all of our gravel bikes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>With great hand positioning options, a tight yet comfortable profile and cable routing options we just love, we believe this will be the perfect bar to pair with your new Moots Routt family bike. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36099 size-full\"

business trip is any good unless it involves a ride, so after a few hours together, we took off to Snowbasin to ride one of their local favorites.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Although we were short on daylight, we got in an awesome ride on a beautiful fall day with colors that were just outstanding.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We won’t soon forget bombing down the hill through a tunnel of beautiful red and golden leaves that felt like you should have been in a video promotional shoot.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It was a fantastic time for sure and a reminder as to why it is important to build relationships.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We are proud of the one we’ve built with Enve and expect it to only get stronger in the future.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36095 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/ENVE_190715_IM28359.jpg\" alt=\"\"
