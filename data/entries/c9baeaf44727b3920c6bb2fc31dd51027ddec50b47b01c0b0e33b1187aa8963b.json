{"title":"Peloton’s $120 Credit & 10X Points for Chase Sapphire Cardholders (US only)","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/03/pelotons-120-credit-10x-points-for-chase-sapphire-cardholders-us-only.html","date":1617211800000,"content":"<h3><img src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2020/09/Peloton-BikePlus-Unboxing.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></h3>\n<p>This one is entirely for US folks, as it has to do with credit cards. But, it’s a pretty notable ‘deal’ when you start doing the math on it – and could be an interesting template for other larger companies to look at (cough, Zwift). If you remember the way-back machine, last October Peloton announced a partnership with Chase Sapphire/Reserve for <strong>cardholders to get back $120 of their annual Peloton subscription fees</strong>, as a credit on their credit card statement (so basically, a refund). However, now it’s expanded to getting <strong>10x points for purchase of Peloton hardware (Bike/Bike+/Tread/Tread+/accessories)</strong>. So the purchase of a new <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/02/peloton-bike-plus-in-depth-review.html\">Peloton Bike+</a> gets you basically 25,000 points – or enough for a free round-trip US flight in most cases (depending on the myriad of ways you can redeem points).</p>\n<p>Essentially, there are two variants of bonus/credits that Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders get:</p>\n<p><strong><u>Sapphire Preferred folks:</u></strong></p>\n<p>&#8211; <strong>Subscriptions credit:</strong> Sapphire Preferred folks get a $60 credit per year for Peloton subscription fees<br />\n&#8211; <strong>10X points on Bikes/Tread/accessories:</strong> This is capped at 25,000 points for Sapphire Preferred cardholders, so basically any purchases above the $2,500 threshold just earn the regular points amounts, not the 10X multiplier. So if you bought a Tread+ for example (which is $4,200), you’re only earning the multiplier on the first chunk of it.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Sapphire Reserve folks:</u></strong></p>\n<p>&#8211; <strong>Subscriptions credit:</strong> Sapphire Reserve folks get a $120 credit per year for Peloton subscription fees<br />\n&#8211; <strong>10X points on Bikes/Tread/accessories:</strong> This is capped at 50,000 points for Sapphire Reserve cardholders, so basically any purchases above the $5,000 threshold just earn the regular points amounts, not the 10X multiplier.</p>\n<p>Technically speaking, the minimum purchase for the 10X multiplier is $1,800 – but since Peloton doesn’t sell any bikes or treadmills below $1,800, then that’s largely a moot point (unless you plan to buy accessories decoupled from your bike/treadmill purchase).</p>\n<p>If you have a Chase Sapphire or Reserve card, <a href=\"https://www.onepeloton.com/digital/promotions/chase\">you simply need to associate your Chase account to your Peloton account</a> to start getting the Peloton credits/refunds, as well as to then earn the bonus before purchasing a Peloton thingy. It literally takes like 7 seconds. You should then see on your dashboard some time later the statement credit show up.

Like…real deep into the nuances of frequent flyer points. So, the potential usage of 25,000+ Chase points is far greater than just a simple free flight, due to the way you can redeem Chase points as cash or transfer straight into various airline/hotel programs. Heck, you can even straight buy an Apple Watch using the points. 25,000 points equals $250 of Apple credit money on their site – almost enough for an Apple Watch SE. In fact, doing a search for 10 days from now, it’s just shy of the 28,895 points needed for a round-trip flight needed from Washington DC to Amsterdam. Mostly because the plane is empty, and because most Americans aren’t allowed in Europe right now. But hey…that’s besides the point.)</em></p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"c9baeaf44727b3920c6bb2fc31dd51027ddec50b47b01c0b0e33b1187aa8963b","category":"Cycling"}
