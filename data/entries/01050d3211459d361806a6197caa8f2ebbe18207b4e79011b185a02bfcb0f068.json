{"title":"Prosser: iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack to Feature Reverse Charging","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/prosser-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-reverse-charging/","date":1614633538000,"content":"Apple is working on MagSafe-compatible battery packs that will be compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models, and leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> today said on the <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+o4hHnFsTA/19:40\">Genius Bar podcast</a> that one version of the battery pack will feature \"reverse charging.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magsafe-charging-brick-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784575\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Prosser, Apple is working on two versions of the battery packs, one that's a standard version and one that's a premium version with reverse charging. Prosser does not go into detail on reverse charging, but presumably this means that the battery pack will be able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; while also charging <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> from the other side at the same time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nReverse charging could also mean that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> would be able to charge the battery pack, but that doesn't make much sense, so the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; scenario is more likely.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nProsser has a mixed track record when it comes to predicting Apple's plans and is not always accurate, so the reliability of this information is unclear and should be viewed with some skepticism until confirmed. Prosser claims that his source is \"not sure\" if Apple will release both of these battery packs or if only one will launch, so we may not see a version with reverse charging debut. Later this week, Prosser plans to release renders of the battery packs based on information from his source.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's work on &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; battery packs became apparent in mid-February after the launch of the second iOS 14.5 beta. There was a mention of a mysterious \"battery pack\" discovered in the code by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser, and <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-working-on-magsafe-battery-iphone-12/\">later confirmed </a> that Apple is indeed working on an &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> battery pack.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGurman did not mention a reverse charging possibility, but some of the prototypes were described as having a white rubber exterior. Gurman said that development on the accessory has been hindered by software issues that Apple is still working on fixing before releasing the accessory.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBilateral wireless charging <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/01/two-way-wireless-charging-2019-iphones/\">was rumored for the 2019</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> models, but it did not end up being a feature that Apple implemented because the company wasn't able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/09/kuo-2019-iphone-expectations/\">make it work</a>. Two way wireless charging would have allowed an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to charge another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or to charge a small accessory like the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-accessories/\">MagSafe Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/prosser-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-reverse-charging/\">Prosser: iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack to Feature Reverse Charging</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prosser-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-to-feature-reverse-charging.2286692/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BP3ONzoWP6k:z3JedjRBiao:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BP3ONzoWP6k:z3JedjRBiao:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BP3ONzoWP6k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01050d3211459d361806a6197caa8f2ebbe18207b4e79011b185a02bfcb0f068","category":"Apple"}
