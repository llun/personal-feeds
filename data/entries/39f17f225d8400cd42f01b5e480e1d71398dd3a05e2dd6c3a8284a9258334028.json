In what appear to be the most severe cases, &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs are <a href=\"https://linustechtips.com/topic/1306757-m1-mac-owners-are-experiencing-extremely-high-ssd-writes-over-short-periods-of-time-likely-thanks-to-aggressive-swap/\">said to be</a> consuming as much as 10 to 13 percent of the maximum warrantable total bytes written (TBW) value of its SSD.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFlash memory on solid-state drives, such as those used in Macs, can only be written to a certain number of times before they become unstable. Software ensures that load is spread evenly across the drive's memory cells, but there is a point when the drive has been written to so many times that it can no longer reliably hold data. So while SSD wear is normal, expected behavior, drives should not be exhausting their ability to hold data as quickly as some &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs seem to be.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOne user showed that their &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac had already consumed one percent of its SSD after just two months, while another &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac with a 2TB SSD had already consumed three percent. The total data units written for these machines is running into many terabytes, when they would normally be expected to be considerably lower.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"cs\" dir=\"ltr\">16GB &zwnj;M1&zwnj; MBP, 2TB SSD, 2 months in. <a href=\"https://t.co/SaSmieaT1s\">pic.twitter.com/SaSmieaT1s</a></p>&mdash; David (@david_rysk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_rysk/status/1361155414994407424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe user with three percent usage <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1361722552238841860?s=21\">speculated</a> that, were his machine a 256GB model, it could have used as much as 30 percent to date, and have reached maximum TBW in around two years. An SSD can continue to function once its TBW limit has been reached, but there is no knowing how long it will last past this point.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is not known how widespread the TBW issue is, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1364206594117038087?s=21\">reports</a> of strange SSD behavior are also now emerging from users with Intel-based Macs, suggesting that the TBW issue may not be exclusive to &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe reported wear is so extreme on some &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs that it suggests the problem is due to a bug rather than the expected behavior of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, but it is unclear if the problem pertains to erroneous readings or macOS genuinely writing vast amounts of data to the drive.
