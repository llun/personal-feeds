You’ll remember last fall Polar refreshed the higher-end Vantage V, with the Vantage V2. At this point, Polar has essentially refreshed the bulk of their wearables lineup in the last 12 months – inclusive of launching the trail-focused Grit X last spring, which kinda slides in between the Vantage M2 and V2.</p>\n<p>For this review though, I’m gonna focus entirely on the M2. And most of the features that we see it gain are largely ones Polar has previously launched on the Vantage V2 or Grit X last year. In fact, there’s only a single ‘unseen’ feature with this launch, the ability to broadcast your Vantage M2 heart rate to apps like Zwift or TrainerRoad using Bluetooth Smart. While Polar has toyed with HR broadcasting in various devices over the years, it was mostly limited to talking to other Polar devices, and even then, it rarely worked properly. This time though, they’ve revamped the tech to follow Bluetooth Smart HR broadcasting standards. Now, that&#8217;s only enabled today in the Ignite 2 &#8211; but it&#8217;s it&#8217;ll hit the Vantage M2, Vantage V2, &amp; Grit X later this year.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the Vantage M2 is aimed at folks who want a full-featured multisport watch – but don’t want to pay Garmin prices for it. And frankly, it does a really good job of that. It’s got connectivity to all the sensor types most need (like cycling power meters), while recording your workouts across a slew of sport profiles – all for under $300. Here’s the quick and dirty in a roughly 8-minute long video, highlighting all the key bits:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-j8qCXc7yMo\" width=\"720\" height=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>For this review I’ve been using a media loaner Polar Vantage M2 (as well as an Ignite 2) – and putting it through its paces. Once I’m done with the unit I’ll toss it in a box and get it shipped back to Polar. That&#8217;s just the way I roll.

And of course, it makes you awesome.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What’s new:</span></h3>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3861.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3861\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3861_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3861\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>In many ways, the Vantage M2 will feel pretty familiar to Polar fans, largely because virtually every feature but one has already been rolled out to recent Polar devices like the Vantage V2 and Grit X over the past year. And inversely, the singular new feature not yet on the Vantage V2 will get an update “later in 2021”, and with that, the Grit X will get the newer features too.</p>\n<p>Still, here’s what’s new to the Polar Vantage M2, in comparison to the original Vantage M:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Added Music controls widget/dashboard<br />\n&#8211; Added weather forecast widget/dashboard<br />\n&#8211; Added weekly training summary widget/dashboard<br />\n&#8211; Added FuelWise – hydration &amp; nutrition reminders based on past workouts<br />\n&#8211; Added Nutrition energy sources – breakdown of carbs/protein/fats<br />\n&#8211; Added watch face customization – choose which widgets/dashboards to see<br />\n&#8211; Added power save modes – increases non-GPS continuous workout time to 100 hours<br />\n&#8211; Adds new HR broadcasting over Bluetooth feature “later this year”<br />\n&#8211; New watch colors<br />\n&#8211; New band design<br />\n&#8211; New bezel design with etching<br />\n&#8211; Pricing increases slightly from $279/279EUR to $299/299EUR</p>\n<p>Somewhat oddly, the Ignite 2 got new heart rate broadcasting features today, but the Vantage M2 doesn&#8217;t have it at launch. Instead, down the road, the Vantage M2/V2/Grit X will get an update for that. Additionally, the Grit X will get the Weekly Training Summary dashboard view, the music controls, and the weather forecast bits in a firmware update. There&#8217;s no specific timeline for that other than &#8216;later this year&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Also, in case you didn’t see all the updates that the original Vantage M got, remember it received these major features updates before its last feature firmware update about a year ago:</p>\n<p>&#8211; FitSpark: Essentially suggested workouts on a daily basis<br />\n&#8211; Race Pace: A virtual pacer option for running to hit a target time<br />\n&#8211; Sleep Plus Stages: Sleep details including sleep cycles and states<br />\n&#8211; Nightly Recharge: This uses ANSI data to determine how much you recovery each night<br />\n&#8211; Serene Breathing Exercises: Pretty much as titled<br />\n&#8211; ZoneLock: This allows you to focus on a specific HR zone during a workout<br />\n&#8211; Galileo &amp; QZSS Satellite support: This is atop the existing GPS &amp; GPS+GLONASS options<br />\n&#8211; Fitness Tests: Determines your Vo2Max using a short test</p>\n<p>Again, all of those in this last section were added to the Polar Vantage M (original version) during the timeframe after release. There are more minor updates and bug fixes and such, but those are the big-ticket ones.</p>\n<p>When it comes to comparing it to the Vantage V2, the main things the Vantage V2 has that the M2 lacks are:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Barometric altimeter<br />\n&#8211; Hill splitter (which depends on barometric altimeter)<br />\n&#8211; Recovery Pro<br />\n&#8211; Running Performance Test<br />\n&#8211; Cycling FTP Test<br />\n&#8211; Leg Recovery Test<br />\n&#8211; Route navigation (including with Komoot routes)<br />\n&#8211; Strava Live Segments<br />\n&#8211; Built-in running power support (depends on barometric altimeter)<br />\n&#8211; Longer battery life<br />\n&#8211; Higher waterproof spec (100m on V2 vs 30m on M2)<br />\n&#8211; V2 has a touchscreen</p>\n<p>Ok, got all that? Good, let’s get it unboxed.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What’s in the box:</span></h3>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3747.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3747\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3747_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3747\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Cracking open the top of the Vantage M2 box, you’ll find the watch sitting atop an upper level, concealing the chargers and extra band below it:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3749.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3749\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3749_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3749\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Inside each Vantage M2 box is a standard Polar Vantage charging cable (same as Vantage M/V/V2/Grit X), as well as an extra longer strap. In my case, the default strap was more than long enough for my apparently skinnier runner wrists.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3753.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3753\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3753_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3753\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here’s a closer look at the charging cable:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3759.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3759\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3759_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3759\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>And then we’ve got the quick start guide that was chilling inside that box:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3863.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3863\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3863_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3863\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here’s a closer look at the Vantage M2, which features a new etched bezel design.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3864.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3864\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3864_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3864\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>In my case I’ve got the white/gold one, though I personally like the look of the darker colors/etching better. Here are all the options:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/PolarM2.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"PolarM2\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/PolarM2_thumb.png\" alt=\"PolarM2\" width=\"722\" height=\"261\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can see the new strap design is definitely far better than previous iterations, and is fairly comfortable too – I like it!</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3865.jpg\"><img style=\"display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3865\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3865_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3865\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Plus, it lies flat, unlike the original one, which forced the strap around the corners.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3866.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3866\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3866_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3866\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The weight of the unit comes in at 44g, exactly the same as before:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3867.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0px; border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3867\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3867_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3867\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ok, with that let’s start using it.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Basics:</span></h3>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3869.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3869\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3869_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3869\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>For most people that get a smartwatch, the purpose is a blend of sports-focused usage with everyday wearability and health tracking. And the Vantage M2 is no different in that respect and its functionality. Sure, it doesn’t have the pretty display of an Apple Watch – but it doesn’t try and be one either. An Apple Watch has a battery that lasts a day, or two if you’re lucky. Whereas a sport-specific watch like the Vantage M2 is gonna last a week or two in normal smartwatch mode. Different things for different people.</p>\n<p>For this first section, I’m going to dive into all those day to day usage type aspects, and then we’ll hit sports in the next section. While most of this will be old-hat to those familiar with recent Polar releases, there are some new tidbits in here worth nothing – notably around some of the dashboard views.</p>\n<p>To begin, the Vantage M2 is a non-touchscreen watch (whereas the Vantage V2 is touchscreen), instead you’ll use one of the five buttons on the side. And honestly, that’s perfectly fine by me. The last thing I want to deal with is a finicky touchscreen trying to get a lap marker on a track workout (hence, why the V2 still has buttons, in case you were wondering).</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3870.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3870\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3870_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3870\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now by most modern standards, the Vantage M2’s menu and user interface is a bit slow. I’m not expecting lightning quick here, but I do feel like Polar probably needs to consider some meaningful performance upgrades at some point for the next hardware version. I’d consider this acceptable for the most part, but you can definitely feel the lag. Note that each time you press a bit you get a nice vibration, which is well executed.</p>\n<p>The strap on the Vantage M2 is removable, and you can swap it out for any 22mm strap you have. I still continue to find it bizarre that Polar’s higher-end Vantage V2 is a propriety strap design (though at least swappable), while the less expensive M2 is fully industry standard. I’m not complaining in the case of the M2, but just a thought.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3871.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3871\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3871_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3871\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>On the backside of the Vantage M2 you’ll see the optical HR sensor. This is used to measure your heart rate 24&#215;7, as well as breathing rate and other sleep metrics. During a workout it goes into a higher power mode for more accurate HR measurement there. Notably however, it does not appear to be the same exact sensor set as the Vantage V2 or Grit X. Both of those used a 10 LED arrangement (5 red, 4 orange/yellow, 1 green), whereas both the Vantage M2 and Ignite M2 appear to have gone back to a slightly different arrangement of 9 LED’s (5 green, 4 red, + 1 unused yellow) – previously used on the Vantage M &amp; Vantage V.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3876.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3876\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3876_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3876\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>I’ve gotta wonder if this is Polar quietly admitting the Vantage V2/Grit X sensor was actually a step back in accuracy. Myself and many other reviewers found it finicky, often showing small spikes in the HR – and in general being less accurate than the generally quite good original Vantage series sensors. In any case, more on accuracy later.</p>\n<p>The Vantage M2 adds the newer tweakable dashboard pages found on the V2. These pages are often called widgets by other companies, but basically allow you to get consolidated information in other areas such as sleep, steps, or workout history. And Polar has introduced a few new pages here, as well as the aforementioned ability to select which pages you actually want displayed. Starting in no particular order, here’s the heart rate one. This will show the time/date (and battery too when you raise your wrist) in the main dashboard, as well as your current heart rate. You can then tap it to get more details about your heart rate for the day:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019542.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019542\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019542_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019542\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Polar Vantage M2 constantly records your heart rate to the watch, and then syncs it onwards to Polar Flow via the smartphone app (or desktop app if plugged in). From there you can see it on Polar Flow mobile app, or the website. For example, here’s a look at a day’s worth of heart rate data, including two workouts:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image001-3.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"clip_image001\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image001_thumb-3.png\" alt=\"clip_image001\" width=\"357\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>After that, you’ve got sleep tracking. This is essentially subdivided into two pieces: Sleep Plus Stages and Nightly Recharge. The first piece covers things like when you went to sleep and your sleep phases. While the Nightly Recharge bits looks at how well you’ve recovered each night. Nightly recharge takes three days&#8217; worth of data before it starts showing details, and will improve over time the longer you wear it.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019550.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019550\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019550_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019550\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can tap into that page to see more details on both sections:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019552.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019552\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019552_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019552\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019555.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019555\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019555_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019555\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Alternatively, all of this is also found up on Polar Flow too:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image0016-3.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"clip_image001[6]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image0016_thumb-3.png\" alt=\"clip_image001[6]\" width=\"357\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image0018-2.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"clip_image001[8]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image0018_thumb-2.png\" alt=\"clip_image001[8]\" width=\"357\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>For the most part, I find Polar’s sleep tracking pretty good. I didn’t have any meaningful errors here, with the sleep times within a few mins of when I actually fell asleep or woke up. And recharge bits were relatively close most days to how I felt – though, I have no way of knowing whether or not the sleep phase/stage data is correct.</p>\n<p>After that, we’ve got FitSpark. This was introduced back on the original Vantage M watch in a later firmware update, and it essentially gives you daily suggested workouts to maintain your current fitness level. There are different types of workouts such as strength, cardio, and supportive (typically flexibility-focused). And it’s smart enough to generally first offer a cardio or strength workout, and then after you’ve done that, it’ll give you a supportive workout. But more on this later in the Sports section. In this case, I’ve already done a few Cardio workouts for today, so it’s giving me some stretching to do:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3878.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3878\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3878_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3878\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>And then later on, it tells me I’ve done enough this day:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019562.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019562\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019562_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019562\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>After that, we’ve got the weather page, and somehow, it’s not raining here in Amsterdam. Don’t worry, just give it a few hours.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019563.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019563\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019563_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019563\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can tap into that, and it’ll ever-so-slowly load expected rain, wind speed, and the forecast for the coming days. It’s some of these detail-heavy pages that you really see the user interface kinda drag a bit.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019565.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019565\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019565_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019565\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next, there’s my weekly training summary, in hours and time per heart rate zone. There’s been a lot of workouts lately.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019529.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019529\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019529_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019529\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can tap this to then get more details on the zones, distances, calories, and activities, allowing you to see each activity that contributed to that weekly total.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019531.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019531\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019531_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019531\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Going back to the main dashboard page we’ve got the daily steps. In my case, this is helped by a long meander that afternoon:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019535.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019535\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019535_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019535\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>And then there’s the training status page. As is often the case when 3-5 products get released on a single day, my Polar (and Garmin) training status will helpfully remind me that my workout load is a poor idea. I helpfully remind them who pays the bills around here. It still taunts me.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019537.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019537\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019537_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019537\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can dive into that to see the exact breakdown and why it’s upset at you.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019538.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019538\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019538_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019538\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019539.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019539\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019539_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019539\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now, whether any of these dashboards are displayed can be customized via the Watch Face Views option. You’ll find that by pressing the lower left button and scroll down a bit. You can then toggle which widgets/dashboards you want to see, and which ones you don’t. I mean, I don’t want to name names here, but the dashboard that keeps showing me as ‘Overreaching’ is pretty close to getting the ax.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3879.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3879\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3879_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3879\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3880.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3880\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3880_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3880\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Off in that semi-settings area you’ll also find the Serene guided breathing exercises. To execute these you’ll sit on a couch and look at bubbles on the watch:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3881.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3881\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3881_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3881\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can configure the overall duration as well as the inhale/exhale lengths, and it’ll walk you through each step until completion.</p>\n<p>Next, there’s smartphone notifications. These non-interactive alerts will be sent from your iOS/Android phone whenever apps that you’ve configured on your phone send a notification. They could be Strava, Twitter, Facebook, Tinder….anything. You can’t reply to them though, so it’s just one-way in nature.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3883.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3883\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3883_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3883\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>New to the Vantage M2 is the music control dashboard. You can either toggle this on as a dashboard, or access it via the menu. This allows you to control music on your phone. You’ll access this by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. You’ll need to have a music app open on your phone for this to work. The Vantage M2 does *NOT* have any music storage on it. So it’s *ONLY* controlling music already on your phone.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3886.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3886\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3886_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3886\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Somewhat neat though is that it does pull the correct icon for the app it’s controlling, so you can see the Spotify icon shown there – a nice touch. I can skip/rewind/pause/play on the main screen, as well as tap the volume icon to increase volume:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3887.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3887\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3887_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3887\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are no other options beyond that, such as selecting songs or such. It’s just iterating through what you have – pretty similar to what buttons on a pair of headphones would do.</p>\n<p>Oh, and last but not least, you can slightly change the watch face between digital and analog, as well as change the accent colors and whether or not to display seconds. But ultimately, there are very few watch face options here compared to most other watches on the market. This is another area that Polar could probably aim to spend a bit of time, if not for the Vantage series,  but likely more so for the Ignite/Unite series.</p>\n<p>With all the basics covered, let’s dive into the reason you actually bought this watch: The sports functionality.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sport Features &amp; Usage:</span></h3>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019590.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"P1019590\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/P1019590_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"P1019590\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Vantage M2 follows the Grit X in many ways, and in fact, one could basically consider the Vantage M2 a Grit X without a baro altimeter or course tracking. Both watches get almost identical new features over the existing Vantage M. And if we look at the total new features on the M2, roughly half of them are sports features (versus the other half being day to day type features). Here’s the sports-focused set:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Added weekly training summary widget/dashboard<br />\n&#8211; Added FuelWise – hydration &amp; nutrition reminders based on past workouts<br />\n&#8211; Added Nutrition energy sources – breakdown of carbs/protein/fats<br />\n&#8211; Added power save modes – increases non-GPS continuous workout time to 100 hours</p>\n<p>First up though, let’s dive into sport modes. To start a workout you’ll either long-hold the middle right button, or tap the bottom left button and select ‘Start Training’. Both options take you here though, which is where you choose the sport mode you want:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3894.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3894\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3894_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3894\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Polar Vantage M2 can store locally some 20 sport profiles, with each profile having customized data fields, calorie burn metrics, and a slew of other settings. These sport profiles are controlled on Polar Flow, either via the smartphone app or website. There are gazillions of sport profiles to choose from. While many of them are similar, the main thing is really calorie burn metrics between them.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image-91.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image_thumb-91.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"357\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once a sport profile is selected, you can change the data fields and pages you want shown, or the frequency of update rates. You can also change zone limits, as well as automatic laps, and more. These can be changed on both Polar Flow online, or via your smartphone app:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image-92.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image_thumb-92.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"533\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>For example, it’s in here that you can tweak the data fields shown on your watch:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image-93.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image_thumb-93.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"430\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>These changes are synced to your watch anytime you sync your watch, which can be done via Bluetooth Smart to your phone, or cable to your computer. Usually the sync process takes about 20-40 seconds via computer, or about 30-60 seconds via Bluetooth Smart. It does tend to take longer though if you haven’t synced in a while and it needs to sync GPS cache information, firmware updates, etc…</p>\n<p>In any case, back on the watch, you’ll see icons for whether it’s locked your heart rate (via the optical sensor), as well as location (via GPS). Also, if you have cycling accessories like a power meter or cadence sensor, it’ll let ya know whether or not those are locked. And if you’ve got an external heart rate sensor, Polar will change the HR icon outline to blue as opposed to green once the sensor is connected.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3897.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3897\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3897_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3897\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now, I’ve seen somewhat slower GPS reception on both the Vantage M2 and Ignite 2. The Ignite 2 has been far worse for me (as in, like up to 10 minutes horrible). But the M2 is still often taking 1-3 minutes to find GPS, which in 2021 is crazy pants long. Most other units of mine lock in a few seconds. I’ve escalated to Polar to let them troubleshoot.</p>\n<p>As for sensor types it supports, it’s the same as before, they are:</p>\n<p>– Bluetooth Smart Heart Rate Straps<br />\n– Bluetooth Smart Cycling Power Meters<br />\n– Bluetooth Smart Cycling Cadence &amp; Speed Sensors<br />\n– Bluetooth Smart Running Footpods<br />\n– Bluetooth Smart Running Power Meters</p>\n<p>Note that the Vantage M2 doesn’t have built-in running power meter support, as it lacks an altimeter. From a cycling power meter standpoint, I’ve mostly been using it with my Quarq DZero power meter, as it’s been fiddly with my pedal-based power meters. Sadly, there’s no support for ANT+ here at all. As such, pairing it to most smart trainers will be tricky, because you’ll need that single Bluetooth Smart connection to likely pair to Zwift/TrainerRoad/etc (unless using ANT+). Only Wahoo supports multiple concurrent Bluetooth Smart connections on their KICKR 2018/2020/CORE/BIKE models.</p>\n<p>To pair sensors, you’ll head to the general settings menu, and then sensors from there. As one interesting Polar aside, they actually automatically save sensors in your account and pre-pair them to your watch. Meaning, if you’ve got a Polar H10, it’ll actually automatically stick the sensor details into the watch when you turn it on. That’s great in 99% of use cases, but if you’ve lent that sensor to a friend/spouse/dog and plan to workout near them while they use that chest strap, be aware it’ll auto-pair to that. Again, the blue pairing icon on the start screen is your indicator that it’s using that instead of the optical sensor.</p>\n<p>Also on that pairing page is a settings icon. This is where you can adjust power settings, including the GPS recording rate (which increases GPS battery time). In general though, the data loss going from normal 1-second recording to 1-minute or 2-minute recording is massive. I wouldn’t EVER recommend that unless you *really knew* you were going to be well above normal GPS battery time, and only in cases where you’re moving super slow.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3899.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3899\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3899_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3899\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3900.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3900\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3900_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3900\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Oh, in that menu you can also turn off the optical HR sensor to save battery life, as well as turn on a lower screen update rate option to save battery life.</p>\n<p>You can also toggle on/off the backlight, as well as select a structured workout from your library. If you don’t have a structured workout saved you can create an interval timer on the watch itself. Like most on-watch interval systems, it’s fairly simple in that you specify either distance or time-based goals, however, there isn’t a way to set a recovery period. So it&#8217;s basically just like a repeating timer.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3901.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3901\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3901_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3901\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Note that on the Vantage M2 there is no route guidance/course following, unlike the Grit X or Vantage V2 series.</p>\n<p>In any event, with all that settled, we’ll hopefully have a lit-up series of sensor/GPS lights, and can get going by tapping the right center button to start the workout. From here you’ll see your data fields as you’ve configured them. Pace, distance, and other sensor metrics update in real-time as expected.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image001-2.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"clip_image001\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image001_thumb-2.jpg\" alt=\"clip_image001\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>To take a lap, you’ll press the lap button. I like how Polar has both distance-based laps as well as manual laps, and you can blend those two together after the fact in workout analysis.</p>\n<p>I didn’t have any issues seeing the display or buttons, all worked just fine for me –and visibility was just fine too – no issues there for my eyes, though, I can see how some would find the display a bit dark in certain scenarios. The backlight solves that, but ultimately it’s no different than previous Vantage displays.</p>\n<p>For cycling specifically, I did see some issues with the most recent Garmin power meter pedals, whereby it would drop the connection exactly every 2 minutes. I did not have this issue with the Quarq DZero. And while one might be tempted to assume that’s a Gamin problem, I don’t think that’s the case. Instead, it appears to be a power meter spec/pedal problem. For example, the Vantage M2 won’t even pair with my PowerTap P1 or P2 pedals. So I suspect there’s some sort of difference of opinion here that needs to be sorted out between the two companies. Hopefully they’ll do that.</p>\n<p>In any case, after you’re done suffering, you’ll get a workout summary screen with boatloads of data you can dive into. Here’s a quick gallery of all those screens:</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/03/polar-vantage-m2-in-depth-review.html/dsc_3905'><img width=\"200\" height=\"132\"

web. here’s an example of a track workout I did yesterday:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image-94.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image_thumb-94.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"658\" height=\"482\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Note: I effed up and hit pause as opposed to lap at the end of one of my intervals, hence the cut across the grass to the start of the next interval 200m later. My bad.)</em></p>\n<p>All of the splits/lap data is listed down below too, where you can see those 800’s, though, due to the GPS variance on the track, they were more like 840’s and 850’s according to Polar. I’d say it’s probably time for Polar to consider adding in a track mode like Garmin &amp; COROS.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image-95.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/image_thumb-95.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"216\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you’ve got sites like Strava, TrainingPeaks, and others set up, it’ll automatically get synced to them too, the second the workout uploads to Polar Flow.</p>\n<p>Now, we haven&#8217;t yet covered FuelWise or Nutrition energy sources, so let’s do that now. First, on that just completed workout, you’ll have seen the Nutrition/Energy sources. This is where you can see the breakdown of carbs, fats, and protein in your workout calories:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3915.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3915\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3915_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3915\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3916.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3916\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3916_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3916\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, the point of this is to then use it within the FuelWise functionality, which gives you smart reminds for carb refueling. To access that you need to choose Fueling from the main menu (lower left button) *BEFORE* you select a sport. Ideally they’d allow you to add it just like you add a structured workout, from the sport mode, but hey, beggars can’t be choosers. Once in there, you can choose what type of reminder to add:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3917.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3917\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3917_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3917\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Then, you’ll specify the estimated workout duration (time), as well as the size of your nutrition&#8217;s carb serving (in other words, how much per gel packet).</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3918.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3918\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3918_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3918\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3919.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3919\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3919_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3919\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Then once out during the workout it’ll give you reminders dynamically based on your normal fueling requirements from past data. If you go beyond your planned duration (perhaps because the Vantage M2 doesn’t have route navigation and you got horribly lost in the woods for 7 hours), it’ll keep giving you reminders dynamically until you hit stop. Whether or not you have the nutrition on-hand is definitely not Polar’s problem. They assume you can find yourself a 7-11 somewhere.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3921.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3921\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3921_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3921\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Shifting to more workout guidance, is FitSpark. This was added back in the original Polar Vantage M/V days, but it’s one of the more important pieces of the Polar puzzle. Basically, the idea behind this is to keep you doing something. First, it’ll skew towards Cardio or Strength workouts, and then after that, it’ll finish up with a Supportive workout (which is core/stretching typically). You’ll see this on your home watch face dashboards:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3922.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3922\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3922_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3922\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Each day it’ll give you a suggested cardio workout, and then after you’ve completed that it’ll give you a supportive or strength workout. These aren’t tied to a specific training plan (like building towards a marathon), but rather, aimed at giving you a ‘Workout of the day’ concept. And doing so in a way that doesn’t get you injured.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3923.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3923\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3923_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3923\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Depending on the type of workout you choose it’ll give you the specific steps and guidance in the watch itself. There are cardio-focused running workouts with different intensities. And then there are core type workouts too, and for those, it’ll give you the specific moves to do, along with animations and text for each one:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3924.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3924\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3924_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3924\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Again, if you’re on a structured training plan towards a specific-season race, this frankly isn’t for you. Instead, it’s for folks who don’t have a specific training plan, but just want to keep active in an endurance-sports focused manner. The watch won’t mess around, it’ll throw-down solid workout suggestions, so don’t think you’re just gonna get a bunch of 30-minute easy-peasy stretching workouts.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you’re on a structured training plan, then you’ll probably be using the Cardio Load status portions. But first, you’ve got the Weekly Training dashboard, which shows you your training load each week (it resets at seemingly/oddly noon on Mondays), inclusive of the exact HR zone breakdowns.</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3925.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3925\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3925_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3925\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3926.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3926\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3926_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3926\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3925.jpg\"> </a><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3927.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3927\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3927_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3927\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, in concert with that is the actual Cardio Load dashboard. This shows you whether or not your training is productive. On the main dashboard page you’ll see a quick overview:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3928.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3928\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3928_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3928\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>But once you dig into it, you’ll get the exact details of what it thinks about your workout habits:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3929.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3929\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3929_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3929\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Strain is a metric showing the average daily load from the past 7 days. Whereas Tolerance shows your average daily load from the past 28 days. So basically you can look at those two values and see the ratio as part of the number above it, such that it keeps things in check. Go too high, and you’re prone to injury. Too low, and you’re not going to make gains. In the middle, and life is grand.</p>\n<p>You can also view this same info on the Polar Flow app:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image00110-3.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"clip_image001[10]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image00110_thumb-3.png\" alt=\"clip_image001[10]\" width=\"357\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image00112-3.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"clip_image001[12]\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/clip_image00112_thumb-3.png\" alt=\"clip_image001[12]\" width=\"357\" height=\"771\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this is where we get to the biggest training difference between the Vantage M2 and the V2 – the lack of Recovery Tracking – called Recovery Pro. Though, that does require a chest strap at least three times a week to get the full Orthostatic test and associated recovery data. Still, you can use the Nightly Recharge data on the Vantage M2 (as discussed earlier in the basics section) as a pretty good proxy for recovery.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GPS &amp; HR Accuracy:</span></h3>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3932.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3932\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3932_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3932\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>There’s likely no topic that stirs as much discussion and passion as GPS accuracy.  A watch could fall apart and give you dire electrical shocks while doing so, but if it shows you on the wrong side of the road?  Oh hell no, bring on the fury of the internet!</p>\n<p>GPS accuracy can be looked at in a number of different ways, but I prefer to look at it using a number of devices in real-world scenarios across a vast number of activities.  I use 2-6 other devices at once, trying to get a clear picture of how a given set of devices handles conditions on a certain day.  Conditions include everything from tree/building cover to weather.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve continued to tweak my GPS testing methodology.  For example, I don’t place two units next to each other on my wrists, as that can impact signal. If I do so, I’ll put a thin fabric spacer of about 1”/3cm between them (I didn’t do that on any of my Polar Vantage M2 activities however, all workouts only had a single device per wrist).  But often I’ll simply carry other units by the straps, or attach them to the shoulder straps of my hydration backpack.  Plus, wearing multiple watches on the same wrist is well known to impact optical HR accuracy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, for HR accuracy testing I’m typically wearing a chest strap (usually the Garmin HRM-PRO, Wahoo TICKR FIT, Polar H10, or <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2020/01/polars-new-h9-heart-rate-strap-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.html\">Polar H9</a>) as well as another optical HR sensor watch on the bicep (lately the Scosche R2, Mio Pod, Whoop band, and/or Polar Verity Sense). Note that the numbers you see in the upper right corner are *not* the averages, but rather just the exact point my mouse is sitting over.  Note all this data is analyzed using the DCR Analyzer, <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/analyzer\">details here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>[Note: I’m just wrapping up typing up this full accuracy section, so you should see it today. The short version is that HR accuracy seemed to improve for me compared to the Vantage V2 – especially in cycling. I suspect this is likely as a result of <strong>not being the same sensor</strong> <strong>setup </strong>as the V2/Grit X. However, GPS accuracy wasn’t as good for me – and seemed to falter in places it shouldn’t have faltered. For those that are super-eager, you can actually find all the data sets, or at least the cycling ones, within my Garmin Rally review, where inside of that you can open up each set to see the HR/GPS data.]</em></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wrap Up:</span></h3>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3934.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3934\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/03/DSC_3934_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3934\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Overall this is a good update model from Polar. It’s not drastically different, but does keep things fresh – similar to what they did with the Polar Vantage V2 last year – and, more importantly, incorporates almost all of the features from that watch and the Grit X (at least, those that didn’t depend on a barometric altimeter. While there is that slight price increase from $279 to $299, I think that’s more than fair – especially since Garmin is mostly leaving this price range entirely to Polar and COROS – a mistake that I think will eventually flower as Garmin’s prices seem to continue to rise for multisport watches specifically. COROS has their Pace 2 watch, which is fantastic. However, it doesn’t have anywhere near the level of platform or app polish that Polar has, nor the depth in some of the features like the training load bits. Of course, it’s also $100 cheaper.</p>\n<p>Still, while the optical HR sensor accuracy improved on the Vantage M2 for me compared to other recent Polar watches, the GPS wasn’t as strong. Perhaps that’s something they can sort out, but it is a bit of a bummer. Moreover, as one who enjoys an occasional track workout, I think it’s time for Polar to look to add a track running mode, akin to what Garmin &amp; COROS both have – that would also have the side benefit of probably covering up some of the GPS stability issues on the track too.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, despite the minor quirks – it’s overall a very good option, and with the external/bezel/strap design refreshes, it looks less like a cheaper plastic watch and more like a premium sports watch. Add to that the heart rate broadcasting option rolling out to it later this year, and it fills in some of the indoor training gaps that Polar has had as well.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for reading!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"40719c93fe3af7df2410ee075be6ce869faa222a498958a25325300506303c09","category":"Cycling"}
