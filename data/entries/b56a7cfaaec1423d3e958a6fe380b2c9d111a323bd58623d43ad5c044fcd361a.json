We found no unexpected surprises with the sizing, but they’re so stretchy you’d be hard pushed to go far wrong.</p>\n<p>We’ve subjected several of these to years of abuse now as well as countless wash cycles and have no durability concerns to report.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/baselayers/brynje-super-thermo-c-shirt-baselayer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review of the Brynje Super Thermo C-Shirt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nordiclife.co.uk/collections/mens-base-layers/products/brynje-super-thermo-c-shirt\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Brynje Super Thermo C-Shirt from Nordic Outdoor</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Craft Advance Warm Fuseknit Intensity</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s most definitely a winter baselayer and way too hot for summer months.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"http://Andy%20McCandlish%20/%20Immediate%20Media\"><strong>Andy McCandlish / Immediate Media</strong></a></span></div>\n<ul><li>Men’s / Women’s</li>\n<li>£60</li>\n</ul><p>Craft’s baselayer won every one of our testers over with its excellent fit, bang-on cut and superb neck profile.</p>\n<p>The fabric backs this up with a ‘3D knit’ that gives a pleasantly chunky but not too heavy feel, boosting the thermal properties and making it feel more substantial for use in chilly weather.

For warmer weather, Craft has a thinner version available.</p>\n<p>Body-mapping is evident all over this highly technical top, with thicker fabric in certain areas for warmth and thinner fabric in others to allow sweatier regions to breathe better.</p>\n<p>It washes well, dries fast and is easy to care for. At £60 it’s pricey, but worth every penny if you want to stay warm and comfortable in cold conditions.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/baselayers/craft-advance-warm-fuseknit-intensity-baselayer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review of the Craft Advance Warm Fuseknit Intensity baselayer</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Giro Chrono</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Chrono became the baselayer to reach for when we were looking at hard days out on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Men’s</li>\n<li>£55 / $90 / €60</li>\n</ul><p>Straight out of its box the Giro looked tiny, but, testament to the stretch of the fabric, not only did it fit it was supremely comfortable and warm too. The body-hugging cut prevents sweaty and clammy patches, while the seamless torso means there’s no irritating stitching to cause hotspots when worn under bibs or backpacks.</p>\n<p>The more we wore it, the more we loved it as a terrific all-rounder. It’s not too hot and not too cool, and that’s the primary purpose of a baselayer – to keep you comfortable through a range of activity intensities and weather conditions.</p>\n<p>It copes admirably with the heat and sweat of high-intensity riding, but remains as comfortable as can be expected during the inevitable stops when you’re prone to chill. It wicks sweat efficiently, doesn’t hold on to moisture and the cut is perfectly suited to the riding position.</p>\n<p>Even though it looked small, the waist and sleeves stayed put and never rode up. With its mid-weight fabric it could certainly be used right through a UK winter from autumn to spring without overheating or undergunning.</p>\n<p>It isn’t cheap, but what you get is a tremendously durable and versatile baselayer that all our testers were unanimously positive about.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/baselayers/giro-chrono-long-sleeve-baselayer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review of the Giro Chrono baselayer</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Gore M Windstopper long-sleeve</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The quality of construction is excellent, as you’d expect from Gore.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Men’s/Women’s</li>\n<li>£69.99</li>\n</ul><p>The Gore M Swindstopper long-sleeve baselayer offers impressive sweat-wicking ability from its water-resistant and windproof polypropolene fabric.

Synthetic CoolMax material is knitted into a ribbed profile, allowing it to trap more air when other wind-resistant layers are worn on top and be reasonably cool when worn under a thin, wind-permeable riding jersey in the warmer months.</p>\n<p>As much as you need different layers for different seasons, this is one that could be used across a wide variety of temperatures and conditions.</p>\n<p>The fit is excellent, if a little small for the size, but it’s stretchy and body-hugging in all the right ways.

The fit is excellent, with areas of body-mapping giving warm or breathable panels where appropriate. For example, it’s perforated at the top of the neck and under the arms to let sweat escape.

Santini also makes a long-sleeved version of the same baselayer, which is definitely worth a look if your pockets are deep and the short-sleeved format doesn’t float your boat.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/baselayers/santini-grido-baselayer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review of the Santini Grido baselayer</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>How do baselayers work?</h2>\n<p>Some baselayers wick moisture away from the skin through capillary action (the fabric’s inner face has lots of tiny voids to make it porous), while others do it using hydrophilic coatings that work to actively draw moisture through the garment.</p>\n<p>Either way, the idea is to move moisture away from the skin, in order to help regulate body temperature.</p>\n<h2>What are baselayers made from?</h2>\n<h3>Polyester vs Merino wool</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some baselayers are made from Merino wool, a natural material that’s naturally odour resistant, but it doesn’t dry as quickly as polyester.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n</div>\n<p>Broadly speaking, baselayers are made from synthetic fibres (such as polyester blends) or natural fibres (in most cases, Merino wool).</p>\n<p>Synthetic fibres can be manufactured with hollow channels to aid the wicking process and can be incredibly efficient at moving sweat and drying quickly. The downside is that they get smelly fast, so most now come with some form of antibacterial treatment.</p>\n<p>Merino wool is naturally antibacterial, so it can be worn for extended periods without needing washing, and often feels luxuriously soft against the skin. However, it doesn’t wick as well, takes longer to dry and can feel damp next to your skin, although it does still maintain its ability to insulate.</p>\n<p>Many higher-end baselayers are now made from a mixture of wool and synthetic fibres, for the optimum combination of comfort and performance. This means they provide a lot of warmth at a lighter weight and dry faster than pure wool.</p>\n<h2>What to look for in a baselayer</h2>\n<div>\n<p>When it comes to choosing a baselayer there are other things to consider besides the material it’s made from.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to think about the fit, thickness of material used, warmth you’ll need from it and odour management.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Warmth (but not too much)</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some baselayers, like this one from Gore, incorporate windproof fabrics.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Baselayers provide warmth by trapping air next to the skin. This effect is due to the weave design, the fabric fibres used, or a mixture of both. The colder the conditions, the thicker the baselayer.</p>\n<p>How warm you want your baselayer depends on how warm you naturally are, and how warm you want to stay. Some folk can ride in sub-zero conditions with just a thin baselayer and a shell, while others need three inches of fleece just to go out in autumn.</p>\n<p>For ultimate warmth, some baselayers have a windproof panel integrated into the front, but this can come at the cost of breathability when you’re working hard.</p>\n<p>Baselayers aren’t just for cool or cold conditions, though. Many riders swear by baselayers throughout the year, even in the heat of summer, when a lightweight or mesh baselayer can help keep you comfortable by moving sweat away from the skin.</p>\n<h3>Long, short or no sleeves?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An important consideration is whether you want your baselayer to have long sleeves, short sleeves or no sleeves.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Assuming you want sleeves, the first thing to consider is how long you want them to be.</p>\n<p>You won’t want a long-sleeved baselayer if all your jerseys have short sleeves. In terms of versatility, short-sleeved baselayers will work with long- and short-sleeved jerseys but won’t be as warm in winter, and you may find the sleeves bunch up around your shoulders, especially underneath some of today’s closely tailored tops.</p>\n<p>Whether you prefer short or long sleeves, you’re better off going for ones that use a raglan design. Raglan sleeves extend over the shoulder and all the way up to the collar. The design provides more freedom of movement for your arms and uses a diagonal seam that runs from your armpit to your collarbone, rather than circling your shoulder.</p>\n<p>The other option is to go sleeveless. If you can’t bear to go without a baselayer on even the hottest days, a sleeveless, string-vest style garment might be the way to go.</p>\n<h3>As few seams and zips as possible</h3>\n<p>As a general rule, you want as few seams and zips as possible. The reason for that is simple: a baselayer is worn close to your skin, so you’ll want to avoid anything that might catch, nip, rub or irritate as much as possible.</p>\n<p>That said, you can’t avoid seams entirely so look for garments with seams in places that won’t interfere with your movements. Seams that are flatlock stitched rather than cover stitched are less likely to irritate the skin because the joint between fabric panels is level rather than lipped, so they’re the ones to seek out.</p>\n<p>Some fabrics use contour mapping, which changes the weave of the fabric so that the structure can map to the body’s shape without the need for numerous panels and seams.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aim for as few seams and zips as possible, to minimise skin irritation.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ben Delaney / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h3>Odour management</h3>\n<p>Baselayers do get smelly, so any material that delays the build-up of bacteria is a bonus. Merino naturally resists odours – wool fibres are smooth so there’s nowhere for bacteria to hide and fester.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the rougher fibres of synthetic baselayers are great for breeding bacteria. Some tops use a microbacterial treatment that fights them off for a bit, but within a few rides all synthetic tops will have a… certain nasal ambience.</p>\n<p>The answer is easy, of course – wash your baselayer(s) regularly – but it’s something worth considering if that’s not something you can do easily (on a multi-day tour or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a> trip, for example).</p>\n<p>Some high-tech synthetic tops use activated carbon-treated fabric to hold in the odours and release them during the wash and dry cycle.</p>\n<h3>Season-appropriate collars</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some winter baselayers have a high neck to seal warmth in.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some baselayers have high collars and are generally geared more towards winter use, so may be too warm to wear in the summer months.</p>\n<p>A lighter baselayer with a lower collar is more suitable for warmer weather and can be worn with a high-collared jersey/jacket and neck warmer when the mercury drops.</p>\n<h3>Longer hems</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A longer hem is helpful for keeping vital areas covered.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Phil Hall / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The bottom of the baselayer is just as important as the top and it’s worthwhile looking for one that extends down a little further than the typical top.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t necessarily need to be a cycling-specific cut, but a baselayer with a longer body provides more coverage and also more material to overlap, so you’re less likely to be exposed if your jersey rides up or shorts slide down.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, an articulated cut will ensure the sleeves follow the bend of your elbows when you’re in an active position on the bike, rather than being left straight. This is generally comfier and prevents the fabric from riding up or bunching.</p>\n<p>Thumb loops on long-sleeve baselayers can help keep your hands warmer in winter. They are also great for holding your sleeves in place when you’re layering up or wearing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">winter gloves</a> on top.</p>\n<h3>Caring for your baselayer</h3>\n<p>For the most part, baselayers can be thrown in the wash with the rest of your gear, but given that they’re usually made of soft materials it’s best to avoid washing them in the same load as garments with Velcro because snags can potentially ruin a baselayer.</p>\n<p>If you’re worried about snags, consider using a wash bag (or, if you don’t have one, a pillowcase also works).</p>\n<p>To limit a baselayer’s smelliness you may want to wash them in hot water to get rid of any stowaway stinky bacteria. But be sure to check the washing instructions before you put them in a hot wash because Merino can shrink at high temps. Also, take note of drying instructions because this can shrink baselayers too.</p>\n<p>If you’ve got a baselayer that can’t be washed in hot water but smells like you’ve just worn it on a five-hour ride fresh out of the washing machine, Nikwax and Grangers make detergents specifically to take care of the odour-causing bacteria that can build up on your wicking layer. Assos and Rapha also make similar active washes.</p>","author":"BikeRadar","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b56a7cfaaec1423d3e958a6fe380b2c9d111a323bd58623d43ad5c044fcd361a","category":"Cycling"}
