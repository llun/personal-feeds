(I won’t infect the rest of your day with an example.) Some explanations in science seem to be the earworm equivalent: inherently intuitive, making them stick readily in the mind. That’s obviously the case for the hypothesis that a warming Arctic leads to a wigglier jet stream, producing weather extremes in the mid-latitudes like the recent epic cold snap in the central US.</p>\n<p>The cold arrived after the spinning “polar vortex” in the upper atmosphere above the Arctic was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/02/16/setup-arctic-outbreak-niziol/\">disturbed in January</a>, unleashing its contents southward as the jet stream detoured from its usual commute. Could this behavior actually be a consequence of global warming? The suggestion has appeared in news articles and Twitter threads across the land. But the idea is stickier than the science says it should be.</p>\n<h2>Jet setting</h2>\n<p>Although the specifics vary, the general idea is based on the fact that the Arctic is warming faster than the mid-latitudes. As a result, the temperature difference between them is getting a little smaller. The jet stream forms at the boundary between the Arctic and mid-latitude air, so a smaller temperature difference would weaken the jet stream. And a weaker jet stream is more prone to great, wiggling meanders that can bring you cold air from the north or warm air from the south.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744196#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744196&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scott K.
