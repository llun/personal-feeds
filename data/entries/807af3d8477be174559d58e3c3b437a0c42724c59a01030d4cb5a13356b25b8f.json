The paper reports that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://rockleyphotonics.com&amp;xcust=1-1-345166-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">British firm Rockley Photonics</a> has revealed in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-105235/&amp;xcust=1-1-345166-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">IPO listing documents</a> that Apple is its largest customer, ramping up speculation that the next Apple Watch will include the start-up’s next-gen sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rockley Photonics makes “ultra-accurate sensors that read multiple blood signals that are typically only detectable using medical equipment, by beaming infrared light through the skin from a module on the back of a smartwatch,” The Telegraph reports. Among the uses for such a sensor would be tracking blood pressure, glucose, and alcohol levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234682/apple-watch-series-6-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 6 gained the ability to monitor blood-oxygen levels</a> via a new Sp02 sensor and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231935/apple-watch-series-4-review-the-biggest-upgrade-yet.html\">Series 4 gained an ECG sensor</a> built into the Digital Crown. Those features are available on other watches from Fitbit and Samsung, but no consumer wearable is able to measure such advanced health metrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Telegraph reports that Apple has accounted for the majority of Rockley’s revenue over the past two years, so Apple has been working with the firm for a while. The two companies have “an ongoing “supply and development agreement,” which Rockley expects to continue, according to the filing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rockley CEO Andrew Rickman said he expected his technology to be featured in consumer products next year, but declined to name the product or the company. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230066/tim-cook-is-testing-a-new-apple-watch-device-that-monitors-his-blood-sugar-monitor.html\">Tim Cook has long espoused</a> the Apple Watch’s healthcare implications and has made glucose monitoring a long-term goal for the wearable.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"807af3d8477be174559d58e3c3b437a0c42724c59a01030d4cb5a13356b25b8f","category":"Apple"}
