But both lawsuits seem to be operating on a fundamental misunderstanding regarding the mechanics of how \"retail\" competition works in the market for downloadable console games.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/sony-faces-lawsuit-over-alleged-monopoly-pricing-of-playstation-downloads/\">the previous lawsuit filed by Westerman Law Corp</a>, this <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/0001-2021-05-07-Complaint.pdf\">new lawsuit filed by the Saveri Law Firm</a> focuses almost exclusively on the Digital Edition (DE) of the PlayStation 5, which is sold without a disc drive. On this hardware, the suit argues, \"consumers... are left with two choices: purchase games directly from Sony using the PlayStation Store, or purchase another console for hundreds of dollars.\"</p>\n<p>The Digital Edition and the Standard Edition of the PS5 are not interchangeable markets, the suit argues, because of the \"large price discount\" of $100 for the Digital Edition hardware. The suit argues that a consumer faced with a legally relevant \"small but significant and non-transitory increase in price\" in digital games on the PS5 \"would not transition away from the PS5 DE to the PS5.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766234#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766234&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"39b9d0a3b1c0e8fa7d328071352ea9adff9ebb68a598eb7b57775a8fbb2910e9","category":"Tech"}
