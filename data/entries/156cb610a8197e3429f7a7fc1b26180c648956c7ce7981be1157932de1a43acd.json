Similar to credit cards and boarding passes, digital car keys are stored in the Wallet app on devices running iOS 13.6 and watchOS 6.2.8 or later. So far, the feature is only compatible with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/bmw-digital-car-key-details/\">select BMW models</a> manufactured after July 1, 2020.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith support for Ultra Wideband, Digital Key 3.0 will enable hands-free, location-aware keyless access to vehicles and other location-aware features for an improved user experience. The specification will allow Apple to improve its Car Key feature so that users can unlock and start a compatible vehicle without taking their iPhone out of their pocket. NFC will continue to be supported as a \"mandatory back-up solution.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe improved Ultra Wideband version of Apple's Car Key feature would require devices with the U1 chip like iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBMW previously announced plans to offer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/bmw-digital-key-plus-ultra-wideband/\">Digital Key Plus</a>, an enhanced version of Apple's Car Key feature, in its new iX electric vehicle. BMW said the feature would be available in Europe starting in late 2021 and in North America by early 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to providing a hands-free, location-aware experience, BMW said Ultra Wideband's precision would ensure that relay attacks, where the radio signal is jammed or intercepted, are not possible, resulting in improved security.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"Digital Key Release 3.0 addresses security and usability by authenticating the Digital Key between a vehicle and the mobile device over Bluetooth Low Energy and then establishing a secure ranging session with UWB, which allows the vehicle to perform secure and accurate distance measurement to localize the mobile device,\" said the Car Connectivity Consortium.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple previously said the new version of its Car Key feature with Ultra Wideband support would be available in 2021, but an exact timeframe is unknown.
