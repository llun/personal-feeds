[credit:\n                        OnePlus                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>OnePlus' latest cheap phone launching in North America is the \"OnePlus Nord N200 5G.\" The phone is a follow-up to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/oneplus-brings-a-90hz-smartphone-to-the-us-for-180/\">$180 Nord N100</a> from last year, and with OnePlus' customary yearly price increases, the N200 is up to a still-dirt-cheap $240.</p>\n<p>Considering <a href=\"https://fave.co/3xlsiJq\" target=\"_blank\">the $240 price</a>, it sounds like you're getting a pretty capable entry-level phone. The phone has a 6.49-inch, 90 Hz 1080p display; 4GB of RAM; 128GB of storage; and a 5000 mAh battery with 18 W charging. The pictures show a side fingerprint reader, a USB-C port, and a headphone jack. The SoC is a Snapdragon 480, an 8 nm, eight-core SoC with four ARM Cortex A76 cores and four A55 cores.</p>\n<p>The phone (and those specs) are official today, but for some reason, OnePlus isn't releasing a full spec list. For that, leaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1404128722211516417/photo/1\">Evan Blass</a> fills in the blanks. Blass says the phone will have a 2400×1080 LCD, NFC, a microSD slot, and sub-6 GHz 5G support (not mmWave), which is expected at this price point. Blass' specs also fill in the details on the rear camera lineup, which features a 13MP main camera and two 2MP \"Macro\" and \"Monochrome\" cameras that we're going to call \"purely decorative.\" Phone manufacturers think multiple cameras are an important selling point for phones, even if the additional cameras do almost nothing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773462#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773462&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30c2ed4c3305a42056478182097c19e1c77555c0ab941104b36eb71154e16ac8","category":"Tech"}
