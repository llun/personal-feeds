Bezos made his fortune at Amazon through competitive pricing and timely delivery of goods to his customers worldwide. But so far at least, his Blue Origin space company has been a less reliable vendor.</p>\n<p>This has been especially of concern to United Launch Alliance, which is relying on Blue Origin-built engines for its new Vulcan rocket. The US Space Force is also watching, as it is counting on the Vulcan booster to help launch some of its most precious satellites into orbit. Blue Origin's powerful BE-4 rocket engine, which burns methane and liquid oxygen, is years late.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778296#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778296&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a900b87dd76c88956be156eb63e0a97297c23e7a38c4c0579587258c9217e581","category":"Tech"}
