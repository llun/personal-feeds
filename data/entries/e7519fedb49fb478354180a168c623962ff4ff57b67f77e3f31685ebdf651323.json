Well, in this case GCN (Global Cycling Network) took the new ROUTT RSL<span id=\"more-36182\"></span> and ROUTT 45 on a Royal Gravel Epic right out their front door.  A simple two day, one night out on the bikes to feel the freedom of bike packing.  Sleeping where ever you end up and unplugging from the constant challenge that is a 2020.  Grab a pint, make some coffee and snuggle up with a couple of nice videos that the crew put out late this Fall.  We hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"A Royal Gravel Epic | Bike Packing The King Alfred&#039;s Way\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKWuRIcP3J0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Si&#039;s Moots Routt RSL Titanium Gravel Bike &amp; Bikepacking Kit Check For The King Alfred&#039;s Way\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DWklI-nqlrI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Check out more on the ROUTT RSL and ROUTT 45 here:  <a href=\"https://moots.com/routt-family-of-gravel-bikes-get-wide/\">ROUTT GRAVEL FAMILY GETS WIDE</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moots.com/routt-45-and-routt-rsl-on-gcns-the-king-alfreds-way-gravel-epic/\">ROUTT 45 AND ROUTT RSL ON GCN&#8217;S THE KING ALFRED&#8217;S WAY GRAVEL EPIC</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots</a>.</p>","author":"Jon Cariveau","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"e7519fedb49fb478354180a168c623962ff4ff57b67f77e3f31685ebdf651323","category":"Cycling"}
