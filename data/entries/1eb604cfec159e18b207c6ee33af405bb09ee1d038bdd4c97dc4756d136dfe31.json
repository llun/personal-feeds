CEO Steve Burns has claimed that Lordstown already has more than 100,000 pre-orders—enough to keep its Ohio factory busy for more than a year once the company starts production. In reality, these pre-orders are non-binding. And Hindenburg claims that some of the supposed customers don't seem to have the financial resources to make good on their multi-million dollar orders even if they wanted to.</p>\n<p>Hindenburg is in the business of selling a company's stock short and then publishing damaging research about the firm. If the stock falls, the company makes a profit. That strategy seems to be working with Lordstown. As I write this, Lordstown's stock is down about 15 percent for the day.</p>\n\n<p>The company made its name with a September exposé of another electric truckmaker, Nikola. Hindenburg's report revealed that a promotional video of the Nikola One truck \"in motion\" actually showed it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/nikola-admits-prototype-was-rolling-downhill-in-promotional-video/\">rolling down a hill</a>, with the camera tilted slightly so it appeared to be driving on level ground. Nikola's stock has fallen about 60 percent since Hindenburg published its initial report.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749211#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749211&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
