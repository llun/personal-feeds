While the quality of the webcam itself hasn't changed, Apple says that thanks to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> and its latest image signal processor, image quality is improved on the MacBooks. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's worth noting that \"Dylandkt\" has provided accurate information in the past. In November, five months before Apple announced its new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, the account stated that Apple would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1326956166790909954\">bring the M1 chip to its next-generation iPad</a>, which turned out to be accurate. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA few days before Apple's \"Spring Loaded\" event, which included the release of the redesigned 24-inch ‌iMac‌, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1383453651285381122\">account posted</a> that the new Mac would feature an ‌M1‌ chip, rather than an upgraded \"M1X\" iteration.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore recently, the account claimed that the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a>\" chip will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/m2-macbook-air-to-arrive-in-2022/\">debut in updated and colorful MacBook Airs next year</a>. The account added that the \"M1X\" chip is being reserved for high-end \"Pro\" Macs. Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/kuo-macbook-pro-mass-production-third-quarter/\">expected to announce its redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> with an upgraded Apple silicon processor, a new design, and more this fall. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dylandkt/\">dylandkt</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/11/macbook-pro-14-and-16-upgraded-webcam/\">Upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro Rumored to Feature Upgraded 1080p Webcam</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-rumored-to-feature-upgraded-1080p-webcam.2303903/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sd-g_QQWh3o:uY2EzxRHVlE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sd-g_QQWh3o:uY2EzxRHVlE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/sd-g_QQWh3o\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c7f987fd7d62dc9d1dc1ba3e0693e6b755e9b13fd1472bb7e49db49453ada671","category":"Apple"}
