ENVE’s Open House, aka the <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/grodeo/\" target=\"_blank\">Builder Round-Up and Grodeo event</a> is this weekend in Ogden, Utah, so I packed up my bike portrait kit and drove up through beautiful summer monsoons to document a selection of bikes from this year’s event. Check out a thoroughly documented stable from the Round Up below, beginning with Chumba, Falconer, Firefly, Mariposa, Scarab, Sklar, and Tomii…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Chumba-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Chumba-16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Chumba-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chumbausa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chumba Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chumbausa/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@ChumbaUSA</a></p>\n<p>This titanium Sendero is welded in Austin, Texas at Chumba’s facilities and features a brand-spankin’ new 3D-printed titanium yoke. If you thought the steel Sendero was fun, watch out! This singlespeed is easy on the eyes and featherweight. This frame features a bead-blasted, masked, and polished finish. Chumba has really delivered here with a dream bike no matter who you ask…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Falconer-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Falconer-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Falconer-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://falconercycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Falconer Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/CoffeeAndEggs/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@CoffeeAndEggs</a></p>\n<p>Cameron Falconer really outdid himself this time with a proper cruiser, complete with a Bendix hub, custom bent bars, and an integrated, minimal front rack. The rack is a piece of titanium that Cam bent, drilled, and welded into a shape that can carry goods with ease. It’s then bolted to the headtube via some custom brackets welded into place. For such a minimal bike, it has plenty to keep your head spinnin’ like those Campy MTB pedals!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Firefly-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Firefly-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Firefly-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fireflybicycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefly Bicycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/Fireflybicycles\" target=\"_blank\">@FireflyBicycles</a></p>\n<p>Custom built in Firefly’s Boston workshop for their master machinist, Josh Ogle, this Ti All-Road bike features internal dynamo light wiring and integrated lighting; a modified SRAM sprint shifter to connect to his Di2 shifters and operate the wireless AXS Reverb dropper post; custom <a href=\"https://rockgeist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rockgeist frame bags</a> with integrated bag mounts; Z-couplers in the frame and a Formula hydraulic brake line coupler for easier travel; and a custom derailleur cage made by Josh to allow us to use a Shimano 11-42 cassette with their 2x drivetrain components. It’s then finished off with Firefly’s custom “glitch” graphics.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Mariposa-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Mariposa-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Mariposa-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mariposabicycles.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Mariposa Bicycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mariposabicycles\" target=\"_blank\">@MariposaBicycles</a></p>\n<p>Founded in 1969 in Toronto, Mariposa Bicycles specializes in fillet-brazed and lugged constructed steel bikes that are very much built the same way they were back when they started. This bicycle was designed for off-road adventure touring and backpacking. The frame was fillet brazed with a mixture of Columbus tubing and was designed to accommodate 1x Shimano GRX Di2 components, a front hub generated dynamo lighting system with internal light wiring, and three bottle cages. The ENVE Adventure Fork has bosses for a light and accessories. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Scarab-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Scarab-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Scarab-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scarabcycles.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">Scarab Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/scarabcycles\" target=\"_blank\">@ScarabCycles</a></p>\n<p>I can’t even tell you how stoked I was to finally see a Scarab in person! These bikes are made in Colombia and feature some of the wildest paintjobs I’ve ever seen. This gravel bike has a menagerie of animals painted on it, including <em>dendrobates</em> frogs, flamingos, hummingbirds, and various rainforest flora. It is hands down my favorite frame finish in the entire show.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Sklar-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Sklar-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Sklar-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sklarbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sklar Bikes</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sklarbikes\" target=\"_blank\">@SklarBikes</a></p>\n<p>With the pandemic causing all sorts of supply chain issues, a few of us joked that it was time for bikes to go back to their simplest forms: singlespeed, fixed gear, and coaster brake. Adam’s affinity for fixed gear gravel bikes spills over into this beauty of a swoopy machine. Complete with riser bars, the <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/product/adventure-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE Adventure fork</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sim.works/collections/racks-simworks-by-nitto\" target=\"_blank\">Sim Works rack</a>, and yeah, that’s a 6-bolt fixed cog mounted to a backward wheel…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Tomii-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Tomii-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Tomii-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tomiicycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tomii Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tomiicycles\" target=\"_blank\">@TomiiCycles</a></p>\n<p>Nao Tomii makes some seriously stunning eye candy and this Fat Canvas is just another example of his craft. What caught my eye about this bike is the salmon-colored finish, the subtle saguaro on the brake bridge, the custom rack, <a href=\"https://www.andrewthemaker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew the Maker</a> bag, and his beautiful head badge. I knew Tomii would be here this year and as always, his bikes are such a pleasure to document.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p><em>Check back throughout the weekend for more updates from the 2021 ENVE Builder Round Up!</em></p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6aa897ee81deaa1f3a447d7075f9a0e3475332c13632679f3d91be85aef1cd8a","category":"Cycling"}
