{"title":"Todd Howard is finally ready to share some Starfield details","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773383","date":1623706783000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>\"Into the Starfield\" promo video. </p></div>\n<p>Over the weekend, Bethesda revealed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/starfield-reveal-coming-november-11-2022-exclusively-to-pc-xbox-series-x-s/\">the first pre-rendered trailer for <em>Starfield</em></a>, giving us a glimpse of a game that has existed publicly as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/bethesda-at-e3-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-confirmed-for-next-generation/\">nothing more than a title since 2018</a>. While the atmospheric trailer effectively establishes mood and hints at the wider universe of <em>Starfield</em>, it offers few details of how that universe works or what the player's role in it will be.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Bethesda Director Todd Howard has offered additional details through interviews to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/06/13/starfield-bethesda/\">The Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/starfield-world-exclusive-e3-2021-trailer-secrets-revealed-legendary/\">The Telegraph</a>. In those interviews, Howard describes <em>Starfield</em> as being set \"300-ish\" years in the future, and he says the team has taken pains to map out a \"what happens every decade\" history that gets humanity from now to then.</p>\n<p>That kind of attention to detail was a recurring theme in Howard's new interviews. \"We start with the world and questions like 'What do they eat? What do they write with? How do they order their books?'\" Howard told The Telegraph. He also noted that \"we want to know what all the buttons do\" on the complicated control panel shown in the trailer. \"We model all the buttons... every button, I think, is labelled in the ship.\" That doesn't mean players will necessarily be responsible for flipping all those toggles, but it's nice to know <em>someone</em> is thinking about them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773383#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773383&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"511408bdbf8621b654752a810c892898a31cade1dfaf685cc4b860c1d3085659","category":"Tech"}
