It doesn't help that there's widespread public confusion, particularly when it comes to the one-two combo of adaptive cruise control and lane keeping and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/cop-arrests-apparently-sleeping-tesla-driver-going-93mph/\">whether they allow a driver to nap on the freeway</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, a series of tests involving a large pink teddy bear, wearing a high-vis vest while strapped to the back of a moving car, has shown that using adaptive cruise and lane keeping—known in industry jargon as \"SAE Level 2 automation\"—can help increase a driver's situational awareness. However, the effect required some familiarity with such systems. The study was performed by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/api/datastoredocument/bibliography/2220\">and published earlier this month</a>.</p>\n<h2>You’re adapting my what?</h2>\n<p>When activated, adaptive cruise control uses forward-looking radar to maintain a specific distance to a vehicle in the lane ahead, slowing down or speeding up (to a maximum of whatever speed cruise control was set to) as necessary. Lane-keeping systems use forward-looking cameras to detect the lane markings on a road to keep the vehicle between them, and when both are active together, the vehicle will do a pretty good facsimile of driving itself, albeit with extremely limited situational awareness.<!--adbreak--></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748629#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748629&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
