Realms are containerized, isolated execution environments, completely opaque to both operating system and hypervisor. The hypervisor itself will only be responsible for scheduling and resource allocation. Realms themselves are to be managed by the <code>realm manager</code>—a new concept that can apparently be implemented in 1/10th the code required for a hypervisor.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753363#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753363&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54f3ebadf5314b7b13089f2dcb83aa419c14e854a8f45e74a372d08b9761850d","category":"Tech"}
