The new coverage must be purchased within 30 days of the end date of the original coverage, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPreviously, there was no way to extend AppleCare+ coverage for a Mac once the initial three-year coverage window elapsed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAppleCare+ for Mac provides up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other damage. Customers with an active AppleCare+ plan also have 24/7 priority access to Apple's technical support representatives by online chat or phone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAppleCare+ coverage for Mac remains capped at three years outside of the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Elijah!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/applecare-for-mac-extended-coverage/\">AppleCare+ Coverage for Mac Can Now Be Extended Beyond Three Years</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UwO5XNfjR_E:W9sdMniGNdw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UwO5XNfjR_E:W9sdMniGNdw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UwO5XNfjR_E\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"010420676f266c23cf74e3d323b3325c8cab5ff9ac1e6bfea08f507939e05cb9","category":"Apple"}
