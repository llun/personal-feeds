{"title":"Kara Swisher on Trump’s Continuing Exile From Facebook","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/opinion/trump-facebook-oversight-board.html","date":1620401215000,"content":"\n<p>Kara Swisher, writing at The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In general, I have considered the case of Mr. Trump to be much\nless complex than people seem to think. And it has been made\nto appear highly complicated by big tech companies like\nFacebook because they want to exhaust us all in a noisy and\nintractable debate.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Trump should be seen as an outlier — a lone, longtime rule\nbreaker who was coddled and protected on social media platforms\nuntil he wandered into seditious territory. He’s an unrepentant\ngamer of Facebook’s badly enforced rules who will never change. He\ngot away with it for years and spread myriad self-serving lies far\nand wide. […]</p>\n\n<p>In moving the key decision over Mr. Trump out of its own hands\n(where it belonged), the company has passed along the hottest of\npotatoes and said good riddance to responsibility. Facebook is\npretending that its hands are tied, even though Facebook\nexecutives were the ones who tied them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I, for one, would never have bet that Jack Dorsey would be the one who finally dealt with Trump’s abuse decisively, and that Mark Zuckerberg would be the one who looks utterly feckless. I think Zuckerberg was hoping that Trump would just fade from relevancy once he was out of office. That clearly hasn’t happened, and it’s not going to happen over the next six months, either. Zuckerberg needs to make a decision now.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/07/swisher-trump-facebook\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"78c67506576013872cdab3b30e5e97dc83f7d09078b083a7052431e585669212","category":"Tech"}
