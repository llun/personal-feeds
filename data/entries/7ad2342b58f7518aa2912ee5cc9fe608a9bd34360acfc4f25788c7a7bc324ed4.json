The culprit: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_giant_hornet\">Asian giant hornet</a> (<em>Vespa mandarinia</em>), a species native to southeast Asia and parts of the Russian far East. Somehow, these so-called \"murder hornets\" had found their way to the Pacific Northwest, where they posing a dire ecological threat to North American honeybee populations.</p>\n<p>The story of the quest to track and eradicate the hornets before their numbers became overwhelming is the subject of a new documentary: <a href=\"https://www.discovery.com/dnews/murder-hornets-are-subject-of-upcoming-discovery--documentary-\"><em>Attack of the Murder Hornets</em></a>, now streaming on Discovery+.

The hornet has a venomous, extremely painful sting—and its stinger is long enough to puncture traditional beekeeping suits. Conrad Berube, a beekeeper and entomologist who had the misfortune to be stung seven times while exterminating a murder hornet nest, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html\">told The New York Times</a>, \"It was like having red-hot thumbtacks being driven into my flesh.\" And while Japanese honeybees, for example, have evolved defenses against the murder hornet, North American honeybees have not, as the slaughter of McFall's colony aptly demonstrated.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744035#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744035&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ad2342b58f7518aa2912ee5cc9fe608a9bd34360acfc4f25788c7a7bc324ed4","category":"Tech"}
