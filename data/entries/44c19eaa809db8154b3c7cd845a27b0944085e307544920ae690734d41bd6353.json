In each of the three drawings on June 21, July 6, and July 19, six individuals will win $1,000; four will win $5,000; and two will win $50,000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really do love the idea of these lotteries and <a href=\"https://lcb.wa.gov/pressreleases/lcb-allows-joints-for-jabs-promotions\">giveaway promotions</a>. It’s innumeracy that leads some people to grossly miscalculate the risks vs. rewards of getting vaccinated, and it’s innumeracy that leads people to play lotteries. Sweepstakes for getting vaccinated put innumeracy to work.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/07/philly-vax-sweepstakes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"44c19eaa809db8154b3c7cd845a27b0944085e307544920ae690734d41bd6353","category":"Tech"}
