The YouTuber did not have a 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ on hand to see what the backlighting looks like behind the White keys.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of the White finish, which some customers have been concerned may attract dirt or fingerprints, the YouTuber said that it \"looks like there might be a chance for it to get dirty\" and he's \"interested in seeing how it's going to hold up.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the spring of 2020, Apple unveiled the Magic Keyboard for ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌, which is similar to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/\">Smart Keyboard</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> but with a built-in trackpad for better navigation using a cursor. It was originally only available in Black, but Apple is now offering an optional White color option alongside its latest ‌iPad Pro‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch ‌‌‌iPad Pro‌‌‌ costs $299 and the Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch ‌‌‌iPad Pro‌‌‌ costs $349. The Magic Keyboards can be purchased from Apple's online store, with layouts for over 30 languages.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOver the weekend, a Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/16/m1-ipad-pro-arrives-early-for-customer/\">received their M1 12.9-inch iPad Pro early</a>, long before the official launch date on May 21 and even the lifting of press embargoes about the new models, allowing for a first look at the machine and its mini-LED display.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/unboxing/\">unboxing</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/first-white-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-unboxing/\">First White Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro Unboxing Surfaces Online</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-white-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-unboxing-surfaces-online.2296463/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bKY4Fdcx7sI:BT8lU0qexPU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bKY4Fdcx7sI:BT8lU0qexPU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bKY4Fdcx7sI\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9bd2e84aee5fb7fa0f16808c64d23ef84a3f1b29f88c1193efdf0c3995decf84","category":"Apple"}
