{"title":"Last Intel-Based Mac Pro Refresh Likely Referenced in macOS 11.4 RC","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/intel-mac-pro-refresh-hinted-by-mac-os-update/","date":1621338774000,"content":"<em>Bloomberg</em> reported in January that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-two-new-mac-pro-models/\">Apple is working on a successor to the current Mac Pro</a> that will feature an Intel processor rather than an Apple silicon chip. Now, a reference to an unreleased 10-core Intel i9 processor has been discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevemoser\">Steve Moser</a> in the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/macos-big-sur-11-4-rc/\">macOS Big Sur 11.4 RC update</a>, released yesterday.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/mac_pro_2019_roundup_header-b.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/01/unreleased-imac-comet-lake-geekbench/\">10-core Intel chip appeared in Geekbench scores last July, running on an iMac</a>. Last month, Apple introduced the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> featuring an Apple silicon chip. Given that announcement, the company is unlikely to update its ‌iMac‌ line with any more Intel chip offerings but instead focus on Apple silicon. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>, however, used by higher-end professional users, could be one of the final Macs that gets updated with Apple silicon. In the meantime for those higher-end users, Apple may update its current ‌Mac Pro‌ design with a newer Intel processor, such as the one referenced in the latest macOS update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says its transition to Apple silicon, which began this past November, will take at least two years, and the highest-end, professional ‌Mac Pro‌ could be one of the last Macs that gets updated. For the eventual high-end Apple silicon chip, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Apple is testing chips with as many as 32 high performance cores.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/intel-mac-pro-refresh-hinted-by-mac-os-update/\">Last Intel-Based Mac Pro Refresh Likely Referenced in macOS 11.4 RC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/last-intel-based-mac-pro-refresh-likely-referenced-in-macos-11-4-rc.2296622/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UeH9MGdsHOg:8uGoilJNSBs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UeH9MGdsHOg:8uGoilJNSBs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UeH9MGdsHOg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1a70a1f0627c537cf342ab1b0e9ad500998846509f80301ce550bd376578bf34","category":"Apple"}
