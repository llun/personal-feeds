The Beats Studio Buds are comparatively tiny, with a design that's similar to in-ear earbuds from companies like Samsung and Google.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Beats-Studio-Buds-feature-3.75.jpg\" /><em><div>A render of what the Beats Studio Buds will look like</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\nThe casing of the Beats Studio Buds is depicted in the images shared by <em>MySmartPrice</em>, with the silicone tips and internal components missing, though cutouts in the casing will house sensors and other components. The oval-shaped case that will charge the Studio Buds is not shown, but it was previously found in iOS 14.6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Animations of Beats Studio Buds: ðŸ§µ <a href=\"https://t.co/XYVvYP7ez3\">pic.twitter.com/XYVvYP7ez3</a></p>â€” Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1394361761571254272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe design of the Beats Studio Buds is interesting because its similar to what we're expecting to see from the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>. Rumors indicate that the next â€ŒAirPods Proâ€Œ will feature a rounded, compact design that's stemless.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe don't yet know when the Beats Studio Buds might launch, but given that Apple has sought FCC approval, we could see a launch in the near future.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/beats-studio-buds-leaked-images/\">Upcoming Beats Studio Buds Depicted in Leaked Images</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-beats-studio-buds-depicted-in-leaked-images.2297788/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S-Jf9ZTKlEo:8xF-rmE9Qgw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S-Jf9ZTKlEo:8xF-rmE9Qgw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/S-Jf9ZTKlEo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"71ee776c3831f2ef47a0da89d276ac38a76cb4fe947cb0cc23831ab1c435affa","category":"Apple"}
