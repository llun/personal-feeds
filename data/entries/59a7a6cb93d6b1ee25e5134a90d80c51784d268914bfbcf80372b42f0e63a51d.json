{"title":"Alex Berenson: The Pandemic’s Wrongest Man","link":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/pandemics-wrongest-man/618475/","date":1618339709000,"content":"\n<p>Derek Thompson, writing for The Atlantic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To be honest, I initially had serious doubts about publishing this piece. The trap of exposing conspiracy theories is obvious: To demonstrate why a theory is wrong, you have to explain it and, in doing so, incur the risk that some people will be convinced by the very theory you’re trying to debunk. But that horse has left the barn. More than half of Republicans under the age of 50 say they <a href=\"https://civiqs.com/results/coronavirus_vaccine?annotations=true&amp;uncertainty=true&amp;zoomIn=true&amp;party=Republican&amp;age=65%2B\">simply won’t get a vaccine</a>. Their hesitancy is being fanned by right-wing hacks, Fox News showboats, and vaccine skeptics like Alex Berenson. The case for the vaccines is built upon a firm foundation of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/how-mrna-technology-could-change-world/618431/\">scientific discovery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-publication-results-landmark\">clinical-trial data</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html\">real-world evidence</a>. The case against the vaccines wobbles because it is built upon a steaming pile of bullshit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An evisceration for the ages. Keep this bookmarked in case anyone sends you links to Berenson’s anti-J&amp;J vaccine nonsense today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/thompson-on-berenson\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"59a7a6cb93d6b1ee25e5134a90d80c51784d268914bfbcf80372b42f0e63a51d","category":"Tech"}
