It is accessed via a door in the base of the tube.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-ep8-33aa907.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Shimano EP8 motor has a custom power tune for the Megawatt.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-shimano-display-ef2961f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Battery level, power mode and speed are shown on the Shimano display.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-on-off-button-b1f678c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>On or off – select here.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-charge-port-5fbb910.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Shimano charge port is neatly located above the bottom bracket.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe battery is held in a one-piece cast motor housing, while the down tube’s shape is designed to give the strength and stiffness needed, whilst also allowing for that battery accessibility.\n<p>Nukeproof has tuned the power curves of the motor, giving riders two power profiles to chose from: Power and Range.</p>\n<p>In the Power profile, the Assist Character, Max Torque and Assist Start settings are all one or two stages higher than those in the Range profile.</p>\n<p>This should give it a more aggressive feel under the pedals in all three power modes (Eco, Trail, Boost). As you’d expect, in Range, the bike should feel a little more muted, but battery range is extended.</p>\n<h2>Nukeproof Megawatt geometry</h2>\n<p>Five sizes of the Megawatt will be offered, from Small to XXL, so virtually all riders should be able to squeeze onto a bike, especially with its smaller 27.5in rear wheel meaning less squeaky bum time on the steeps for shorter-legged riders.</p>\n<p>Nukeproof says there should be a bike to suit riders from 5ft 2in/159cm all the way to 6ft 7in/201cm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A stubby stem hides the cables, which enter into the top of the headset for a sleek looking front end.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Nukeproof is one of a number of brands that seriously consider the height of the saddle for each bike size, and adjust the geometry to make sure that taller riders don’t have their weight too far back. This can be a problem for taller riders because when you raise the saddle, the effective seat angle decreases.</p>\n<p>Nukeproof calls this the saddle offset, and it impacts on the real seat tube angle. Vitus’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/vitus-escarpe-and-sommet/\">Escarpe and Sommet</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/vitus-e-sommet-emtb/\">e-Sommet</a>, use this approach too.</p>\n<p>The Megawatt’s geometry is, as you’d expect, very up to date, with a long, low and slack front end. The rear triangle doesn’t alter in its sizing between frame sizes, and wheelbases are designed to be very similar to that of the 29er Mega.</p>\n<p>The key geometry figures for a Large are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reach</strong>: 475mm</li>\n<li><strong>Head angle</strong>: 64 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Seat angle</strong>: 78 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle offset (XS/L/XXL)</strong>: 139.98mm / 163.32mm / 194.35mm</li>\n<li><strong>Chainstay length</strong>: 442mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelbase</strong>: 1,288mm</li>\n<li><strong>Bottom bracket height</strong>: 345mm</li>\n</ul><h2>Nukeproof Megawatt suspension details</h2>\n<p>The 170mm of rear wheel travel is provided by a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">four-bar Horst linkage</a>, with a swinglink driving the shock into the top tube.</p>\n<p>The initial axle path is rearward, up until around the sag point, which should help smooth the ride and reduce the amount the wheel hooks up on square edges.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 38mm stanchion forks feature throughout the range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Nukeproof has aimed for a suspension that’s supple at the start, to boost grip and comfort, before offering mid-stroke support.</p>\n<p>At the end of the travel the kinematic’s progressiveness backs off, allowing greater rider adjustment with the air shock’s volume spacers.</p>\n<p>The projected sag range is 30 to 35 per centre, so riders have a reasonably wide range of tuneability to suit their preferences.</p>\n<p>The leverage rate on the shock is said to be very similar to that of the Mega, with a 22 per cent progression through the stroke and an average ratio of 2.6.</p>\n<p>In terms of anti-squat, in the lower gears it’s higher but still sits lower than a non-powered Mega because the motor should make up for that loss of pedal efficiency. This is done to increase suppleness and grip when climbing.</p>\n<p>In higher gears, the anti-squat is fairly low, to reduce the impact of bumps on the cranks – basically reducing pedal kickback – for a smoother ride.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when it comes to anti-rise, there’s some squat under normal braking loads when the suspension is around the mid-travel point, to help the rear tyre dig in, but this tails off on the biggest hits, allowing the rear end to work as it should in all conditions.</p>\n<h2>Nukeproof Megawatt frame details</h2>\n<p>The Megawatt has a number of nice finishing touches.</p>\n<p>These include <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">SRAM’s Universal Derailleur Hanger</a>, room for a 500ml bottle (or 620ml with an adaptor), rubber frame protection boosted by a hard plastic fairing for the motor, a gear accessory mount and a collet style main pivot axle, which Nukeproof says improves frame stiffness.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rubberised protection keeps things quiet.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cable routing is mostly internal, while the seat tube has been designed to allow for the maximum seatpost insertion. There’s tyre clearance for up to 2.6in tyres.</p>\n<h2>Nukeproof Megawatt specifications and prices</h2>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-brake-94e8fff.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Four-pot brakes come on all three models.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-rear-wheel-f1cf36e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>DT Swiss provides the hoops on the top two models.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-derailleur-6330661.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Shimano also supplies the drivetrains.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-cockpit-289980a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Megawatt’s cockpit comes from Nukeproof’s own component line.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Nukeproof-megawatt-tyres-762fb14.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>DoubleDown carcasses and sticky compounds are a nice finishing touch from Nukeproof.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe Nukeproof Megawatt is available in three spec options, with the Comp and Elite heading to stores on the 2 July, and the Factory bikes landing later in the month.\n<h3>Nukeproof Megawatt Comp Alloy</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Battery</strong>: Shimano EP8 with 504Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong>: RockShox Zeb Select 170mm</li>\n<li><strong>Shock</strong>: RockShox Super Deluxe Select</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain</strong>: Shimano Deore</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes</strong>: Shimano Deore</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels</strong>: Sun-Ringle Duroc</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres</strong>: Maxxis Assegai 2.5in WT 3C MaxxGrip DD (f) Maxxis High Roller II 2.5in WT 3C MaxxTerra DD (r)</li>\n<li><strong>Finishing kit</strong>: Nukeproof</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £5,000 / $5,500 / €6,000</li>\n</ul><h3>Nukeproof Megawatt Elite Alloy spec</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Battery</strong>: Shimano EP8 with 630Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Fork: </strong>Fox 38 Performance Elite 170mm</li>\n<li><strong>Shock: </strong>Fox X2 Performance</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain: </strong>Shimano SLX</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes: </strong>Shimano SLX</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>DT Swiss H1900 Spline</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Maxxis Assegai 2.5in WT 3C MaxxGrip DD (f) Maxxis High Roller II 2.5in WT 3C MaxxTerra DD (r)</li>\n<li><strong>Finishing kit: </strong>Nukeproof</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£6,000 / $6,600 / €7,200</li>\n</ul><h3>Nukeproof Megawatt Factory Alloy spec</h3>\n<ul><li><strong>Battery: </strong>Shimano EP8 with 630Wh</li>\n<li><strong>Fork: </strong>Fox 38 Factory 170mm</li>\n<li><strong>Shock: </strong>Fox X2 Factory</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain: </strong>Shimano XT</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes: </strong>Shimano XT</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>DT Swiss H1700 Spline</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Maxxis Assegai 2.5in WT 3C MaxxGrip DD (f) Maxxis High Roller II 2.5in WT 3C MaxxTerra DD (r)</li>\n<li><strong>Finishing kit: </strong>Nukeproof</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£7,000 / $7,500 / €8,200</li>\n</ul>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"893e660a52f1fee7f2f44ea441ad20bb70ecf9a1006522de71effe49ae90a642","category":"Cycling"}
