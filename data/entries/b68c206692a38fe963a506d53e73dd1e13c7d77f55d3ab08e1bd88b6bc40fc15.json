By comparison, the fourth-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the A12Z chip has average single-core and multi-core scores of <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/ios_devices/ipad-pro-12-9-inch-4th-generation\">1,121 and 4,656</a>, respectively, meaning that the M1 iPad Pro is around 56% faster.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Geekbench 5: Average Multi-Core Results</h3><ul><li>M1 MacBook Air: 7,378</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>M1 iPad Pro: 7,284</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Core i9 16\" MacBook Pro: 6,845</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>A12Z iPad Pro: 4,656</li></ul>It's worth noting that the third-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the A12X chip has a higher average multi-core score of 4,809, likely due to statistical variation, but this still results in the M1 iPad Pro being 51% faster, which lines up with Apple's marketing claim that the M1 iPad Pro is up to 50% faster than the previous generation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe benchmark results reveal that the M1 iPad Pro has virtually identical performance as the M1 Macs released last fall. The M1 MacBook Air, for example, has average single-core and multi-core scores of <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-late-2020\">1,701 and 7,378</a>, respectively. Impressively, this means the M1 iPad Pro is faster than a maxed-out 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Intel Core i9 processor, which has average single-core and multi-core scores of <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-16-inch-late-2019\">1,091 and 6,845</a> respectively.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for graphics performance, the M1 iPad Pro currently has an <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=ipad13%2C9\">average Metal score of 20,578</a>, which is up to 71% faster than the previous-generation iPad Pro with the A12Z chip and roughly equal to the graphics performance of M1 Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iPad Pro became available to order starting April 30, with a launch expected on May 21. Reviews of the device are expected to drop next week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/\">benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/11/m1-ipad-pro-benchmarks/\">M1 iPad Pro Over 50% Faster Than Previous Generation in Early Benchmarks</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-ipad-pro-over-50-faster-than-previous-generation-in-early-benchmarks.2295758/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KzFiTLff2QA:Qfib69Xuvgs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KzFiTLff2QA:Qfib69Xuvgs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KzFiTLff2QA\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b68c206692a38fe963a506d53e73dd1e13c7d77f55d3ab08e1bd88b6bc40fc15","category":"Apple"}
