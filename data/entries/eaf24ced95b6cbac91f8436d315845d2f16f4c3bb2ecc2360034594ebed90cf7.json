However, the rate at which SpaceX has begun to reuse its Falcon 9 first stages is decidedly not monotonous.</p>\n\n<p>For Sunday morning's launch, SpaceX used a first stage that had flown into space nine previous times. After this launch, the B1051 booster landed safely on a drone ship, completing its tenth flight to space. This is a notable milestone because, in 2018, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said the goal for its Falcon 9 rocket would be to fly each first stage booster 10 times before requiring significant maintenance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763707#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763707&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eaf24ced95b6cbac91f8436d315845d2f16f4c3bb2ecc2360034594ebed90cf7","category":"Tech"}
