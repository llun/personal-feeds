Each app that asks for permission to track while this setting is toggled off will be treated as if you tapped \"Ask App Not to Track.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a new <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025\">support document</a>, Apple said there are a few circumstances where the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" setting is grayed out, however, including:<ul><li>For users with child accounts or under age 18 by birth year, signed in with their Apple ID</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>If your Apple ID is managed by an educational institution or uses a configuration profile that limits tracking</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>If your Apple ID was created in the last three days</li></ul><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/\"><em>9to5Mac</em> previously reported</a> that some users are still seeing the toggle grayed out even when the first two circumstances listed above do not apply to them, suggesting that there could be a bug or other issue going on. Apple has yet to respond to requests for comment.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome users suspect there might be a correlation between the \"Personalized Ads\" setting and whether \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" is grayed out.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>We dug into this on the iOS Dev Weekly Insiders call last night. It seemed to be a correlation between the \"Personalised Ads\" setting and whether ATT was enabled/disabled by default. <a href=\"https://t.co/5oyagQzj6O\">pic.twitter.com/5oyagQzj6O</a></p>â€” Dave Verwer (@daveverwer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveverwer/status/1387332459860303873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nOn devices with the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" setting grayed out, all apps that request to track are denied permission by default and cannot access the device's random advertising identifier, known as the IDFA, according to Apple. Apps are also not permitted to track your activity using other information that identifies you or your device, such as your email address, although this policy is not enforced at a technical level.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-app-tracking-transparency-video/\">shared a video</a> with more details about its new App Tracking Transparency requirement for those interested in learning more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/allow-apps-to-request-to-track-grayed-out/\">Apple Explains Why 'Allow Apps to Request to Track' May Be Grayed Out on iOS 14.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-allow-apps-to-request-to-track-may-be-grayed-out-on-ios-14-5.2293687/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fDg1eLTjDGU:1QYZIE3hIzw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fDg1eLTjDGU:1QYZIE3hIzw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fDg1eLTjDGU\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fb89a3e5c286c84897d122aa44c64b18d9a16fcf697c9f3e78a3a503242eb60e","category":"Apple"}
