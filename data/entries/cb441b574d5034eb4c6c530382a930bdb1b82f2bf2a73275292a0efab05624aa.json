He was even one of the drivers.

Unlike the other cars in the race, this one was hydrogen-powered. But it didn't use a fuel cell like the Mirai sedan; instead, this car's three-cylinder engine was converted to burn the gas instead of burning gas(oline). The driver line-up for the car showed why. Among the racers listed was a \"Morizo,\" better known to the world as Akio Toyoda, Toyota Motor Company's president.</p>\n<p>No pressure, then.</p>\n<p>\"The reason for competing in a 24-hour endurance race is that simply lasting three or five hours is not enough. You have to have done the preparation to last for 24 hours,\" Toyoda said <a href=\"https://toyotatimes.jp/en/insidetoyota/143.html\">in the weeks before the race</a>. There's no doubt about it—completing a 24-hour race is no easy thing, and the crucible of racing will often reveal problems that engineers don't encounter on the test bench.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769532#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769532&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
