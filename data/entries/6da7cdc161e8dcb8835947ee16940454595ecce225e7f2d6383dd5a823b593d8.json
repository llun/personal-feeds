Although plenty of people have questioned the adjustable, multi-piece handlebar that Canyon uses on that bike, the problems thus far seem to be <a href=\"https://weightweenies.starbike.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=163697&amp;start=2190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">limited to the seatpost</a>, and that handlebar design doesn’t appear to be at fault in the case of Van der Poel&#8217;s broken bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-486599\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-3.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The adjustable width feature on Canyon&#8217;s new Aeroad cockpit may seem very weird (and it is in some ways), but this isn&#8217;t where van der Poel&#8217;s handlebar broke.

However, there were no reports of Van der Poel crashing during the race, and there’s also a visible crimp in the carbon fiber where the lever was once attached.&nbsp;And unusually, if you look closely at the remnants of Van der Poel’s handlebar, you can see that the lever isn’t just flapping about; there appears to be nothing attached to it at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there currently isn’t any visual or video evidence of when the ultimate failure actually occurred, the crimp suggests that Van der Poel’s lever was overtightened to the bar, and at some point — likely when his hands were in the drops — that side of the handlebar snapped in two right at the clamp point. As for the missing pieces, my guess is that they were torn off and discarded along the side of the road somewhere, or were so heavily damaged already that the shards simply fell away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4-1340x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-486600\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4-1340x800.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4-650x388.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4-190x113.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4-1080x645.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Shimano&#8217;s instructions seem pretty clear here, although it&#8217;s certainly possible Canyon obtained explicit approval from Shimano before swapping clamp bands. Either way, the indentation on van der Poel&#8217;s bar seems to match up nicely with the shape of the lever body. Photo: Shimano.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s another potential issue here. Shimano is very specific about the recommended tightening torque for Dura-Ace Di2 levers — 6-8 Nm — and also that the lever should only be used with the stock titanium band clamp. Van der Poel’s lever is clearly fitted with a different clamp band, and given that the bike I recently reviewed was similarly equipped, it seems that this is something Canyon is using at the factory on production Aeroads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could this have been a contributing factor? I, unfortunately, can’t say at the moment given that I don’t know the details on the clamp. I’m still awaiting further information from Canyon, but one would hope that if the company were to go to the trouble of using something other than stock that it’d be to make the installation <em>more </em>safe and secure, not less.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"> <a href=\"https://t.co/0KAeHsWJv2\">pic.twitter.com/0KAeHsWJv2</a></p>&mdash; bart becks (@BartBecks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BartBecks/status/1366799349783625745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 2, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the specific details here, what’s nevertheless clear is that this failure has nothing to do with that adjustable bar width feature that Canyon has incorporated into the new Aeroad, so we can all stop pointing fingers there. What&#8217;s also clear is that Mathieu van der Poel has once again shown himself to be a stellar bike handler given that he didn&#8217;t crash when half his handlebar fell off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s the moral of the story here? Manufacturer recommendations are there for a reason, folks. Heed them — or potentially pay the consequences.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/yep-mathieu-van-der-poels-handlebar-broke-but-its-not-what-you-think/\">Yep, Mathieu van der Poel’s handlebar broke, but it’s not what you think</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6da7cdc161e8dcb8835947ee16940454595ecce225e7f2d6383dd5a823b593d8","category":"Cycling"}
