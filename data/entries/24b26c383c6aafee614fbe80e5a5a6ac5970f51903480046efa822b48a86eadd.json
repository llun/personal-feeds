Everyone loves rewards and benefits on credit cards. But there’s one thing none of us like — interest rates that pile up into debt. Now you can have the best of both worlds with all the points and none of the risk. Point Card gives you unlimited cash back on every purchase and special access to bonus point offers on some of the best brands out there. The whole experience is elevated with Point App which offers concierge-level service in a clean, obsessively-designed, and easy-to-use interface. Everyday spending has never been better.</p>\n\n<p>I mean just take a look at their ad over there in the sidebar: even the cards are obsessively designed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Point Card has a special offer running through May 9: 10× points on all purchases at Apple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/01/point-card\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"24b26c383c6aafee614fbe80e5a5a6ac5970f51903480046efa822b48a86eadd","category":"Tech"}
