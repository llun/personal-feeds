Everyone enjoys rewards and benefits on credit cards. But there’s one thing none of us like — interest rates that pile up into debt. Unlike credit cards, debit cards are like spending cash, but typically don’t come with good rewards.</p>\n\n<p>Now you can have the best of both worlds, with all the points and none of the risk or debt. Point Card is a <em>debit</em> card that gives you unlimited cash back on every purchase and special access to bonus point offers on some of the best brands out there. Buy your next iPhone using Point Card and you’ll get automatic insurance on the purchase, for example. The whole experience is elevated with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/point-debit-card/id1470307568\">Point App</a>, which offers concierge-level service in a clean, obsessively-designed, and easy-to-use interface. Everyday spending has never been better.</p>\n\n<p>I mean just take a look at their ad over there in the sidebar: even the cards are obsessively designed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/30/point-card\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"24b26c383c6aafee614fbe80e5a5a6ac5970f51903480046efa822b48a86eadd","category":"Tech"}
