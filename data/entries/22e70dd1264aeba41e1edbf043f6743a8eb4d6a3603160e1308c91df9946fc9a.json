This represents the longest lead time—the elapsed time between placing an order and receiving products—that the industry has faced since 2017, when the firm began tracking this data.</p>\n<p>Rolland said this lengthened lead time puts the industry in a \"danger zone,\" noting further that \"elevated lead times often compel bad behavior [from] customers, including inventory accumulation, safety stock building, and double ordering.\" In other words, major companies seeking <a href=\"https://www.abbreviations.com/VLSIC\">VLSICs</a> don't behave very differently from consumers seeking toilet paper.</p>\n<p>These shortages impact nearly all industries to some degree, with the heaviest impact falling on industries with long lead times of their own. In particular, the automotive sector is projecting $110 billion in lost sales this year due to factories sitting idle while waiting for components. Again mimicking last year's pandemic-related toilet paper shortages, hoarding tends to make the gaps worse. As the lead times get longer, buyers become more likely to overorder and make supply chain problems worse.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766153#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766153&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"22e70dd1264aeba41e1edbf043f6743a8eb4d6a3603160e1308c91df9946fc9a","category":"Tech"}
