The first collision saw Carr get airborne; the second, in mid air, threw him violently to the ground. The 22-year-old was quickly attended to by medical staff before eventually getting back on his bike. He managed to continue on and finish the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scary crash for Carr. Eurosport NL rightly notices that, especially on these local laps, they should have haybaled that island.

But having seen the crash, I’m pleased to be back on my bike relatively OK.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carr’s crash was cause for consternation among many viewers who criticised race organisers and the UCI for a lack of appropriate protection on the traffic island. Normally the obstacle would have been padded, and/or policed by a traffic marshal who would warn riders of the upcoming danger.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After seeing Simon Carr&#39;s horrible crash today it does make you question the UCI&#39;s priorities. By all means ban the super tuck if really necessary, but what about reviewing dangerous road furniture and other aspects of a course that could cause serious injury. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TirrenoAdriatico?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TirrenoAdriatico</a></p>&mdash; Back in the Saddle (@thewlistt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thewlistt/status/1371563215738568706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Riders needs to shout up too, simple.

Among the new measures were “the enhancement and modernisation of the specifications concerning obstacle protection elements used along the course”. The UCI&#8217;s new measures came in the wake of a series of serious safety incidents during the 2020 season, including <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/12/fabio-jakobsen-tells-the-story-of-his-crash-and-its-aftermath/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fabio Jakobsen&#8217;s devastating crash</a> at the Tour of Poland and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/08/local-driver-gets-on-lombardia-course-crashes-max-schachmann-in-a-corner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Schachmann&#8217;s collision with a private car</a> on the Il Lombardia race route.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carr&#8217;s crash is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK834V7NO48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yoann Offredo&#8217;s spectacular fall at the 2013 Paris-Roubaix</a>, and Peter Stetina&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/news/road/stetina-seriously-injured-in-crash-at-pais-vasco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">near-career-ending crash</a> at the Tour of the Basque Country in 2015. In the latter incident the American collided with an unprotected pole in the roadway, severely injuring his leg.

He was 11th at Strade Bianche and finished eighth on the mountain-top finish to stage 4 of Tirreno-Adriatico, just two days before his crash.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/carr-crash-at-tirreno-adriatico-reignites-safety-concerns/\">Carr crash at Tirreno-Adriatico reignites safety concerns</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"513fac9481d77cf21dd2045577c92e15ca27a9640eb2325698b2e62fdb8ef84f","category":"Cycling"}
