{"title":"New Cervélo R6 Disc spotted?

Roglic finished runner-up to world champion Julian Alaphillipe at the second of the Ardennes Classics, after an uphill sprint on the Mur de Huy.</p>\n<p>Details are scant, and Cervélo has declined to comment beyond the customary “our athletes are an essential part of our development process…”. However, reading between the lines, that statement seems to confirm the brand is testing a new bike.</p>\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CN7lCEolnzb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CN7lCEolnzb/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Team Jumbo-Visma cycling (@jumbovisma_road)</a></p></div></blockquote><h2>Aero front-end</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Roglič attacked on the final climb of the Mur de Huy but was beaten to the line by Julian Alaphilippe.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>It looks to be a fairly minor update. The most obvious change from the pictures we’ve seen comes at the front, with the bike now sporting fully hidden cables, thanks to its use of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/fsa/\">FSA’s</a> ACR (Aerodynamic Cable Routing) headset, stem and handlebar system.</p>\n<p>The ACR system routes the cables, wires and hoses through the headset spacers, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\">headset</a> and a specially designed compression plug (the latter is specifically intended for internally routing the front brake hose through the fork).</p>\n<p>This allows the use of a standard, round steerer tube on the fork, and means the bike is compatible with both fully integrated and non-integrated FSA ACR cockpits. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bianchi-oltre-xr4-ultegra-di2-disc-review/\">Bianchi Oltre XR4</a> and high-end <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-merida-reacto/\">Merida Reacto</a> builds are just two examples of bikes that use this system.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Other than the hidden cables, the bike appears to be visually similar to the current R5 Disc.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Snazzy paint job aside, little else appears to have changed dramatically from the outside.</p>\n<p>Roglic’s new R-series bike appears to carry over a similar blend of lightweight, aerodynamically-optimised tubes (Cervélo calls them ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/all-the-geeky-tech-that-makes-cervelos-new-r-series-cool/\">squoval</a>’), brought together in a relatively classic manner. No dropped seat stays here.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is Cervélo’s current R5 Disc (in Team Jumbo-Visma colours).
