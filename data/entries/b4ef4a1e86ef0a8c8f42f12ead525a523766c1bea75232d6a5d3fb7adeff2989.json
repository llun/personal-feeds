Apple is teaming up with Walgreens Boots Alliance to provide the shots, and employees will be able to sign up on a website that Apple will soon roll out.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/06/apple-park-drone-june-2018-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple in March <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-employees-vaccine-paid-time-off/\">promised time off</a> for employees who need to recover from getting vaccinated, but at the time said that it did not have a way to provide vaccinations. With vaccine availability expanding widely in the United States, Apple is now able to provide additional help to employees who still need the vaccine.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn California, where Apple's main corporate campuses are located, all individuals over the age of 16 have been eligible for a vaccine since April 15. Demand in the Bay Area is high, however, and it can be difficult for individuals living in and around Cupertino to conveniently get vaccinated.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's vaccination program is voluntary, and Apple is offering sick leave for employees who need time to recover from symptoms after receiving the vaccine.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith employees able to be vaccinated, Apple may also be able to get them back in offices sooner, though <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company has not asked employees to return nor has it set a firm date for employees to return after getting vaccinated. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> has, however, told employees that a large number of them will begin returning in June.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in March, Cook said that he \"can't wait\" for employees to return to the office as person-to-person interactions are essential for generating new ideas. \"Innovation isn't always a planned activity,\" Cook said. \"It's bumping into each other over the course of the day and advancing an idea that you just had. And you really need to be together to do that.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/apple-covid-19-vaccine-employee-program/\">Apple Launches Employee Program for COVID-19 Vaccinations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-employee-program-for-covid-19-vaccinations.2292982/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v796RNvn-24:W89_ALKjuaE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v796RNvn-24:W89_ALKjuaE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/v796RNvn-24\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b4ef4a1e86ef0a8c8f42f12ead525a523766c1bea75232d6a5d3fb7adeff2989","category":"Apple"}
