Our goal is to save lives by increasing the number of life-saving donations of blood, platelets, and plasma. While most blood drives are specific to a geographic location, our blood drive is online and worldwide.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/blood_drive_2021.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past 11 years, MacRumors Blood Drives have recorded donations of 827 units of blood, platelets, and plasma, and celebrated new signups for the organ donor and bone marrow registries. We've heard from people whose lives were saved by blood donations from strangers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith a worldwide health crisis, blood donations are more important than ever. Donation centers have taken necessary precautions to protect donors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis year we pay special tribute to user <b>Timelordprime</b>, whose MacRumors Blood Drive totals exceed 130 units of platelets and plasma. He will reach his 400th lifetime blood and platelet donation next month, having donated well over 500 units to strangers in need!\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/featured-donor-2021-450.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>How to participate in the MacRumors Blood Drive - during May 2021</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li><p>If you are an eligible donor, schedule a blood, platelet, or plasma donation (see <a href=\"https://macrumors.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201729417-Blood-and-Platelet-Donation-\">FAQ</a>), at any donation center near you.
