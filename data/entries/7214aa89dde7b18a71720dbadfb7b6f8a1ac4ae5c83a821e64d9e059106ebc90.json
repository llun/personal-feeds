It also brings a number of new features that supplement the powerful parsing engine that makes it easy to manage your contacts and initiate actions such as messages and calls by typing a quick line of text:<ul><li>Relationships: View relationships among your contacts in a family tree view, or even view company org charts that can be automatically generated from Google and Office 365 entries.</li><li>Widgets: With Notification Center and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a>, you can easily set up quick access for frequent contacts by simply specifying a person and an action, and widget setups can sync across your devices.</li><li>Business card scanning: Add contacts by simply scanning a business card with the camera on your ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌. Cardhop will automatically recognize relevant data fields and populate them, and will also save a picture of the business card with the entry.</li><li>Fantastical integration: Invite a single contact or a group of contacts to events via Fantastical.</li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/cardhop-2-ipad-recents.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFantastical made the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/29/fantastical-3-mac-ios-apple-watch/\">shift to a subscription app</a> last year, offering a free tier with limited functionality and a premium tier that unlocks full functionality for the app. Cardhop is now following suit, but with a catch – Fantastical and Cardhop are now bundled together in a single Flexibits Premium subscription at the same price as the previous Fantastical Premium.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/cardhop-2-iphone.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPricing for Flexibits Premium comes in at $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year (a 33% discount compared to monthly), with a 14-day free trial. A family plan for up to five family members is also available, priced at $7.99 per month or $64.99 per year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nExisting Fantastical Premium subscribers will be automatically upgraded to Flexibits Premium to receive access to Cardhop 2.0. Users who previously purchased Cardhop 1 will be able to download Cardhop 2 and continue to use all of the features that were included in Cardhop 1, but will need to subscribe to Flexibits Premium to unlock the new capabilities.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/flexibits/\">Flexibits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cardhop/\">Cardhop</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/cardhop-2-flexibits-premium/\">Flexibits Launches Cardhop 2.0 Contacts Management App, Now Included With Fantastical Premium Subscription</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/flexibits-launches-cardhop-2-0-contacts-management-app-now-included-with-fantastical-premium-subscription.2297745/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2D9NHUzVwbk:h2oVc93LVjg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2D9NHUzVwbk:h2oVc93LVjg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2D9NHUzVwbk\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7214aa89dde7b18a71720dbadfb7b6f8a1ac4ae5c83a821e64d9e059106ebc90","category":"Apple"}
