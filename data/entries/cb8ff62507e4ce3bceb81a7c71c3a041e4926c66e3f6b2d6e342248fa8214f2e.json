The Xbox Game Streaming service has taken <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/28/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-running-on-xbox-series-x/\">an official leap onto all web browsers and iOS devices</a>.</p>\n<p>Should you subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate service, priced <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=ArsXboxCloudUpgrade%7Cxid:fr1624910677201hgd&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass\" target=\"_blank\">at $15/mo</a>, you can now visit <a href=\"http://xbox.com/play\">xbox.com/play</a> on supported web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge) and immediately enter a cloud-gaming instance that resembles the likes of Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, and Nvidia GeForce Now. Connect a controller to your preferred gaming device, then connect to your lowest-latency connection possible, and you'll have access to a library of over 260 games as powered by a Microsoft Azure server instance. (Without a gamepad, many games won't work, though some titles have received Xbox Game Streaming updates to add virtual touchscreen controls should you play on a smartphone.) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/series-x-power-on-your-netbook-xbox-game-streaming-upgrade-is-now-live/\">My most recent article about Game Pass</a> clarifies how its pricing and game selection differ from aforementioned rivals.</p>\n<p>This follows <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/report-xbox-game-streaming-will-land-on-ios-in-2021-using-web-workaround/\">Microsoft's late-2020 promise to get Xbox's cloud service running via an HTML5 interface</a>, which, among other things, would get Xbox Game Streaming to work on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-wont-let-stadia-or-xcloud-into-ios-citing-app-store-guidelines/\">Apple's otherwise restrictive iOS ecosystem</a>. Both Xbox and Stadia faced Apple's smackdown in terms of App Store rules that would require <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/at-trial-epic-and-apple-squeeze-microsoft-over-xbox-xcloud-restrictions/\">every game in their service to receive an individual Apple review and rating process</a>, despite the fact that media-streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ don't receive the same scrutiny for their individual TV series and films. (Without a dedicated Xbox Game Streaming app on iOS, you'll need to create a web shortcut within iOS Safari to add an app-like shortcut to your iPhone or iPad.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776840#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776840&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb8ff62507e4ce3bceb81a7c71c3a041e4926c66e3f6b2d6e342248fa8214f2e","category":"Tech"}
