Polestar is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, so it therefore makes sense that US Polestar production will take place at Volvo's plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina.</p>\n<p>\"Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar's vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an export market but a home market,\" said Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.</p>\n<p>\"Production in the USA reduces delivery times as well as the environmental impact associated with shipping vehicles around the world. It will even have a positive impact on the price of Polestar 3,\" said Polestar COO Dennis Nobelius.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773959#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773959&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
