has launched a new XC race brake, the XCR, based around its X2 caliper and an all-new lever.</p>\n<p>With its factory flat-out making all its other components for an industry struggling to keep up with demand, this lightweight brake will be built in its R&amp;D department in limited quantities – so if you get a pair, you’re unlikely to see many others out and about.</p>\n<ul><li><a

with the rise in popularity of XC, as well as increasingly capable downcountry bikes, saw an opening in the market for a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">lightweight disc brake</a>.</p>\n<p>At the rotor end of things, the brakes use Hope’s X2 caliper, but get lighter-weight aluminium backed pads and a lower profile, as well as a lighter crimped hose connector.</p>\n<p>It’s only available in anodised silver, a departure for a brand known for offering a broad array of colours.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A silver anodised X2 caliper makes its way into the brake-set.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The main changes come at the lever end of the system.</p>\n<p>The main one is the noticeably different form of the lever body, which is actually similar to the Race brake of old, though it has been significantly updated.</p>\n<p>The master cylinder is radially configured, with the piston pushing in towards the bar.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A hinged clamp makes fitting the levers very simple.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Though the orientation of the reservoir is at 90 degrees to other Hope levers, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/hope-tech-3-e4-brake-review/\">such as the Tech 3</a>, it’ll still fit Hope’s Bleed Kit, so bleeding the brake should be just as easy as before.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it still uses a regular olive and barb at the lever end for easy hose shortening.</p>\n<p>Despite its low weight, reach adjustment is still on offer, with both a carbon lever blade and a new hinged split clamp helping to shift some weight.</p>\n<p>Hope has used new pivot bushings on the lever, which it says cuts friction, contributing towards a light lever feel.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A carbon lever blade features on this lightweight
