There are fewer errors in the &#36;6.99 and up sections, but there are still some issues. \"Now You See Me,\" for example, is listed in the &#36;12.99 section, but is priced at &#36;4.99.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple also has pricing errors in other parts of the TV app. In the section \"Family Movie Night\" that's advertising movies under &#36;10 for a limited time, \"Mulan\" is listed, but when you click on it, it's priced at &#36;19.99. The same is true of \"Onward,\" \"The New Mutants,\" and several other movies that are shown in the section.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/tv-app-pricing-error-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1967\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-793129\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nClicking on the \"Family Movie Night\" section sometimes displays a different set of movies than are shown on the main page and sometimes it displays the movies with inaccurate pricing, so it's not quite clear what's going on with the TV app, but Apple definitely has some serious errors to address.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThese errors are persistent across the TV app on multiple platforms, including Mac, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-apps/\">Apple TV apps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/apple-tv-app-misleading-movie-pricing/\">Apple&#039;s TV App Currently Has Misleading Pricing for Movies</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-tv-app-currently-has-misleading-pricing-for-movies.2291079/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PDxxiCtpXRo:txt8lu9p8-4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PDxxiCtpXRo:txt8lu9p8-4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PDxxiCtpXRo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e71b33b3e6d3e8c77eb222233936298cb5ca72655c77418c993c3f5805c31639","category":"Apple"}
