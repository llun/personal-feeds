There were a total of 130 disengagements, up from 64 last year, but that's not a surprise considering the increase in mileage. Apple's cars experienced a disengagement every 144.6 miles, which is a better metric than 2019 where there was a disengagement every 117.8 miles. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll companies that are testing self-driving vehicles in California are required to file annual disengagement reports providing details on how many times a vehicle disengages and gives control back to the safety driver, or the number of times a safety driver in the vehicle takes over.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCompanies must also report total mileage covered by self-driving cars and provide details on any accidents when they occur, but Apple hasn't had a recent accident. The last collision an Apple vehicle experienced <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/uploads/2020/05/Apple_091919.pdf\">was in 2019</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017 using Lexus RX450h SUVs outfitted with a host of sensors and cameras as it works on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> hardware. All of the vehicles are piloted by a pair of drivers at all times even when in autonomous driving mode<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-self-driving-cars-doubled-mileage-2020/\">Apple Self-Driving Test Vehicles Doubled Mileage in 2020</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-self-driving-test-vehicles-doubled-mileage-in-2020.2284022/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BYzNxFo0nwc:zoXcuFdulg8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BYzNxFo0nwc:zoXcuFdulg8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BYzNxFo0nwc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f5b0814c8df6fe229bddac3f70abffb10dbbee519929fa0d593ecc6ed14a683e","category":"Apple"}
