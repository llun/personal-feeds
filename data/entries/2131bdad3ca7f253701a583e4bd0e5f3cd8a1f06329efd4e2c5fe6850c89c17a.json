As demand for cars plummeted, automakers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/global-chip-shortage-worsens-forces-production-cuts-at-gm-hyundai/\">slashed their orders</a>. But at the same time, demand for chips that power laptops and data centers skyrocketed. That bifurcation shifted the market, and when car and truck sales rebounded, semiconductor manufacturers rushed to meet demand. Soon, though, shortages of key components emerged. The industry is known for planning—and for its long lead times—so it could take a while for the chip market to sort itself out.</p>\n<p>“There seems to be a broad consensus that it will stabilize by the end of the year,” Chris Richard, principal in Deloitte’s supply chain and network operations practice, told Ars. “But if I go back to 2008 and the financial crisis, it was a couple years after the rebound started before everything smoothed out again.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754890#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754890&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2131bdad3ca7f253701a583e4bd0e5f3cd8a1f06329efd4e2c5fe6850c89c17a","category":"Tech"}
