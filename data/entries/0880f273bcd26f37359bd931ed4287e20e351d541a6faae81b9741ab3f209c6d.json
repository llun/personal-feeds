Peer inside an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a> algorithm and you’ll find something constructed using data that was curated and labeled by an army of human workers.</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/facebook/\">Facebook</a> has shown how some AI <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/algorithms/\">algorithms</a> can learn to do useful work with far less human help. The company built an algorithm that learned to recognize objects in images with little help from labels.</p>\n<p>The Facebook algorithm, called Seer (for SElf-supERvised), fed on more than a billion images scraped from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/instagram/\">Instagram</a>, deciding for itself which objects look alike. Images with whiskers, fur, and pointy ears, for example, were collected into one pile. Then the algorithm was given a small number of labeled images, including some labeled “cats.” It was then able to recognize images as well as an algorithm trained using thousands of labeled examples of each object.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747769#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747769&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0880f273bcd26f37359bd931ed4287e20e351d541a6faae81b9741ab3f209c6d","category":"Tech"}
