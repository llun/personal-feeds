In February, the company revealed its third battery electric vehicle, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/after-several-suvs-audis-next-electric-car-is-the-handsome-e-tron-gt/\">the e-tron GT</a>, which joins the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/weve-driven-audis-first-proper-electric-car-the-2019-e-tron-suv/\">e-tron</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/audi-adds-a-dash-of-sportback-style-to-its-newest-e-tron-electric-car/\">e-tron Sportback</a> SUVs in dealerships this summer. And following the svelte e-tron GT by year's end is a pair of smaller, more affordable crossovers, called the Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron, unveiled online on Wednesday. (And if that's not enough, we have some news on Audi's other new BEV platform, but we can't tell you about that until next week.)</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, the Q4 fits in between the brand's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-2019-audi-q3-is-a-compelling-crossover-point-of-entry-to-the-brand/\">Q3</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/12/a-sea-of-calm-behind-the-wheel-the-2018-audi-q5-reviewed/\">Q5</a> crossovers. Based on its exterior dimensions, it's only slightly smaller than the Q5, although the benefits of a bespoke BEV platform make for a much more voluminous interior, particularly for those in the back.</p>\n<p>If the Q4 looks somewhat familiar—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/two-days-with-a-volkswagen-id-4-heres-what-we-learned/\">a bit like a Volkswagen ID.4, perhaps</a>—don't be alarmed. That's because it uses a new dedicated BEV architecture shared with VW, called MEB (<em>Modularer E-Antriebs-Baukasten</em> or Modular Electrification Toolkit). Therefore, many of the Q4 e-tron and Q4 Sportback e-tron technical specs may come as no surprise.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756615#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756615&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
