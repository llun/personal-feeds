It’s the quickest I’ve ever braked from 40-0mph.</p>\n<p>My point being, it’s the details that matter in the largely homogenous world of EPS-formed road cycling helmets, and the Rudy Project Venger helmet features what the brand calls a ‘bug net’ designed to prevent insectoid attack, and which adds to the list of reasons this helmet is a decent choice for rides in high summer.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9443/rudy-project-venger-helmet-photos#10\"><p><span>Image 11 of</span> 13</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rudy_project_venger_helmet_11_crop.jpg?itok=898_-nYp\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 11 of </span>13</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Keeping a cool head</h3>\n<p>Besides the handy mesh liner at the front of the Rudy Project Venger helmet, there are several other features that commend it for summer riding. Firstly, there are 22 vents across the helmet, gulping in cooling air at the front and spiriting hot air out the back.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the comfortable padding also does a decent job of absorbing sweat which might otherwise trickle down your brow and sting your eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeinn.com/bike/rudy-project-venger/137326831/p\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Rudy Project Venger now from BikeInn</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>And thirdly, at 240g for a size M, it’s not so heavy that it’s going to feel like you’re carrying a watermelon on your head. It’s not so light that you’d forget you’re wearing it, but for a £130 helmet, it’s respectably low on bulk.</p>\n<p>The one which, in practice, proves troublesome is that you can’t slot your sunnies into the vents – the bug net will get torn by the arms of sunglasses.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9443/rudy-project-venger-helmet-photos#11\"><p><span>Image 12 of</span> 13</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rudy_project_venger_helmet_12_crop.jpg?itok=qlAtmSNG\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 12 of </span>13</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Fit isn’t a fiddle</h3>\n<p>Getting the best fit from the Rudy Project Venger helmet is easy. A simple plastic buckle clips beneath the chin, and the length of the strap is easily adjusted. You’re likely to end up with plenty of excess strap, which can either be doubled back and retained under the rubber loop, or simply snipped to length, pro rider-style.</p>\n<p>The brand’s RSR 10 retention system features a tactile dial which is easily operated on the fly and satisfyingly devoid of wince-inducing clicks in its operation – adjustment is a smooth process.</p>\n<p>What you might find, however, is that the fit comes up a little on the roomy side. Still sporting a lockdown haircut (ie, not having had one for six months), the size M helmet, designed for a 55-59cm head, required almost the full extent of its retention capabilities to remain secure on my 57cm head.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9443/rudy-project-venger-helmet-photos#12\"><p><span>Image 13 of</span> 13</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rudy_project_venger_helmet_13_crop.jpg?itok=JMvOLoDL\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 13 of </span>13</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeinn.com/bike/rudy-project-venger/137326831/p\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Rudy Project Venger now from BikeInn</strong></em></a></p>\n<h3>Got you covered</h3>\n<p>The overall fit of the Rudy Project Venger helmet is certainly one which wraps around the head, rather than perching atop your bonce, which does add to the cosseting feel of this lid. And the area of material around the adjustment dial even feels chunky enough to give the impression of being almost fully enclosed.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8472/thinking-outside-the-box-what-if-there-were-no-uci-rules\">Thinking outside the box: what if there were no UCI rules?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9455/gallery-kasper-asgreen-rips-up-the-script-at-the-tour-of-flanders\">Gallery: Kasper Asgreen rips up the script at the Tour of Flanders</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8984/best-cycling-water-bottles-buyers-guide\">Best cycling water bottles: buyer's guide</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 112: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIn all, it’s a good all-rounder that you suits any kind of ride, and the fact that (at the time of writing) it’s available at £20 off makes it even more appealing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9443/rudy-project-venger-helmet-photos\">Rudy Project Venger helmet photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/marc-abbott\">Marc Abbott</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>1 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9443%2Frudy-project-venger-helmet-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Rudy%20Project%20Venger%20helmet%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9443%2Frudy-project-venger-helmet-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Rudy%20Project%20Venger%20helmet%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9443%2Frudy-project-venger-helmet-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Rudy%20Project%20Venger%20helmet%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9443%2Frudy-project-venger-helmet-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9443/rudy-project-venger-helmet-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 13</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rudy_project_venger_helmet_1.jpg?itok=jVE8WZDl\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/helmets\">Helmets</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0423c92313e3a1ae5d0fcc6f567407184c14ec125e67936b654f1f13ef87bf62","category":"Cycling"}
