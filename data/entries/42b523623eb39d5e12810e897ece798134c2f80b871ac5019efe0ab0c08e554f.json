As of this week, the publisher has <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Cr17TKWQ3XcuNzDw085OLw\">added a facial recognition system, dubbed \"Midnight Patrol,\" to over 60 of its China-specific smartphone games</a>, and it will disable gameplay in popular titles like <em>Honor of Kings</em> if users either decline the facial check or fail it.</p>\n<p>In all affected games, once a gameplay session during <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/asia/china-bans-online-games-minors-intl-hnk/index.html\">the nation's official gaming curfew hours (10 pm to 8 am)</a> exceeds an unspecified amount of time, the game in question will be interrupted by a prompt to scan the player's face. Should an adult fail the test for any reason, Tencent makes its \"too bad, so sad\" attitude clear in its announcement: users can try to play again the next day.</p>\n<p>This week's change doubles down on <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-02-tencent-using-facial-recognition-to-check-users-ages-in-honour-of-kings\">a limited facial-scan system implemented by Tencent in the Chinese version of <em>Honor of Kings</em> in 2018</a>. Since that rollout, we've yet to hear exactly how the system works. Does it determine a user's age based on facial highlights? Does it cross-reference existing facial data—and possibly leverage any of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/how-china-built-facial-recognition-for-people-wearing-masks\">its home nation's public facial-scanning systems</a>? Tencent has not clarified any of Midnight Patrol's technical details.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778664#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778664&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"42b523623eb39d5e12810e897ece798134c2f80b871ac5019efe0ab0c08e554f","category":"Tech"}
