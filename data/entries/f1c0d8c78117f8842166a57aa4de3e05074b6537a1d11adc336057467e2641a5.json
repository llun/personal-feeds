We don’t believe\nthese solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for\nprivacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory\nrestrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term\ninvestment. Instead, our web products will be powered by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/blob/master/proposals/FLoC/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf\">privacy-preserving APIs</a> which prevent individual tracking\nwhile still delivering results for advertisers and publishers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Honestly, I read this post twice and I don’t really know what it means. It sounds good on the surface, but cynically, it also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1367118518592888834\">sounds like an obfuscated way of saying</a> that Google has figured out a way to continue tracking users but doesn’t think that counts as “tracking” because it’s all “first party” on Google properties:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We will continue to support first-party relationships on our ad\nplatforms for partners, in which they have direct connections with\ntheir own customers. And we’ll deepen our support for solutions\nthat build on these direct relationships between consumers and the\nbrands and publishers they engage with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The WSJ is taking Google at its word, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/google-to-stop-selling-ads-based-on-your-specific-web-browsing-11614780021\">with this lede</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google plans to stop selling ads based on individuals’ browsing\nacross multiple websites, a change that could hasten upheaval in\nthe digital advertising industry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Google Claims It Will Replace Tracking With Privacy-Preserving Ads’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/03/google-temkin-ad-tracking\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f1c0d8c78117f8842166a57aa4de3e05074b6537a1d11adc336057467e2641a5","category":"Tech"}
