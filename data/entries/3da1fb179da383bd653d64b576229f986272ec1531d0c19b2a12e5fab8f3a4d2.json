Apple, however, saw a 19% increase in shipments YoY. Apple was the single largest smartwatch maker in Q4 of 2019 when it controlled 34% of the market. In the final quarter of last year, Apple Watch models accounted for 40% of the market share.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/counterpoint-research-q4-2020-watch-shipments.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1506\" height=\"722\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786984\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's market share consolidation can be attributed to the new &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj;'s success, the mid-range Apple Watch option. Apple released the SE model alongside its flagship Series 6 at a lower &#36;279 price point, with some caveats such as the lack of an always-on display, ECG functionality, and the faster S6 processor. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCounterpoint senior analysts Sujeong Lim says that the new mid-range &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; will likely push Samsung and other smartwatch makers to create similar, mid-range options for customers looking for cheaper alternatives to main flagships.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/apple-watch-shipments-q4-2020/\">Apple Held Top Spot in Global Smartwatch Market in Q4 2020, Shipping 13 Million Apple Watch Series 6 and SE Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-held-top-spot-in-global-smartwatch-market-in-q4-2020-shipping-13-million-apple-watch-series-6-and-se-models.2287151/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XZt9Xgoxcys:OWJnJV6pYGQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XZt9Xgoxcys:OWJnJV6pYGQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XZt9Xgoxcys\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3da1fb179da383bd653d64b576229f986272ec1531d0c19b2a12e5fab8f3a4d2","category":"Apple"}
