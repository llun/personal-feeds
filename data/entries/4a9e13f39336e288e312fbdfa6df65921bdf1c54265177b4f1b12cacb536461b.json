With a few hundred meters to go, Niewiadoma attacked, but Van der Breggen was able to keep the gap small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 100 meters to go, Van der Breggen sailed past and held on to claim the win. Niewiadoma settled for runner-up honors two seconds back with Longo Borghini pipping <strong>Annemiek van Vleuten</strong> for third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the full results <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/race-result/?race=255725&amp;stage=result\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3>Alaphilippe nabs his third career victory at La Flèche Wallonne</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Julian Alaphilippe</strong> bested <strong>Primoz Roglic</strong> to win <strong>La Flèche Wallone</strong> for the third time in his career on Wednesday, with <strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> rounding out the podium in third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race came down to the final trip up the Mur de Huy, where Roglic launched a big attack with around 300 meters to go. He initially gained a gap, but Alaphilippe and Valverde followed the move, and Alaphilippe ultimately closed the distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 100 meters to go, Alaphilippe pulled even with Roglic as the climb evened out, and the Alaphilippe pulled ahead, taking the win at the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the full results <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/race-result/?race=255724&amp;stage=result\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3>Valverde keeping his options open</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> has said before that he plans to retire at the end of the year, but he has also hinted at times that he may ride on into 2022, and he did so again on Wednesday. After riding to third at <strong>La Flèche Wallonne</strong> on Wednesday, he noted that this might not be his final tilt at the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t know if that was my last Flèche or if I’ll continue for another year,” Valverde said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Last year, I was saying no, but this year I’ve got great feelings again, so it’s not clear if I’ll stop or carry on.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Moscon wins stage 3 of the Tour of the Alps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gianni Moscon</strong> took his second win so far at this year’s <strong>Tour of the Alps</strong> on Wednesday’s stage 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moscon was part of the early breakaway of the day, and then he and <strong>Felix Grossschartner</strong>, <strong>Michael Storer</strong>, and <strong>Matteo Fabbro</strong> formed a strong lead group of four that got clear on the final climb of the stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That quartet made it to the finale, where Moscon went long in the final kick. Only Grossscharter came close to matching him, but Moscon held on to take the win with Grossscharter settling for second and Storer taking third. <strong>Simon Yates</strong> finished safely in the peloton to retain his overall lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the full results <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/race-result/?race=255728&amp;stage=3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3>Fayetteville 2022 race director steps down</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brook Watts</strong> announced on Wednesday that he had <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/fayetteville-2022-race-director-steps-down/\" target=\"_blank\">stepped down</a> as race director for the 2022 <strong>Cyclocross World Championships</strong>, which are set to take place in Fayetteville, Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arkansas recently passed anti-transgender bills that have led to some calls for boycotts of sporting events in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is with the greatest disappointment that I share with the cyclocross community today that I will no longer be participating as the race organizer of the 2022 Cyclocross World Championships,” Watts said in a statement. “The situation in Arkansas remains problematic and unfortunately, I don’t see any satisfactory solution. I have sincerely but unsuccessfully attempted to work out my concerns and differences with the constituents. However, regrettably, they were not successful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Campagnolo’s new Bora Ultra WTO wheels are made for <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/campagnolo-debuts-new-bora-ultra-wto-flagship-aero-road-racing-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">pure road riding and racing</a>.</li><li>Ronan Mc Laughlin takes a closer look at <strong>Dan Bigham’s</strong> 27 cm <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/new-uci-regs-challenge-accepted-dan-bighams-27-cm-road-handlebars/\" target=\"_blank\">handlebars</a>.</li><li>We found <strong>Kickstarter’s</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/we-found-kickstarters-silliest-bike-campaign-so-you-dont-have-to/\" target=\"_blank\">silliest</a> bike campaign.</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/van-der-breggen-and-alaphilippe-nab-fleche-wallonne-titles-moscon-wins-again-daily-news/\">Van der Breggen and Alaphilippe nab Flèche Wallonne titles, Moscon wins again: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4a9e13f39336e288e312fbdfa6df65921bdf1c54265177b4f1b12cacb536461b","category":"Cycling"}
