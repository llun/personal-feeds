BMW's chairman of the management board, Oliver Zipse, will co-chair this year's conference. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to a description from the state-run outlet <em>Global Times</em>, this year's forum will mark the \"first five-year plan for the country (China) to embark on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country and realize the second centenary goal.\" The conference's overarching theme is \"China on a New Journey Toward Modernization.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis year's conference will be a hybrid of virtual and in-person, although it's unclear in which capacity Cook will attend.
