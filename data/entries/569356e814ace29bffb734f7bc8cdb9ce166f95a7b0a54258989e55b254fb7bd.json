The same will apply to <em>Cruella</em>, the live-action prequel to the Disney animated classic <em>101 Dalmatians</em>, which will get its own theater-and-Disney+ simul-launch on Friday, May 28.</p>\n<p>The announcement, as distributed in a Disney press release on Tuesday, notes that this follows the \"successful release\" of CGI-animated feature <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> both in theaters and on Disney+ on March 5—apparently confirming that the decision made dollars and sense for everyone at Disney, following <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/mulan-skips-us-theaters-will-debut-on-disney-sept-4-for-an-extra-30/\">a similar release strategy</a> for 2020's live-action version of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-sumptuously-reimagined-mulan-turns-disney-princess-into-a-true-warrior/\"><em>Mulan</em></a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751673#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751673&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"569356e814ace29bffb734f7bc8cdb9ce166f95a7b0a54258989e55b254fb7bd","category":"Tech"}
