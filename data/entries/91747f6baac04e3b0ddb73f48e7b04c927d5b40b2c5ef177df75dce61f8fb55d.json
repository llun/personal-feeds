Lobbyists and trade groups representing major tech companies have fought hard against them, with Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/30/apple-right-to-repair-consumer-harm/\">specifically arguing</a> that such laws could lead to device damage or consumers harming themselves when attempting to repair their devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn Washington, for example, Washington House of Representatives Democrat Mia Gregerson sponsored a Right to Repair measure that was fought by Microsoft, Google, Amazon, along with lobbyists representing Apple. \"If you really want to know who was naughty-it was Apple,\" said Gregerson. Lobbyists said Apple would endorse repair programs at local colleges if the bill was dropped.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has opposed bills in other states that include Colorado and Nevada. Independent repair shop owner Justin Millman said that he has a difficult time sourcing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> screens, which are repairs that school kids often need. He claims that Apple opposes repair programs to get people to buy new devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"That's why Apple doesn't answer my emails,\" he said. \"For them, it's just dollars and cents. They don't think about the person on the other side of the ‌iPad‌.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs it fights Right to Repair bills, Apple has attempted to provide alternatives. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-expands-independent-repair-program-worldwide/\">has launched</a> a worldwide Independent Repair Program that's designed to provide repair shops that are not Authorized Apple Service Providers with genuine parts, tools, repair manuals, and diagnostics for performing out-of-warranty repairs on Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe program is free, but repair providers must have an Apple-certified technician perform the repairs, which is a barrier to entry for some shops like Millman's. Even with this program, some parts, like ‌iPad‌ displays, are not provided, leaving Apple and AASPs as the only repair option.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/\">Right to Repair</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/20/apple-right-to-repair-lobbying-efforts/\">Apple's Efforts to Block 'Right to Repair' Laws Highlighted in New Report</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-efforts-to-block-right-to-repair-laws-highlighted-in-new-report.2296944/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8P6N2hK5uhA:st9y9HmdtW8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8P6N2hK5uhA:st9y9HmdtW8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8P6N2hK5uhA\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91747f6baac04e3b0ddb73f48e7b04c927d5b40b2c5ef177df75dce61f8fb55d","category":"Apple"}
