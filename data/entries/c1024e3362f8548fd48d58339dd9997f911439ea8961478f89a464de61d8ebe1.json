There have been rumors of a larger \"&zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; Plus\" version and possible upgrades like a full-front display with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> power button rather than a Home button, but Kuo's latest note suggests the new model won't include many obvious changes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Kuo, the new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will be very similar to the existing model, with the biggest changes being 5G support and an upgraded processor.<blockquote>Apple will release the new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; model in 1H22. The exterior design and most specifications are similar to the existing 4.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;. The biggest change is to support 5G and processor upgrades.</blockquote>The current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; was introduced in April 2020 and is based strongly on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 8 but with some upgraded internals like an A13 chip from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> lineup.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo says that he believes that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user experience will \"significantly improve\" if Apple were to adopt a &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; power button as was previously rumored for the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, but he has \"no visibility on the timing\" for adoption of the feature.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE 2020</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tf-international-securities/\">TF International Securities</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/\">Kuo: Next iPhone SE Coming in Early 2022 With 5G and Processor Upgrades</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-next-iphone-se-coming-in-early-2022-with-5g-and-processor-upgrades.2286659/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9VtKF7Gubh0:yGQoa2NDfl8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9VtKF7Gubh0:yGQoa2NDfl8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9VtKF7Gubh0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c1024e3362f8548fd48d58339dd9997f911439ea8961478f89a464de61d8ebe1","category":"Apple"}
