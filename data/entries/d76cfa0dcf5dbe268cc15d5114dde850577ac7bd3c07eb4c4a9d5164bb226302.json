Other contributors include the industrial and public sectors.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlthough widespread adoption is reliant on network operators, Apple and Google devices are highlighted as the most important drivers in the adoption of eSIM frameworks, accelerating the growth of the technology in the industrial and public sectors. The research paper urges device manufacturers to place more pressure on operators to support eSIM frameworks and accelerate market maturation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has pioneered the commercialization of eSIM technology since the launch of the cellular Apple Watch Series 3. eSIM has since proliferated to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in 2018.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe upcoming iOS 14.5 update is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-enables-5g-in-dual-sim-mode/\">expected to add support</a> for dual 5G-band using the physical SIM as well as the eSIM chip. This functionality was previously only available in mainland China.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\neSIM adoption by more carriers is likely to lead to the eventual removal of the SIM card tray on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and create more internal space, but as shown by the limited support for eSIM on cellular versions of the Apple Watch in some regions, there is still some way to go before the technology has truly widespread use.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/esim/\">eSIM</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-and-google-leading-the-way-on-esim-adoption/\">Apple and Google Leading the Way on eSIM Adoption</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-google-leading-the-way-on-esim-adoption.2289975/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WegPGDxCmlQ:K7Z4vVjYBwA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WegPGDxCmlQ:K7Z4vVjYBwA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/WegPGDxCmlQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d76cfa0dcf5dbe268cc15d5114dde850577ac7bd3c07eb4c4a9d5164bb226302","category":"Apple"}
