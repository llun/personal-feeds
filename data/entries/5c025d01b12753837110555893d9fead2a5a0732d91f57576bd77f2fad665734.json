The Dane has stated that he plans to hunt for stage wins instead of going for the overall. This will be a crucial part of his preparation for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. However, he may be bluffing after a strong ride at the Tour de Suisse. Alexey Lutsenko and Ion Izagirre have both won stages at the Tour de France before and are strong breakaway candidates. They also finished first and second in the time trial at the Criterium du Dauphine, so they'll likely ride well in the ITT stages at the Tour. Alex Aranburu is another Astana rider to watch, he's a </span>well-rounded rider who can sprint capably and get over climbs both long and short.</p>\n<h4><b>Cofidis</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Guillaume Martin</li>\n<li><span>Christophe Laporte</span></li>\n<li><span>Jesús Herrada</span></li>\n<li><span>Anthony Perez</span></li>\n<li><span>Simon Geschke</span></li>\n<li><span>Rubén Fernández</span></li>\n<li>Pierre-Luc Périchon</li>\n<li><span>Jelle Wallays</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Elia Viviani will miss the Tour de France, meaning Christophe Laporte is a good option for Cofidis. This is the Frenchman’s seventh consecutive Tour de France. He has been in the top-5 of a Tour de France stage on eight occasions across that period, but is still looking for his first stage win. Guillaume Martin is Cofidis’ strongest climber, he finished 11th at the Tour last year. He's not a strong time trialist however, so could lose time on stage 5 and 20 meaning he may be best suited to hunting a stage win in the mountains, rather than gunning for the GC. </span>Anthony Perez and Jesús Herrada are two riders that will be ever-present in the breakaway, particularly in the mountain stages. Cofidis haven't won a Tour de France stage since 2008, is this the year they end their drought?</p>\n<h4><b>Trek - Segafredo</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Julien Bernard</li>\n<li><span>Kenny Elissonde</span></li>\n<li><span>Bauke Mollema</span></li>\n<li><span>Vincenzo Nibali</span></li>\n<li><span>Mads Pedersen</span></li>\n<li><span>Toms Skujiņš</span></li>\n<li>Jasper Stuyven</li>\n<li><span>Edward Theuns</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Vincenzo Nibali and Bauke Mollema are Trek-Segafredo’s GC options, we wait to see how their form has progressed after a lacklustre Giro d’Italia. Mads Pedersen is now Trek’s lead sprinter, and almost earned his first Grand Tour stage last year instead, he came in second place twice. Unlike some of the fast-men, Mads can also climb fairly well, so he'll be one to look out for in tough stages where the pure sprinters could struggle. Julien Bernard and Kenny Elissonde are Trek's breakaway stage hunters.</span></p>\n<h4><b>UAE Team Emirates</b></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1316676413_e0859f60-3cf2-4b52-81d6-927f3ab68056_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623491958\" /></p>\n<p><em><span>Image credit: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images</span></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Tadej Pogačar</span></li>\n<li><span>Mikkel Bjerg</span></li>\n<li><span>Rui Costa</span></li>\n<li><span>Davide Formolo</span></li>\n<li><span>Marc Hirschi</span></li>\n<li><span>Rafal Majka</span></li>\n<li><span>Brandon McNulty</span></li>\n<li>\n<p>Vegard Stake Laengen</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The defending champions UAE Team Emirates won the Tour de France in 2020 with Tadej Pogacar, a feat that was accomplished despite Jumbo-Visma owning the front of the peloton throughout and guiding Primoz Roglic into yellow until stage 20. Pogacar was more isolated than his compatriot, but it would be unfair not to note Jan Polanc and David de la Cruz’s fine rides throughout. Both return this year and are joined by UAE's new additions Marc Hirschi and Rafal Majka. Brandon McNulty has also been drafted in to the team after some impressive early season performances, meaning Pogacar has all the help he’ll need.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Qhubeka Assos</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Simon Clarke</span></li>\n<li><span>Michael Gogl</span></li>\n<li><span>Victor Campenaerts</span></li>\n<li><span>Max Walscheid</span></li>\n<li><span>Sean Bennett</span></li>\n<li><span>Nic Dlamini</span></li>\n<li><span>Sergio Henao</span></li>\n<li>Carlos Barbero</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Finally, Giacomo Nizzolo is a winner of a Grand Tour stage. However, Qhubeka Assos enter the Tour without their lead sprinter, so will have to find other ways to win stages. Breakaway and time-trial specialist Victor Campenaerts also won his first Grand Tour stage at the Giro and is present again here. Nic Dlamini will ride his first Tour de France.</span></p>\n<h4><b>BikeExchange</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Luke Durbridge</span></li>\n<li><span>Christopher Juul-Jensen</span></li>\n<li><span>Luka Mezgec</span></li>\n<li><span>Simon Yates</span></li>\n<li><span>Esteban Chaves</span></li>\n<li><span>Michael Matthews</span></li>\n<li>\n<span><span>Amund </span></span>Grøndahl<span> Jansen</span>\n</li>\n<li>Lucas Hamilton</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Simon Yates was on the podium at the Giro d’Italia, but probably won’t ride for the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. Instead, he could be hunting for stage wins. That could leave the GC captain role with 25-year-old Lucas Hamilton, who is inexperienced at Grand Tours but very talented. Esteban Chaves looks back to his best form after he won a stage at the Volta Catalunya in March. Michael Matthews hasn’t won since returning to the Australian outfit, but is one of the best sprinters on hilly terrain.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/under-the-radar-riders-to-watch-at-the-tour-de-france\">Under the Radar riders to watch at the 2021 Tour de France</a></strong></em></p>\n<h4><b>Bahrain - Victorious</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Pello Bilbao</span></li>\n<li><span>Sonny Colbrelli</span></li>\n<li><span>Jack Haig</span></li>\n<li><span>Dylan Teuns</span></li>\n<li><span>Wout Poels</span></li>\n<li><span>Matej Mohorič</span></li>\n<li><span>Marco Haller</span></li>\n<li>Fred Wright</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Bahrain - Victorious displayed their strength in depth when Mikel Landa crashed out of the Giro and Damiano Caruso rose to his new role to claim second in the GC. Neither are present at the Tour de France, but Pello Bilbao, Wout Poels and Jack Haig could all be valid options. Sonny Colbrelli has climbed better than ever this season and is a quick finisher, meaning he could be an outsider for the green jersey. Britain's Fred Wright is an all-rounder, he makes his Tour de France debut.</span></p>\n<h4><b></b></h4>\n<h4><b>AG2R Citroën</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Benoit Cosnefroy</span></li>\n<li><span>Greg Van Avermaet</span></li>\n<li><span>Aurelien Paret-Peintre</span></li>\n<li><span>Ben O'Connor</span></li>\n<li><span>Nans Peters</span></li>\n<li><span>Oliver Naesen</span></li>\n<li><span><span>Michael Schär</span></span></li>\n<li>Dorian Godon</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>AG2R have entered the Tour de France with Romain Bardet as a member of their lineup every year since 2013. This marks the first Tour that the team will be without Bardet, who has now moved to Team DSM. The team are led by classics specialists Greg Van Avermaet and Oliver Naesen, while Nans Peters and Benoit Cosnefroy are great options to chase stages. Their GC man could be Ben O’Connor, he finished sixth overall at the Tour de Romandie after an impressive performance <span>on the Thyon 2000</span>.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Jumbo-Visma</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB1_4872_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623422140\" /></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Wout Van Aert</span></li>\n<li><span>Primož Roglič</span></li>\n<li><span>Mike Teunissen</span></li>\n<li><span>Robert Gesink</span></li>\n<li><span>Jonas Vingegaard</span></li>\n<li><span>Tony Martin</span></li>\n<li><span>Sepp Kuss</span></li>\n<li>Steven Kruijswijk</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The Jumbo-Visma squad are built to try and place Primoz Roglic in the yellow jersey. He had one hand on the <em>maillot jaune</em> last year, but lost the Tour de France in heartbreaking fashion on the stage 20 time-trial. Wout van Aert returns this year after a phenomenal performance at the Tour last season, though he may wish to pursue his own ambitions for the green or even yellow jersey. Sepp Kuss, Steven Kruijswijk and Jonas Vingegaard are the other key mountain domestiques who could all be capable of riding their own GC race for another team.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Movistar</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Alejandro Valverde</span></li>\n<li><span>Carlos Verona</span></li>\n<li><span>Enric Mas</span></li>\n<li><span>Imanol Erviti</span></li>\n<li>Iván García Cortina</li>\n<li><span>Jorge Arcas</span></li>\n<li><span>Marc Soler</span></li>\n<li><span>Miguel Ángel López</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>As always, Movistar have multiple options for the GC. This year, they are led by Enric Mas – who finished fifth at the Tour last year – and Miguel Angel Lopez who is in his first year with the team. Both have displayed strong form in 2021, particularly ‘Superman Lopez’, who won on Mont Ventoux by an incredible two and a half minutes at the Mont Ventoux Dénivelé Challenge recently. Alejandro Valverde continues to defy time, the 41-year-old could hunt stages or play a role in the GC too. Movistar have won the team classification at the previous three editions of the Tour de France.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Bora - Hansgrohe</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Daniel Oss</span></li>\n<li><span>Lukas Pöstlberger</span></li>\n<li><span>Ide Schelling</span></li>\n<li><span>Wilco Kelderman</span></li>\n<li><span>Peter Sagan</span></li>\n<li><span>Nils Politt</span></li>\n<li><span>Emanuel Buchmann</span></li>\n<li>Patrick Konrad</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The German team will be led by Wilco Kelderman, who was third at the Giro d’Italia last year with Team Sunweb. However, after crashing out of the Giro this year, where he was displaying his best form since he was fourth at the Tour in 2019, Emanuel Buchmann could also be a great option. After winning the points jersey at the Giro earlier this year, Peter Sagan starts as one of the favourites to win the green jersey. </span>Ide Schelling is a rider to look out for — the 23-year-old has displayed fine form throughout 2021 thus far, winning the Grosser Preis des Kantons Aargau.</p>\n<h4><b>Ineos Grenadiers</b></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1322102982_695f34f2-8d73-4055-b0bd-38dd815fa84b_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623421872\" /></p>\n<p><em><span>Richard Carapaz, Geraint Thomas and Richie Porte have won WorldTour stage races in the build up to the Tour de France.

For the first time in a while, they are not the very top favourites. However, their strength in depth is undisputed. Geraint Thomas is the most likely to lead them in the GC, the 2018 winner has been on the podium at the previous three stage races he has entered. The team also have three riders that stood on the podium of a Grand Tour last year in Richie Porte, Richard Carapaz and Tao Geoghegan Hart. With Luke Rowe and Michal Kwiatkowski acting as domestiques, they have the team, but will it be enough to claim the top step in Paris?</span></p>\n<h4><b>Lotto Soudal</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1317643402_4d64b82d-40fe-4217-8567-38892ba0fde6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623421478\" /></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Caleb Ewan</span></li>\n<li><span>Jasper de Buyst</span></li>\n<li><span>Tosh van der Sande</span></li>\n<li><span>Thomas De Gendt</span></li>\n<li><span>Roger Kluge</span></li>\n<li><span>Philippe Gilbert</span></li>\n<li>Harry Sweeny</li>\n<li>Brent Van Moer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Without a GC leader, Lotto Soudal are all about stage hunting. The best way can go about this is with one of the best sprinters in the world: Caleb Ewan. The Australian won two stages at the Giro before abandoning ahead of the first rest day. If he’s in a good position, his acceleration can be electrifying. Philippe Gilbert and Thomas De Gendt will try to win stages on more difficult terrain.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Deceuninck - Quick Step</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Julian Alaphilippe</span></li>\n<li><span>Mark Cavendish</span></li>\n<li><span>Kasper Asgreen</span></li>\n<li><span>Davide Ballerini</span></li>\n<li><span>Mattia Cattaneo</span></li>\n<li><span>Tim Declerq</span></li>\n<li>Dries Devenyns</li>\n<li>Michael Mørkøv</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The World Champion Julian Alaphilippe remains Deceuninck - Quick Step’s main attraction despite the plethora of talented riders in their ranks. Alaphilippe has won stages in all four of his previous Grand Tour starts, and is one of the best punchers in the world. Sam Bennett has been ruled out of the Tour de France after injury meaning a fairytale return to the Tour de France for Mark Cavendish. Can the Manx Missile add to his 30 stage victories at the Tour? The winner of the Tour of Flanders Kasper Asgreen is also present. The Dane has an engine that seemingly never runs out of fuel.</span></p>\n<h4><b>EF Education - Nippo</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Sergio Higuita</span></li>\n<li>Rigoberto Urán</li>\n<li><span>Magnus Cort</span></li>\n<li><span>Neilson Powless</span></li>\n<li><span>Stefan Bissegger</span></li>\n<li><span>Michel Valgren</span></li>\n<li><span>Ruben Guerreiro</span></li>\n<li>Jonas Rutsch</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Rigoberto Uran finishes in the top ten of Grand Tours for fun, but hasn’t got close to winning one since he was second at the Tour de France in 2017. The Colombian cannot be counted out, particularly after he was second at the Tour de Suisse. Magnus Cort is a fast finisher but can climb well too, meaning he’s a great candidate from the breakaway or in medium mountain stages with flat finishes.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Groupama - FDJ</b></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1317820995_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623421955\" /></p>\n<p><em><span>Attila Valter of Groupama - FDJ in the pink jersey at the Giro d'Italia (Image credit: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)</span></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Bruno Armirail</span></li>\n<li>Arnaud Démare</li>\n<li><span>David Gaudu</span></li>\n<li><span>Jacopo Guarnieri</span></li>\n<li><span>Ignatas Konovalovas</span></li>\n<li>Stefan Küng</li>\n<li>Valentin Madouas</li>\n<li>Miles Scotson</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Thibaut Pinot has only missed one edition of the Tour de France since 2012. His name missing from the 2021 startlist is the most notable observation from Groupama - FDJ's team. Will David Gaudu be able to fill Pinot’s shoes? All the signs suggest he can — he has already won multiple times this season including on the queen stage of the Itzulia Basque Country Tour. Gaudu will lose a lot in the time trials which makes him less dangerous in the GC, but the young Frenchman is quickly becoming one of the best climbers in the peloton. Sprinter Arnaud Demare also returns to the Tour after cleaning up at the Giro d’Italia last year.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Intermarché - Wanty - Gobert Matériaux</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Jan Bakelants</span></li>\n<li><span>Jonas Koch</span></li>\n<li><span>Louis Meintjes</span></li>\n<li><span>Loic Vliegen</span></li>\n<li><span>Danny van Poppel</span></li>\n<li><span>Boy Van Poppel</span></li>\n<li><span>George Zimmerman</span></li>\n<li>Lorenzo Rota</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Taco van der Hoorn’s victory at the Giro d’Italia earlier this year was, for many, one of the moments of the race. At the Tour, Intermarché must rely on the breakaway to hunt stages with the likes of Loic Vliegen and Aime De Gendt. Louis Meintjes also returns to the Tour for the first time since he finished eighth in 2017, though he hasn’t shown similar form since.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Israel - Start Up Nation</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Guillaume Boivin</span></li>\n<li><span>Chris Froome</span></li>\n<li><span>Reto Hollenstein</span></li>\n<li><span>Omer Goldstein</span></li>\n<li><span>Andre Greipel</span></li>\n<li><span>Rick Zabel</span></li>\n<li>Dan Martin</li>\n<li>Michael Woods</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Chris Froome joined Israel - Start Up for one of the biggest transfers of the 2021 season. He has progressed since getting back on his bike following the horrific crash he suffered at the 2019 Dauphine, but is nowhere near his previous level. Froome will start the Tour, but Mike Woods is Israel’s leader — the Canadian has displayed sublime form throughout 2021 thus far and is climbing better than ever before. Dan Martin also starts after completing the trilogy of Grand Tour stage victories earlier this year at the Giro.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Team DSM</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Tiesj Benoot</span></li>\n<li>Søren Kragh Andersen</li>\n<li><span>Cees Bol</span></li>\n<li><span>Mark Donovan</span></li>\n<li><span>Nils Eekhoff</span></li>\n<li>\n<span><span>Joris </span></span>Nieuwenhuis</li>\n<li>Casper Pedersen</li>\n<li>Jasha Sütterlin</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Team DSM enter with a strong sprint train which was on display last year, but didn’t culminate in a Cees Bol stage win. The Dutch sprinter is big and powerful, and will hope to win his first Grand Tour stage this season. Nils Eekhoff can also sprint capably, but will likely be used <span>predominantly </span>as a lead out man. Søren Kragh Andersen won two stages at last year’s race and returns for his fourth Tour de France this year. The Dane is always one to watch from the breakaway and in time trials.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Alpecin - Fenix</b></h4>\n<p><span><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/UAE-Tour-2021-206-_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623421752\" /></em></span></p>\n<p><span><em>Mathieu van der Poel taking a stage win at the UAE Tour (Photo</em></span><em><span> credit: LB/RB/CorVos)</span></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Kristian Sbaragli</span></li>\n<li>Petr Vakoč</li>\n<li><span>Tim Merlier</span></li>\n<li><span>Xandro Meurrise</span></li>\n<li><span>Mathieu van der Poel</span></li>\n<li><span>Silvan Dillier</span></li>\n<li>Jasper Philipsen</li>\n<li>Jonas Rickaert</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Now aged 26, Mathieu van der Poel will embark on his first Grand Tour at the 2021 Tour de France. The Dutch star could perhaps challenge for the green jersey, but his ambitions at the Olympic games may put paid to that. That said, he’ll be one of the favourites to win multiple stages. The team also bring both Tim Merlier and Jasper Philipsen, who have both won Grand Tour stages in the last 12 months. Merlier, Van der Poel and Philipsen are all capable of sprinting in mass groups themselves, though it looks like Merlier is their primary sprinting option.</span></p>\n<h4>\n<b>Team TotalEnergies</b><b><br /></b>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Pierre Latour</span></li>\n<li><span>Anthony Turgis</span></li>\n<li><span>Victor de la Parte</span></li>\n<li><span>Cristian Rodriguez</span></li>\n<li><span>Edvald Boassen Hagen</span></li>\n<li><span>Julien Simon</span></li>\n<li>Fabien Doubey</li>\n<li>Jeremy Cabot</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The French outfit have recently announced a name change from </span>Total Direct Energie to Team TotalEnergies. <span>A team of stage hunters.

Quintana has never won the Tour de France in seven attempts, though he has been on the final podium three times and still hopes to become the eighth man to win all three of cycling’s Grand Tours. Warren Barguil is looking more dangerous on hilly terrain as his career progresses, whilst Nacer Bouhanni will sprint for Arkéa.</span></p>\n<h4><b>B&amp;B Hotels</b></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Pierre Rolland</span></li>\n<li><span>Quentin Pacher</span></li>\n<li><span>Maxime Chavalier</span></li>\n<li><span>Franck Bonnamour</span></li>\n<li><span>Cyril Barthe</span></li>\n<li><span>Cyril Gautier</span></li>\n<li>Cyril Lemoine</li>\n<li>Bryan Coquard</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Bryan Coquard has been second and third in stages at the Tour de France on numerous occasions in his career, including a stage to Limoges where he was beaten by Marcel Kittel in a photo finish.
