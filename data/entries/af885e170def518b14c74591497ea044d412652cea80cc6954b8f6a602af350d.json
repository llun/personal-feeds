Neither of those price points includes an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> or a Magic Keyboard, both of which can be purchased separately.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's new ‌iPad Pro‌ models will be available for order on April 30 and will ship out in May.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/m1-ipad-pro-maxed-out-cost/\">Maxed Out M1 12.9-Inch iPad Pro With 5G, 16GB RAM, and 2TB Storage Costs $2,400</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/maxed-out-m1-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-with-5g-16gb-ram-and-2tb-storage-costs-2-400.2292383/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3UEZm0HCQOg:n9xl6m-Jwa0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3UEZm0HCQOg:n9xl6m-Jwa0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3UEZm0HCQOg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"af885e170def518b14c74591497ea044d412652cea80cc6954b8f6a602af350d","category":"Apple"}
