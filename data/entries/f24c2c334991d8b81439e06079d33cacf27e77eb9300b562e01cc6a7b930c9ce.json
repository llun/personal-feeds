With compatible TVs, users will find a new toggle under \"TV &amp; display options\" in their Xbox settings tab to enable Dolby Vision. Additionally, not all ‌Apple TV‌ content will initially support Dolby Vision. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>To start experiencing it with a Dolby Vision compatible TV, you need to have “Allow Dolby Vision” enabled and checked in Settings &gt; General &gt; TV &amp; display options &gt; Video Modes on your console. You can also confirm if content is available in Dolby Vision by looking for the Dolby Vision logo at the bottom of the Movie / Show’s description page in the ‌Apple TV‌ app or during playback by pressing the B button on your controller.</blockquote>The ‌Apple TV‌ app, which previously only lived on Apple devices, has gradually been making its way to other devices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/22/apple-tv-app-coming-to-ps4-and-ps5/\">such as the PS4</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/21/samsung-terrace-apple-tv-airplay-2/\">select smart TVs</a>.
