Other custom configurations are available too, but stock typically fluctuates rapidly on Apple's refurbished store, so those interested should act fast to place their order.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple began selling <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/refurbished-m1-13-inch-macbook-pro/\">refurbished 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-selling-refurbished-m1-macbook-air/\">MacBook Air models</a> with the M1 chip in select countries earlier this week.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's refurbished products are pre-owned devices that are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and in the case of the Mac mini, repackaged with the power cord in the box. In our view, a refurbished Mac mini is virtually indistinguishable from a brand new model, so this represents a good opportunity for savings. However, keep in mind that third-party resellers may offer better deals over time, so be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">monitor our deals roundup</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's refurbished Macs are covered by a one-year limited warranty and have a 14-day return policy. AppleCare+ coverage can be purchased as well.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanwgregg\">Ryan Gregg</a>!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/refurbished/\">refurbished</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/refurbished-m1-mac-mini/\">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished M1 Mac Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-m1-mac-mini.2286256/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zVSgbhr_9ac:fHu5M91y-qs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zVSgbhr_9ac:fHu5M91y-qs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zVSgbhr_9ac\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"728b6d6fdea8d1a85d02451f83b64d9278c4294b3950c64c8029d42340e37bbc","category":"Apple"}
