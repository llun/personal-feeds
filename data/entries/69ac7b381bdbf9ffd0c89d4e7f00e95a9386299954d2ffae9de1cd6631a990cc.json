The regular AirPods with Wired Charging Case are down to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$119.00</strong></a>, down from $159.00. This model was at $99.99 earlier in the morning, proving how fast Prime Day deals can disappear.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$40 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for $119.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe AirPods with Wireless Charging Case is priced at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$149.99</strong></a>, down from $199.00.
