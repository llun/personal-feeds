According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/29/ios-15-and-macos-12-naming-mentions/&amp;xcust=1-1-342024-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/29/ios-15-and-macos-12-naming-mentions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebKit code spotted by 9to5Mac</a>, the next version of macOS won&rsquo;t be 11.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn&rsquo;t make a big deal out of finally moving from <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234324/macos-big-sur-faq.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234324/macos-big-sur-faq.html\">macOS X to 11 with Big Sur</a>, and with the launch of the first Apple silicon Macs, it made sense to start fresh. But we also assumed Apple would follow the same numbering system that it did with OS X, meaning this year&rsquo;s release would be macOS 11.1 and likely be named for a place within Big Sur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to 9to5Mac, however, mentions of iOS 15 and macOS 12 were recently added to the open-source WebKit repository by an Apple employee, strongly suggesting those are the names Apple will use in the fall when new versions arrive. 9to5Mac notes that WebKit code usually labels future version of operation systems &ldquo;TBA&rdquo; to hide version numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil the next version of macOS and iOS at its annual WWDC conference during an online keynote on June 7.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"New Apple releases for April 2021","siteHash":"96818feac4967635d7bee720d265a5c7b00a28fbea60825c58ad56fa3c4aaefa","entryHash":"1290452794c8b3f804a8c87c59a09cfca2d5811aee01bcfb6d89aa1f8d210fd9","category":"Apple"}
