The internet ran rampant with disproven rumours about Canyon’s adjustable-width handlebar design, while our own Global Tech Editor, James Huang, suggested the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/yep-mathieu-van-der-poels-handlebar-broke-but-its-not-what-you-think/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">break was likely caused by too much clamping force</a> at the brake lever assembly clamp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Canyon is asking owners of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/2021-canyon-aeroad-coddles-you-with-speed-stiffness-and-comfort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new Aeroad CF SLX and CFR</a> (equipped with Canyon’s CP00018 and CP00015 handlebars) to stop riding their bikes until the company’s investigation is complete. Owners of the lower-cost Aeroad CF SL are not impacted by this safety alert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Mathieu, fortunately, did not fall,” said founder of Canyon Bicycles, Roman Arnold, in a press release from the German consumer-direct company.&nbsp;&#8220;We want to ensure with absolute certainty that no one comes to harm before we have fully understood the root cause.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2-1340x893.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-486596\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2-1340x893.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2-650x433.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2-1080x720.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-broken-Canyon-Aeroad-handlebar-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The public cause of this stop-riding notice. Mathieu van der Poel still managed to lead out the sprint with his bike in this condition. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With immediate effect, Canyon will be swapping all of its sponsored professional teams to alternative bikes, including the previous model of the Aeroad or the current Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are doing everything we can to equip the affected Aeroad models as quickly as possible with a cockpit that meets both our and our customers&#8217; demands for total quality and safety,” said&nbsp;Canyon&#8217;s CEO, Armin Landgraf. It&#8217;s a message that suggests Canyon may be heading toward a product recall rather than simply releasing a reminder that recommended torque figures matter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course this is bad news for those with a shiny new Aeroad CF SLX or Aeroad CFR, and the company hasn’t given a timeline for how long the bikes will be sidelined. This is one we’ll be following closely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/canyon-asks-new-aeroad-owners-to-stop-riding-bike-following-broken-handlebar/\">Canyon asks new Aeroad owners to stop riding bike after MvdP’s broken handlebar</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b0f81ff210d257a6b7ce6c43dbf6c17a9bcc55006f84ddf540b8e22a88d6c2cd","category":"Cycling"}
