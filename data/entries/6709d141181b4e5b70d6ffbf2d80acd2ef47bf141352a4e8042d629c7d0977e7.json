But this comprehensive look at the world of 1,182 unique emoji (and counting) first sneaked onto our radar during <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/ars-at-sxsw-2019/\">South by Southwest 2019</a>. Emoji activist and dumpling emoji (<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f95f.png\" alt=\"ü•ü\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\">) creator Jennifer 8. Lee was presenting on the newly adopted \"interracial couple\" emoji (which she helped shepherd to reality alongside partners at Tinder) and mentioned she had produced an upcoming project. Lee's panel essentially demystified the unseen emoji creation and approval process for a small Austin Convention Center conference room, and her film would set out to do the same for a much wider audience.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of a maze and takes a really long time‚Äîgenerally between 18-24 months‚Äîfrom when you have an idea and when it hits your iPhone,‚Äù Lee said during that SXSW panel. She would know. In addition to her successful dumpling campaign, Lee is one of the leaders of <a href=\"http://www.emojination.org\">EmojiNation</a>, a group that set out to diversify emoji after learning firsthand how limited the selection process can be. After all, the emoji that now run rampant on our smart devices and social media feeds all get approved by the tiniest, 12-person selection committee made up of older techie representatives from big corporations (Netflix, Google, Oracle, IBM, Apple, Facebook, Adobe, Microsoft, Shopify) alongside a few unexpected guests (German software company SAP; the Chinese telecom company Huawei; and the government of Oman). Each organization pays tens of thousands a year for the privilege of having someone voting yes or no on everything from \"mate\" (a customary Argentine drink) to \"anglefish.\" Lee eventually joined the Unicode sub-committee on emoji (a non-voting role open to anyone with a <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/consortium/joinform.html\">$75/year Unicode membership</a>) to better learn the emoji vetting process and look through submissions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753943#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753943&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6709d141181b4e5b70d6ffbf2d80acd2ef47bf141352a4e8042d629c7d0977e7","category":"Tech"}
