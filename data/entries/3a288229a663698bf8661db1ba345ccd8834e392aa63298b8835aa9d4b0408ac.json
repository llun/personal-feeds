It says that this version should have an EPA range of 240 miles (386 km). That should increase if you option it with the Plus Pack, which adds a slightly nicer interior (using the WeaveTech fabric from the Launch Edition), more speakers for the sound system, heated rear seats, steering wheel, and wiper blades, but perhaps most importantly, a heat pump.</p>\n<p>The addition of a heat pump means that the Polestar 2 can warm or cool the cabin with less draw from the 78 kWh battery pack, and Polestar says that at ambient temperatures between 40-60˚F (4.4-15.5˚C) it can add up to 10 percent to the car's range.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756542#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756542&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
