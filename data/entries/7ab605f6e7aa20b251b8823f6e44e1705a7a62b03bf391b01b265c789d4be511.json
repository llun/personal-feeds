{"title":"Amazon Devices Will Soon Default to Sharing Your Wi-Fi With Other Nearby Amazon Devices","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/amazon-devices-will-soon-automatically-share-your-internet-with-neighbors/","date":1622584564000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Goodin, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On June 8, the merchant, Web host, and entertainment behemoth will\nautomatically enroll the devices in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b?node=21328123011\">Amazon Sidewalk</a>. The new\nwireless mesh service will share a small slice of your Internet\nbandwidth with nearby neighbors who don’t have connectivity and\nhelp you to their bandwidth when you don’t have a connection.</p>\n\n<p>By default, Amazon devices including Alexa, Echo, Ring, security\ncams, outdoor lights, motion sensors, and Tile trackers will\nenroll in the system. And since only a tiny fraction of people\ntake the time to change default settings, that means millions of\npeople will be co-opted into the program whether they know\nanything about it or not. The Amazon webpage linked above says\nSidewalk “is currently only available in the US.” […]</p>\n\n<p>Amazon has published a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GRGWE27XHZPRPBGX\">white paper</a> detailing the technical\nunderpinnings and service terms that it says will protect the\nprivacy and security of this bold undertaking. To be fair, the\npaper is fairly comprehensive, and so far no one has pointed out\nspecific flaws that undermine the encryption or other safeguards\nbeing put in place. But there are enough theoretical risks to give\nusers pause.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The instructions for opting out are easy, but this seems like something that ought to be opt-in, not opt-out. (My only Amazon device that’s plugged in is a first-generation Echo, which is too old for Sidewalk, so I don’t even see the preference setting in the Alexa app. Apparently the setting only appears if you have at least one eligible device — you can’t opt-out in advance.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/01/amazon-sidewalk-privacy\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7ab605f6e7aa20b251b8823f6e44e1705a7a62b03bf391b01b265c789d4be511","category":"Tech"}
