Which is where the Nfinity comes in.</p>\n<p>It’s a platform that you put your bike and turbo trainer on, allowing the whole setup to move in a way that feels like riding on the road for real.</p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-widget-wrapper\">\n<p data-type=\"in-text\" data-config='{\"nameKeywords\": \"Saris H3 smart\"}' data-template=\"ygkbfxqzpb\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>Conceptually this is nothing new – Kinetic has long since had the Rock and Roll turbo that moves side-to-side – but what makes the Nfinity unique is its 360° ‘multi-dimensional’ movement.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/tutorials/4356/how-to-maintain-your-bike-in-the-snow\">How to maintain your bike in the snow</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/4416/best-commuter-bikes\">The best commuter bikes 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9168/cycle-lane-removal-disproportionately-affects-young-people-charity-warns\">Cycle lane removal disproportionately affects young people, charity warns</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/9163/cycling-uk-led-by-women-for-first-time-in-143-year-history\">Cycling UK led by women for first time in 143 year history</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8818/king-alfreds-way-cycling-uk-route-bikepacking-touring\">King Alfred&#039;s Way: Conquering Wessex during Britain&#039;s wettest ever day</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nUsing a series of rollers and bowed tracks, the Nfinity can shift 24cm fore-aft and tilt 12° to either side. This, says Saris, not only makes riding feel more natural, but aids performance by engaging the core and upper body as well as the legs.</p>\n<p>Encouraging shifts in weight also alleviates that dead backside feeling that comes from hours sat in a rigid turbo position.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dennismags.co.uk/cyclist\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/clickable_subs_promo.jpg\" alt=\"click to subscribe\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Nfinity is designed with the H3 turbo trainer in mind, but Saris says the platform will work equally well with most other trainers and the company provides a guide for how to secure each model to the solid birchwood base using straps that fit in special grooves in the platform.</p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-widget-wrapper\">\n<p data-type=\"in-text\" data-config='{\"nameKeywords\": \"Saris MP1 Nfinity\"}' data-template=\"ygkbfxqzpb\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>At a pound shy of a grand, the Nfinity is more expensive than most turbos, but if money is no problem then it will add a new dimension to your indoor training. </p>\n  </div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"5ff54cf3ce9e93e97d495158e538a3416cb2012446eb43852adb0277493e3985","category":"Cycling"}
