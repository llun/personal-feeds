{"title":"Apple Fixes iCloud Links for Sharing Shortcuts","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/apple-fixes-icloud-shortcut-links/","date":1616701893000,"content":"There was a major issue with Shortcuts earlier this week, which prevented all Shortcut links shared through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> to stop working properly. Apple has now fixed the problem, and links to Shortcuts on the web should be largely functional again.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/shortcut-not-found-better.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-790916\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Shortcut issue affected links to shared shortcuts that were created prior to the last couple of weeks. When attempting to download a Shortcut from one of these links, there was an error about the shortcut link being invalid.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis impacted many websites that share various Shortcuts, such as <em><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/\">MacStories</a></em>, which houses a repository of useful shortcuts created by Federico Viticci. Last night, Apple told Viticci it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1374925965239914496\">working on a fix</a> to restore the broken shortcuts.<blockquote>We are aware of an issue where previously shared shortcuts are currently unavailable. Newly shared shortcuts are available, and we are working to restore previously shared shortcuts as quickly as possible.</blockquote>As of this morning, Viticci said that many of the <em>MacStories</em> shortcuts are once again functional, and we can confirm that most of the Shortcut links we tested from <em>MacStories</em>, <a href=\"https://routinehub.co\">RoutineHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/\">Reddit</a> are working.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Apple has begun restoring links to old shortcuts.
