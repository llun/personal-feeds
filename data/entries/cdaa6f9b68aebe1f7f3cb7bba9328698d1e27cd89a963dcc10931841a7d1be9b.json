These updates brought about improved performance, better battery life, and more. There's also a 256GB model, but we aren't seeing any notable discounts this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5M9XBS?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$100 OFF</div>M1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,149.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can find the best monthly deals on all new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air notebooks in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-air-deals/\">new \"Best Deals\" guide</a>.
