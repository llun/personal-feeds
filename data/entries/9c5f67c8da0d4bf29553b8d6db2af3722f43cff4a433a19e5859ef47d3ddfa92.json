Updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, a new low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, refreshed iMacs, and the long-awaited <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> are all products that Apple could potentially introduce.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that we're waiting on so many ‌iPad‌ refreshes, iPads could be the focus of the April event. Apple is rumored to be working on a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">high-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> that will feature a mini-LED display and a 5G chip, and there's an 11-inch model coming too. These iPads are expected to feature Thunderbolt connectivity, camera improvements, and a new A14X chip that's as fast as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/iPad-pro-top-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA sketchy rumor said Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">will debut</a> an \"‌iPad mini‌ Pro\" with an 8.7-inch full-screen display and no <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> Home button. There have also been rumors of an ‌iPad mini‌ with a mini-LED display, but it's not clear just what ‌iPad mini‌ upgrades we'll get, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/leaked-ipad-pro-triple-cameras-ipad-mini/\">recent dummy model photos</a> have suggested there could be few obvious differences from the current model. We could also see a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">low-cost iPad</a> with a 10.2-inch display and a thinner build that's similar to the now-discontinued <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> 3.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/iPad-mini-pro-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/#the_future_of_airpods_and_apple_headphones\">the AirPods 3</a>, Apple is working on a new version that looks similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> with silicone ear tips and shorter stems, but without the high-end Active Noise Cancellation functionality. There were rumors that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3 would be coming at the spring event, but we're no longer expecting them until the fall. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/AirPods-Gen-3-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple is designing a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">revamped iMac</a> with a new design that features thinner bezels that are similar to the bezels on the Pro Display XDR, plus it will have an Apple silicon chip and an Apple-designed GPU, making it a highly-anticipated machine. We don't know when new iMacs are coming, but an April event is a possibility. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/flat-imac-3d-3-teal.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe're <em>still</em> waiting on ‌AirTags‌, which are Apple's Tile-like Bluetooth tracking tags that will be able to be attached to any item, allowing that item to be tracked right in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> app alongside Apple devices. Apple just last week expanded its ‌Find My‌ network to include third-party devices such as an upcoming item tracker from Chipolo, so next week's event could finally see the ‌AirTags‌ unveiled as Apple's similar product offering.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/airtags-mockup-4-blue-text.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also a sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> in the works with an upgraded processor and a new ‌Apple TV‌ remote with ‌Find My‌ integration, but it's not clear if the ‌Apple TV‌ will be coming at the April event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple plans to stream the‌ event live on its website and in the ‌Apple TV‌ app when it kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on April 20.
