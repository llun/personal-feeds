The Reddit user says they placed their order when pre-orders initially went live and that the retail chain informed them that their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> was ready for pick-up, despite not yet having been officially launched from Apple. Apple says the new ‌iPad Pro‌ and ‌M1‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> will be available starting in the second half of May, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-shipping-may-21/\">most likely May 21</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOfficial reviews of the M1-powered ‌iPad Pro‌ have yet to be published, leaving many to ask the customer for first impressions and thoughts.
