The result doesn't look very cosmetically appealing, but smythey said the AirTag seems to function normally after the do-it-yourself job.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA teardown of the AirTag shared on YouTube today provides a first look inside Apple's item tracker, revealing a circular circuit board with seemingly just enough room around the edges to drill a small hole in the plastic.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nKeep in mind that drilling a hole into an AirTag will unsurprisingly void Apple's warranty and could damage the accessory if done incorrectly, but this still proves as a neat proof of concept for those looking to save a few dollars.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIs your AirTag order arriving today? <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232/\">Discuss with others in our AirTag forum</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/its-possible-to-drill-a-hole-through-an-airtag/\">It's Possible to Drill a Hole Through an AirTag</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/its-possible-to-drill-a-hole-through-an-airtag.2294118/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XxMfiuvCbrE:ZNK3rZqYLf0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XxMfiuvCbrE:ZNK3rZqYLf0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XxMfiuvCbrE\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07e3f843bb41e81d95aee705b65c4d3baf401f19aca5b169c707923c182cb51b","category":"Apple"}
