Let’s discuss them one by one.</p>\n<p>First up, the Great Suspender, an extension with more than 2 million downloads from the Chrome Web Store, has been pulled from Google servers and deleted from users’ computers. The extension has been an almost essential tool for users with small amounts of RAM on their devices. Since Chrome tabs are known to consume large amounts of memory, the Great Suspender temporarily suspends tabs that haven’t been opened recently. That allows Chrome to run smoothly on systems with modest resources.</p>\n<h2>Characteristically terse</h2>\n<p>Google's official reason for the removal is characteristically terse. Messages displayed on devices that had the extension installed say only, “This extension contains malware” along with an indication that it has been removed. A Google spokesman declined to elaborate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740160#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740160&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5208b56a49e4f4fd94293b55d008d4edbf37cc27a59ae1eb2ca9487c5dac554","category":"Tech"}
