Monitoring them can involve detecting surface changes and small earthquakes caused by the movement of magma inside a volcano, or measuring changes in gases emitted from vents. Signs like these are used to raise alerts and trigger evacuations, and they have saved lives. But they aren’t always perfect.</p>\n<p>Japan’s Mount Ontake <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Mount_Ontake_eruption\">erupted in 2014</a> without warning, for example, killing more than 60 people. So additional methods for detecting volcanic activity are always welcome, especially if they involve subtler signs that could be overlooked. A new study from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory group led by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GironaTarsilo\">Társilo Girona</a> highlights the possibility that presently available satellite data could provide an entirely new way to warn of eruptions.</p>\n<p>Heat is obviously a relevant parameter for volcanic activity, but it can be quite variable at the individual spots where you might set up a thermometer. If we could instead measure all the heat coming out of a volcano, it would be quite meaningful, since the majority of volcanic energy gets released as heat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749574#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749574&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scott K.
