Tapping the icon (which looks like Apple's Time Machine icon) displays a screen containing up to three months of listening history in the form of individual tracks. These also include links to the playlists, albums, or shows that the songs were played from. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe History section will be available to both free-plan members and Premium subscribers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nComing exclusively to Premium users, a new section of six tiles at the top of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> will show new and relevant podcast episodes. New episodes will be marked with a blue dot, and episodes already started by users will display a progress bar indicating how far into the episode they are. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, another Premium-exclusive feature is a new section that will sit under these six tiles to highlight new releases from followed artists. Spotify says this section will be \"personalized, timely, and reactive to your taste.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSpotify says the redesigned Home interface will begin rolling out to both Android and iOS users globally this month.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/spotify-mobile-recently-played-history/\">Spotify Mobile&#039;s Home Hub to Gain Recently Played History and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-mobiles-home-hub-to-gain-recently-played-history-and-more.2289312/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cLcgP-MIcZo:vGndYnxQ5Q0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cLcgP-MIcZo:vGndYnxQ5Q0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cLcgP-MIcZo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f8eb1ba128d9c78a293fb12075633036a3bfd36b9789fd5233e5718cc1c55a15","category":"Apple"}
