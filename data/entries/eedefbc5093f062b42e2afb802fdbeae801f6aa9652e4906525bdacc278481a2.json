Twitter sees\nit as a way to let creators and publishers get paid directly by\ntheir fans.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter also announced a new feature called Communities, which\nappear to be its take on something like Facebook Groups. People\ncan create and join groups around specific interests — like cats\nor plants, Twitter suggests — allowing them to see more tweets\nfocused on those topics. Groups have been a huge success for\nFacebook (and a huge moderation problem, too), and they could be a\nparticularly helpful tool on Twitter, since the service’s\nopen-ended nature can make it difficult for new users to get\nstarted on the platform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both these features sound great. Ben Thompson and I encouraged Twitter to do something like “Super Follows” a few weeks ago on Dithering. Almost certainly, though, all of this will only work in Twitter’s own client, not third-party apps like Tweetbot and Twitterrific.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Twitter Teases Upcoming Features: Paid ‘Super Follows’ and Community Groups’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/25/twitter-super-follows\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eedefbc5093f062b42e2afb802fdbeae801f6aa9652e4906525bdacc278481a2","category":"Tech"}
