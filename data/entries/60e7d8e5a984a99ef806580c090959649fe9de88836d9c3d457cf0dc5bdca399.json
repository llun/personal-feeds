Similar to other keychain accessories, Nomad's Rugged Keychain protects the AirTag in a polycarbonate shell that can be attached to keys, bags, and -- in Nomad's advice -- pet collars.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/rugged-keychain-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Rugged Keychain includes two enclosure options: an IP67 waterproof back and a speaker-hole back.

When asked about this, Drance said, \"If people do that, they just have to make sure that their moving pet gets into range of a device in the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>‌ network\" so its location can be tracked. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNomad <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fcollections%2Fairtags\">already sells a few AirTag accessories</a>, including a Leather Loop and Leather Keychain at $19.95 and $29.95 respectively. You can also purchase a Glasses Strap for AirTag on Nomad for $29.95, which attaches to any pair of glasses or sunglasses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/rugged-keychain-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you're interested in the new Rugged Keychain, you can <a href=\"https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-pet-tag-airtag-black\">pre-order the accessory today</a> in Black or White on Nomad's website for $29.95.
