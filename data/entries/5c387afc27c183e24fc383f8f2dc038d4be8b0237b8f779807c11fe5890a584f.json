This week, <a href=\"https://www.windowslatest.com/2021/05/06/windows-10-sun-valley-update-also-refreshes-icons-in-shell32/\">Windows Latest</a> leaked new detail about the upcoming makeover: There's a new set of icons in <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Shell32.dll</code>replacing classic Windows icons that date back to the Windows 95 era.</p>\n<p>The changes are surprisingly subtle. Most of the new icons are extremely similar to the nearly 30-year old versions they're replacing. Elderly symbols such as floppy disks and floppy disk drives persist in the new icon set—the visual style is updated on these venerable references, but that's about it.</p>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/floppy-vs-floppy.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          The floppy-derived icons in Windows now (right) look like 1990s-era hardware—the Sun Valley refresh replacements (left) look more like late 1970s/early 1980s equipment.
