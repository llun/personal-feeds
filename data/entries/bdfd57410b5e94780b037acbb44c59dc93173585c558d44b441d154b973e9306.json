Read on to learn how it works.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/FaceID-Masked-Blue-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781372\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple introduced its Face ID facial recognition system in November 2017 with the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X, offering users an even simpler way to unlock their smartphone than traditional fingerprint recognition. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFollowing the now-mainstream usage of face masks, however, Apple's biometric feature has been handicapped, leaving many users having to enter their passcode to unlock their device when in public spaces.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFortunately, Apple has responded to this change in our everyday lives by introducing a new feature that allows &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users wearing an Apple Watch to unlock their smartphone via Face ID through a partial face scan, when they're wearing a mask. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe process is similar to how it works when unlocking a Mac with an Apple Watch. When the unlock happens, the user receives a haptic buzz and a notification on the Apple Watch informing them that the unlocking procedure has been successful. However, bear in mind that you can only use your Apple Watch to unlock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; while wearing a mask â€“ it can't be used for authenticating <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBefore you can take advantage of the new feature, you'll need to make sure that you're running either a developer beta or the public betas of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4. You'll need the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch profiles from <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com\">Apple's beta testing website</a>, and after you have them installed, you can update on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to <strong>Settings -> General -> Software Update</strong>. To update your Apple Watch, install iOS 14.5 and then launch the <strong>Watch</strong> app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, tap the <strong>My Watch</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen, then select <strong>General -> Software Update</strong>. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>What You'll Need</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul><li>&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X or later with Face ID</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Apple Watch Series 3 or later</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>iOS 14.5 or later installed on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>watchOS 7.4 or later installed on Apple Watch</li></ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4 updates are currently available for both public beta testers and developers, with a public release expected this spring. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>How to Set Up Unlock iPhone With Apple Watch</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\n<ol><li>Launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Select <strong>Face ID & Passcode</strong>.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Enter your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s passcode.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Scroll down to the section labeled \"Unlock With Apple Watch\" and toggle the switch next to <strong>Apple Watch</strong> to the green ON position. (If the option is greyed out, you need to update the version of watchOS on your Apple Watch.)\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-e1612352290324.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"5202\" height=\"2856\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781661\" /></ol>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>How to Unlock Your iPhone With Apple Watch</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nTo use your Apple Watch to unlock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, your watch needs to be nearby, on your wrist, unlocked, and protected by a passcode. If you haven't set up a passcode yet, launch the <strong>Watch</strong> app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, select <strong>Passcode -> Turn Passcode On</strong>, then enter the passcode you want to use (you'll have to do so twice to confirm.)\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/unlock-iphone-apple-watch.jpg\" alt=\"watch\" width=\"1024\" height=\"890\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781662\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe first time you attempt to unlock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Apple Watch when wearing a mask, your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will ask you to enter your passcode. Once you've done that, all subsequent attempts to unlock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when wearing a mask will be swift and seamless, with each successful unlock accompanied by a short haptic buzz on your wrist. You'll need to re-enter your passcode if you remove your watch and the first time you set it up each day.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/unlock-iphone-wearing-mask-with-apple-watch/\">How to Unlock Your iPhone With Your Apple Watch When Wearing a Mask</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-unlock-your-iphone-with-your-apple-watch-when-wearing-a-mask.2283375/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=12w4zEuR6l8:4h2TDzGgsgE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=12w4zEuR6l8:4h2TDzGgsgE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/12w4zEuR6l8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bdfd57410b5e94780b037acbb44c59dc93173585c558d44b441d154b973e9306","category":"Apple"}
