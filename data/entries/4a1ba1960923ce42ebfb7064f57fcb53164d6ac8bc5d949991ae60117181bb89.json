Hello Sunshine is also involved in several upcoming ‌Apple TV+‌ shows like \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/30/apple-tv-plus-show-surface/\">Surface</a>\" starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-tv-plus-julia-roberts-series/\">The Last Thing He Told Me</a>\" with Julia Roberts, and country music reality series \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/17/apple-tv-plus-my-kind-of-country/\">My Kind of Country</a>.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHello Sunshine reportedly began pursuing a sale in the last couple of months and has received interest from multiple suitors, one of which is Apple. The company could be valued at as much as $1 billion, due to hits like the aforementioned series \"The Morning Show\" and also \"Big Little Lies\" and \"Little Fires Everywhere.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe production company is working with investment bankers to explore its options, and there is no guarantee that it will be sold, nor that Apple will purchase it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf Apple does indeed purchase Hello Sunshine, it could ultimately be folded into Apple Studios, Apple's own production company that is involved with some of its ‌Apple TV+‌ shows. Apple Studios is thus far working on \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/30/apple-tv-plus-show-surface/\">Surface</a>,\" \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/11/apple-tv-snow-blind-jake-gyllenhaal/\">Snow Blind</a>\" with Jake Gyllenhaal, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/01/apple-action-thriller-emancipation/\">Emancipation</a>\" with Will Smith, and \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/27/apple-flower-moon-martin-scorsese/\">Killers of the Flower Moon</a>\" with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/apple-hello-sunshine-possible-purchase/\">Apple Considering Purchasing Reese Witherspoon's 'Hello Sunshine' Media Company</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considering-purchasing-reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-media-company.2303463/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aJ78ZmW1TSo:5YS1E4HHEPY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aJ78ZmW1TSo:5YS1E4HHEPY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/aJ78ZmW1TSo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4a1ba1960923ce42ebfb7064f57fcb53164d6ac8bc5d949991ae60117181bb89","category":"Apple"}
