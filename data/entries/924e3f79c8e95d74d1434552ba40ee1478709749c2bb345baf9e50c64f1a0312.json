The decision was revealed on Wednesday by Chinese state television.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LarryTeds/status/1364553735330963456\">a snippet from an interview</a> with CCTV, the deputy director of the China National Space Agency, Wu Yanhua, said the main purpose of the new rocket is for any \"crewed lunar landing or crewed Mars landing missions\" the country may undertake.</p>\n<p>According to Chinese officials, the country will target the year 2030 for a debut launch. This is consistent with previous timeline estimates. The rocket is planned to have a lift capacity of 140 metric tons, with the capability of sending 50 or more tons into lunar orbit. It would be an immense vehicle, with a 10-meter diameter core and 5-meter side boosters. China would also like to eventually make the rocket, or at least part of it, reusable.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744757#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744757&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"924e3f79c8e95d74d1434552ba40ee1478709749c2bb345baf9e50c64f1a0312","category":"Tech"}
