Tapping automatically flags your location with no confirmation window, so it shouldn't be used except in a valid situation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/accident-reported-ios-14-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1284\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782651\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can also say \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, there's an accident\" and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will send in a report to &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;, and presumably, if enough people file reports, an accident site will show up in the maps app through the crowdsourcing. This is available in the United States in a test capacity at the current time, and it's not yet clear if it's also showing up in other countries. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis also works in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, as noted on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums by <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-ios14-apple-maps-thread.2237669/page-32?post=29591321#post-29591321\">MozMan68</a>, with the reporting interface available on the &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; screen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/carplay-report-accident.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782652\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nNote that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will inform you about the new accident reporting functionality the first time that you seek directions after upgrading to iOS 14.5, but the feature is not mentioned after that. There is no similar accident reporting functionality available in iOS 14.4, and it also does not appear to be showing up for all iOS 14.5 users at this time based on reports <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/lfg9o1/maps_new_accident_reporting_but_i_couldnt_get_it/\">from Reddit</a>, so there is likely a server side element.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/waze/\">Waze</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/ios-14-5-apple-maps-crowdsourcing-accidents/\">Apple Maps Adds Waze-Like Features in iOS 14.5 for Crowdsourcing Accidents, Speed Traps and Hazards</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-adds-waze-like-features-in-ios-14-5-for-crowdsourcing-accidents-speed-traps-and-hazards.2284048/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=D__RbTOw7F4:5KH1byEMjLc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=D__RbTOw7F4:5KH1byEMjLc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/D__RbTOw7F4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5d2e3d8c7336d9f2b65a12d7dcccdcb4385089ea47261ccb01d78e233280a5ee","category":"Apple"}
