Late last year, the Android version of the Play Movies &amp; TV app was <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/02/google-tv-is-replacing-the-old-play-movies-tv/\">rebranded</a> as \"Google TV,\" and now, Google <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/102498448?hl=en\">is announcing</a> (via <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/04/12/google-play-movies-roku-samsung-lg-vizio/\">9to5Google</a>) that on many smart TV platforms, Google's purchased video content will be accessible from the YouTube app. The transition will start June 15, when Google says the \"Google Play Movies &amp; TV app will no longer be available on Roku, Samsung, LG, and Vizio smart TVs.\"</p>\n<p></p><aside><h2>Google kills product</h2>\n\t<ul><li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-is-killing-google-play-movies-tv-on-smart-tvs/\">Google is killing “Google Play Movies &amp; TV” on smart TVs</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/google-is-killing-the-google-shopping-app/\">Google is killing the Google Shopping app</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/googles-vr-dreams-are-dead-google-cardboard-is-no-longer-for-sale/\">Google’s VR dreams are dead: Google Cardboard is no longer for sale</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/google-praised-stadia-studio-for-great-progress-one-week-before-killing-it/\">Ex-Stadia developers dish on Google’s mismanagement and poor communication</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/google-closes-stadias-dedicated-game-studios-after-less-than-2-years/\">Google closes Stadia’s dedicated game studios after less than 2 years</a></li>\n    </ul><span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/\">View more stories</a></span>\n</aside>\nLike any Google service transition (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/\">we are experts</a> at this by now), this move comes with some caveats. Google notes that all your old purchases will be available on YouTube, but new purchases made on YouTube don't support family sharing across family-member accounts. The Google Play TV watchlist also won't be making the jump. Additionally, there are several forum complaints already saying that the YouTube app on certain platforms lacks the surround sound audio or HDR support that Play Movies had.<p></p>\n<p>Google Play Movies &amp; TV launched in 2012 (previously, it was \"Google Movies\") as a way to buy and rent professional, Hollywood-style video content through Google's ecosystem. It launched as part of the unified Google Play ecosystem, alongside the Google Play app store, Google Play Books, Play Music, and Play Magazines. Google Play Magazines eventually became Google Play Newsstand and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/google-news-to-be-revamped-incorporate-youtube-videos-and-magazines/\">shut down</a> in 2018 in favor of the revamped Google News. Google Play Music <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/\">died in 2020</a>, and users were pushed to YouTube Music. That makes two dead Google Play brands so far.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756569#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756569&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f49cf08787526e609cdbadaf09ef72e421857d9c1ec140917d4358418cb1732c","category":"Tech"}
