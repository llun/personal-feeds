Pronouns appear in parentheses next to people's names during a call, as well as under names on user profile cards. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers can also choose if they want their pronoun to be shared in meetings and in webinars. The new profile settings let users \"always share\" (the default), \"do not share,\" or \"ask me every time\" if pronouns should be displayed in each meeting. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nVersion 5.7.0 of Zoom for iOS is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id546505307\">available on the App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/zoom/\">Zoom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/zoom-update-custom-video-filters-pronouns/\">Latest Zoom Update Improves iPad Calls, Adds Custom Video Filters, Gender Pronouns, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-zoom-update-improves-ipad-calls-adds-custom-video-filters-gender-pronouns-and-more.2302108/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=A_13CogcDIs:iuSBEsymz4I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=A_13CogcDIs:iuSBEsymz4I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/A_13CogcDIs\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"baa04f59d46ec1be52e4dbef161d6b5992c2573382f900c002ff2141a87d7844","category":"Apple"}
