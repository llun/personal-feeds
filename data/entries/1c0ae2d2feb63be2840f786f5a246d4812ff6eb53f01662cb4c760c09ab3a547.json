Cavendish sprinted ahead of Nacer Bouhanni and Jasper Philipsen who were second and third respectively. Prior to the stage, Cavendish hadn't won a Tour de France stage since 2016, making his victory one of the most memorable moments in recent Tour de France memory.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\"><b><i>Tour de France 2021 Guide</i></b></a></p>\n<h4><b>Route</b></h4>\n<div><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_PROFILS_ETAPES_SANS_RAVITO_ETP05_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624901092\" />Stage 5 profile</span></i></div>\n<br />\n<div></div>\n<div>Three kilometres separate the start and finish locations of the stage 5 time-trial, but the riders will instead take a 27.2 kilometre course, which is largely flat but also features some short hills. The two intermediate splits take place in Saint-Jean-sur-Mayenne and Bonchamp-les-Laval at kilometres 8.8 and 17.2.</div>\n<div>\n<br />Almost immediately after the rider’s leave the start ramp, they will rise uphill for 1.5 kilometres. The next seven kilometres or so are largely flat and will send the riders to the first time check.</div>\n<br />\n<div></div>\n<div>Rolling terrain characterises the next 15km. With just over 2.2km left, the riders will enter the final short rise. The first 300m of the incline average just over 5%, but the hill levels off to a false flat. The final kilometres in Laval are technical with lots of corners until the finish. The road is narrow too, so the GC favourites must be careful and well prepared so they know exactly how to negotiate this section of the course.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h4><b></b></h4>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20200919TDF0017-A.S.O._Alex_Broadway-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624894375\" />Wout van Aert on the time-trial bike (Image credit: </span></i><i><span>A.S.O./Alex Broadway)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Due to the length of the time-trial, we can expect a major reshuffling in the GC.</span></p>\n<p><span>1.

Both will also have their eyes on yellow. <strong>Wilco Kelderman</strong><span> and </span><strong>Rigoberto Uran</strong><span> are two other well placed GC contenders that will hope to gain time over their competitors.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Primoz Roglic</strong> and <strong>Geraint Thomas</strong> have lost over a minute each, though as strong time-trialists, they'll both hope to move up the standings. Despite that, they have both hit the deck already so may not be at their very best level.</p>\n<p><span>Wout Van Aert starts as the favourite for the stage. After a fairly quiet first couple of stages for the Belgian road champion, Van Aert said he would be focusing on the stage five time-trial rather than sprinting for stages three and four. Ahead of stage three, Van Aert said “Today and tomorrow I will try to save as much energy as possible to do the best time-trial possible.” Van Aert is one of the best on the TT bike in the world. Earlier in 2021, he defeated both Filippo Ganna and <strong>Stefan Kung</strong> over the 10-kilometre Tirreno-Adriatico time-trial.</span></p>\n<p><span>Kung is the Swiss Champion, however, and is one of the primary stage favourites alongside Van Aert. He has won three time-trials this season already, but all his victories were on routes less than 15km in distance. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Kasper Asgreen</strong> is a supreme time-trialist, and although Julian Alaphilippe won a time-trial in 2019 on a similar route, Asgreen could be Deceuninck-Quick Step’s best option. Asgreen will wear the Danish champions jersey after he defeated Mikkel Bjerg over a 48km race prior to the Tour de France.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Stefan Bissegger</strong> is one of the breakout riders of 2021 so far. The 22-year-old is proving himself as one of the best time-trialists in the WorldTour peloton. Bissegger won the 14km TT at Paris-Nice ahead of </span><span>Primoz Roglic and Remi Cavagna. However, this will be the longest time-trial course he has tackled this season. </span></p>\n<p><span>Other riders with a chance of finishing near the top of the stage standings include <strong>Mikkel Bjerg, Brandon McNulty </strong>and<strong> Søren Kragh Andersen.</strong></span></p>\n<h4><span><strong>Notable Start Times</strong></span></h4>\n<p>12:31 Chris Froome<br />12:52 Mikkel Bjerg<br />14:19 Stefan Bissegger<br />15:31 Stefan Kung<br />16:08 Kasper Asgreen<br />16:12 Primoz Roglic<br />16:16 Geraint Thomas<br />16:24 Rigoberto Uran<br />16:40 Tadej Pogacar<br />16:44 Wout van Aert<br />16:48 Julian Alaphilippe<br />16:50 Mathieu van der Poel</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021-stage-6-preview-the-tour-returns-to-chateauroux\"><em><span><strong>Read our full stage 6 preview</strong></span></em></a></p>\n<h4><b>Prediction</b></h4>\n<p><span>Wout van Aert has had a consistent if not unspectacular start to the Tour de France and finds himself 31 seconds behind in the GC. That won’t phase Van Aert though, who turned his attention to the time-trial early on. He is our pick to win stage 5, and such is his time-trialling prowess, we think he will move into the yellow jersey as well.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"1c0ae2d2feb63be2840f786f5a246d4812ff6eb53f01662cb4c760c09ab3a547","category":"Cycling"}
