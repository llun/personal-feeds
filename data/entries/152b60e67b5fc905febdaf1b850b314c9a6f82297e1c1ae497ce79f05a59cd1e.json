They should have just come clean and explained that they were short of cash to cover all the action on these stocks. But because they were embarrassed to appear insolvent, they destroyed their ethical reputation instead. And now it’s come out that they were in over their heads financially anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Even today, Robinhood is not even close to allowing users to trade GameStop freely. A friend with a Robinhood account was only able to buy <em>five shares</em> <a href=\"/misc/2021/01/robinhood-error.jpeg\">before getting an error message that he held the maximum number of shares</a>. And when you sell GameStop on Robinhood, you can only sell at market price, not a limit order. It’s a complete clown show.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Robinhood Needed Emergency $1 Billion Cash Injection, Yet Remains Underfunded’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/29/robinhood-cash-injection\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"152b60e67b5fc905febdaf1b850b314c9a6f82297e1c1ae497ce79f05a59cd1e","category":"Tech"}
