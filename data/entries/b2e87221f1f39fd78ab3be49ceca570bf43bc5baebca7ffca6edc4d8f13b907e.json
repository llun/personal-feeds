Raycast is a new “Spotlight on steroids” utility for the Mac. I’ve been using it all week and it’s great — very fast, looks cool, and <a href=\"https://github.com/raycast/script-commands\">richly extensible through custom script commands</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Raycast can fully replace Spotlight, and it really stands apart with its \nintegrations of third party services. Without leaving the application, you can create an issue in Jira, review pull requests in GitHub, or join a Zoom call. You can personalize your workflows further with the aforementioned scripting interface and an upcoming API. Raycast is a beautiful true Mac app that brings clarity back to your daily work. <a href=\"https://raycast.com/?ref=daringfireball-rss\">Download it for free to get started.</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/18/raycast\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b2e87221f1f39fd78ab3be49ceca570bf43bc5baebca7ffca6edc4d8f13b907e","category":"Tech"}
