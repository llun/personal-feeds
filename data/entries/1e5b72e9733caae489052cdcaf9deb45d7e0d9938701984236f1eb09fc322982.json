On Thursday, the company halted users’ ability to buy\nstocks that were associated with r/WallStreetBets, including\nGameStop, AMC, and Nokia, but the company promised that users\nwould be able to buy limited quantities on Friday. Today, it\nreleased <a href=\"https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/\">a shifting support document</a> that details just how\nlimited things are — and to slightly paraphrase Lando, the deal’s\ngetting worse all the time.</p>\n\n<p>When trading opened earlier today, users were limited to owning\nfive shares of GameStop in aggregate, meaning they could only own\nup to five — if they already had three GameStop stocks, they\ncould only buy two more — but even that restriction hasn’t\nlasted. Soon, the number of shares you could buy in GME dropped to\ntwo and then finally down to a single share. That’s right: you\ncouldn’t buy more than one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One share. At least the stock that so many Robinhood users wanted to buy <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME\">only went up 70 percent</a> today, so I’m sure no one is angry.</p>\n\n<p>Robinhood’s <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/robinhoods-let-people-trade-tweet-resurfaces-after-platform-halts-gamestop-trading-1565156\">old slogan</a>: “Let the people trade.”</p>\n\n<p>New slogan: “Play with us at the kiddie table.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘5-4-3-2-1: Robinhood’s Reputation Drops Along With the Number of Shares They Let Users Buy’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/29/robinhood-kiddie-table\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1e5b72e9733caae489052cdcaf9deb45d7e0d9938701984236f1eb09fc322982","category":"Tech"}
