There's a redesigned Home experience, search has been relocated to the left side of the navigation page, and listener profile pages feature top artists and tracks. Users can now start a radio session for any song or artist using the \"...\" menu.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's easier than ever to edit and customize playlists, and there's a new embedded search bar for quickly locating new songs and podcast episodes to add. With a new dropdown menu in the top-right corner, Spotify desktop app users can edit Queue and view Recently played.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSpotify users on Mac <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/download/mac/\">can download</a> the new Spotify app for desktop from the Spotify website or use Spotify in the browser through <a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/\">open.spotify.com</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/spotify-redesign-desktop-app-web-player/\">Spotify Launches New Design for Desktop App and Web Player</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-launches-new-design-for-desktop-app-and-web-player.2289586/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BcF-cwmevCg:XPcbVHYQ6IM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BcF-cwmevCg:XPcbVHYQ6IM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BcF-cwmevCg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7948cc409b6f4438635f13586bf72896968b6eb5ed8dd51d9dbaf35e6b3f12ac","category":"Apple"}
