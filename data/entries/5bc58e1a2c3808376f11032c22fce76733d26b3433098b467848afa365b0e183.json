Santa Cruz’s says: “the TR is not a trail bike, it’s a XC bike for certain courses.”</p>\n\n<h2>Santa Cruz Blur and Juliana Wilder frames</h2>\n<p>All three families of bikes use the same frame, the only difference is the stroke of the shock to give the 100mm or 115mm of travel on offer.</p>\n<p>As we’ve come to expect, both ‘C’ and ‘CC’ level carbon frames will be available, with the ‘CC’ frames getting a higher modulus carbon – basically, stiffer for the weight or lighter for the stiffness, depending on how you look at it!</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Yes, that’s three bottle cages mounted to an XC race frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<p>Santa Cruz is claiming that it’s cut significant weight (289g ) from the previous version of the Blur via the suspension linkage described below and a couple of other tricks.</p>\n<p>For example, the use of different paints makes a difference. There’s a Salmon version but also a Dark Matter option. This darker paint is 48g lighter on a size Large frame than its brighter Salmon cousin.</p>\n<p>The size Large frame, with a 235g RockShox SidLuxe shock and hardware (excluding axle) weighs 1,933g. Santa Cruz says <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/dear-cycling-industry-why-do-you-suck-at-weighing-and-measuring-things/\">no funny tricks have been used</a> to get to this weight either. Once we get one in, perhaps we’ll strip it down to confirm!</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Though chainguides add weight, they’re a common sight on XC bikes, as dropping chains costs time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<p>The frame itself has space for two bottle cages inside the frame, as well as one under the down tube and comes with rubberised chainstay protection, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">SRAM’s universal derailleur hanger (UDH)</a>, lifetime warranty on bearings, as well as a down tube protector and mini chainguide.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz says there are no proprietary parts either, which should make fixing the bike away from home a bit easier.</p>\n<h2>Santa Cruz Blur and Juliana Wilder suspension</h2>\n<p>Those who’ve followed the Santa Cruz and Juliana brands over the years will be aware of their extensive use of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">VPP (or Virtual Pivot Point) suspension linkage</a>, whereby the front and rear triangles are joined with a pair of rotating links.</p>\n<p>However, these bikes eschew the slightly more complex and heavier system in favour of a linkage-driven single pivot design, with flex stays to give additional control over the bike’s suspension kinematic.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Chainstays and seatstays flex to manipulate the suspension’s performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<p>Flex stays aren’t new anymore and are used on a vast array of lighter weight bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-specialized-epic-and-epic-evo/\">Specialized Epic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-cannondale-scalpel/\">Cannondale Scalpel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-merida-ninety-six/\">Merida Ninety-Six</a> – all of which have XC and trail versions.</p>\n<p>By eliminating a rear pivot and relying on the characteristics of the carbon layup, Santa Cruz says that it’s cut 289g out of the frame, compared to the Blur 3 that came before it.</p>\n<p>When it comes to XC-focused bikes, pedalling characteristics are obviously vital. The Blur and Wilder approach this slightly differently to many other bikes by using a lower shock leverage curve to provide the support and control rather than focussing on increasing anti-squat (the resistance to the suspension compressing under pedalling forces).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s in the leverage curve of the shock that the bike’s pedalling performance comes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<p>This lower leverage curve means the anti-squat figure can be dropped for less interference between the pedals and rear suspension, especially on bigger hits.</p>\n<p>This, in theory, means a smoother riding feel over rough terrain, as well as more traction and sensitivity both up and downhill.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz is also claiming that it’s a more efficient system overall because less of your energy is used by the anti-squat to counter pedalling and body weight impacts on the suspension.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A paired down single link drives the shock, rather than the usual pair of a VPP system.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<h2>Santa Cruz Blur and Juliana Wilder geometry</h2>\n<p>XC bikes aren’t immune to modern <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">mountain bike geometry trends</a>, with the Blur and Wilder getting the longer, lower, slacker treatment.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The brake caliper is nestled into the rear triangle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s also given each size its own chainstay lengths, to keep front and rear ends in proportion across sizes. This is increasingly common on mountain bikes, but still not overly common itself, and certainly not on XC bikes. Santa Cruz’s chainstays vary from 430mm (S) to 438mm (XL).</p>\n<p>The theory goes that a fixed chainstay length of (say) 440mm on an XS bike with a reach of 430mm is going to feel wildly different in terms of front/rear balance if that same 440mm chainstay is used on an XL version of the same bike with, say, a 510mm reach.</p>\n<p>Santa Cruz is altering the rear chainstay length by adjusting its relatively fixed points in the front triangle, thus avoiding having to open a new set of molds for each rear triangle.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seatstays have a bridge-less design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz / Juliana</i></span></div>\n<p>Compares to the previous generation bikes, head angles are said to be 0.7 degrees slacker on the Blur XC and 1.4 degrees slacker on the Blur TR, and they’re now designed to run a 60mm stem.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the Wilder, three sizes will be available: S, M and L.</p>\n<p>Here are the key numbers for a Large Blur (non-TR/TR)</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reach</strong>: 470mm / 458mm</li>\n<li><strong>Stack</strong>: 597mm / 607mm</li>\n<li><strong>Head angle</strong>: 68.3 degrees / 67.1 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube length</strong>: 470mm</li>\n<li><strong>Bottom bracket height</strong>: 331mm / 340mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelbase</strong>: 1,173mm / 1,183mm</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube angle</strong>: 75.8 degrees / 74.9 degrees</li>\n</ul><h2>Santa Cruz Blur and Juliana Wilder models</h2>\n<h3>Santa Cruz Blur XC builds</h3>\n<p>The Blur XC gets 100mm of travel at both ends of the bike, with a RockShox suspension package: <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-rockshox-sid-forks-and-shock/\">a SID SL fork and SIDLuxe shock</a>.</p>\n<p>They come with fast-rolling Maxxis Aspen tyres and lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a>.
