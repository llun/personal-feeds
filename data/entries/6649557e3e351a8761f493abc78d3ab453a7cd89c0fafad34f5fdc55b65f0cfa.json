Some of these date back many years. But others have quietly been added. Review these settings to see if you can sand down some friction in your Finder experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/macos-big-sur-advanced-finder-preferences.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1190\" /><figcaption><p>The Finder’s Advanced preferences let you tweak Finder-wide settings that may mildly frustrate you.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Show all filename extensions <em>and</em> Show warning before changing an extension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These options have appeared forever and a day, and affect the ever less-important visible indication of what follows a period at the end of a file name, and thus in part determines which app opens a file. You can choose (the default) to never see extensions; but if you see them, you may want to prevent changing them, which can make a file hard to access or which opens it in the wrong app.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Show warning before removing from iCloud Drive <em>and</em> Show warning before emptying the Trash</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another set of paired warnings, the iCloud Drive choice arrived with that cloud-based sync-and-storage system. You may want to keep both checked, despite the annoyance, because the warning can help you if you inadvertently hit the Empty Trash keystroke (Command-Shift-Delete).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remove items from the Trash after 30 days</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The one bit of automation in these preferences. You can treat your Trash as a holding area, much the way the Photos app holds deleted images in a special album for about a month. You send an item to the Trash with Command-Delete, and if you didn’t need it in 30 days, perhaps you never needed it at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep folders on top</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some folks prefer folders and files kept separately, though this has always been more of a Windows thing. Nonetheless, it’s an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When performing a search</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spotlight searching in macOS has a “scope,” which means the area of files being searched. The choice labeled This Mac searches the entire set of mounted volumes, while the current folder and Recents also appear as options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you always want to have a search default to scoping the folder you’re viewing in a Finder window, you can make that selection. Or, as is generally more useful, Use the Previous Search Scope always brings up your last choice until you change the scope again.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
