The majority of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a> in the country have remained closed, while others such as Apple Champs-Élysées, Apple Opéra, Apple Marché Saint-Germain, and Apple Lille, remained open for customers according to <em><a href=\"https://www.macg.co/aapl/2021/03/confinement-les-apple-store-de-paris-et-lille-restent-ouverts-120317\">MacGeneration</a></em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple says that the closures will be temporary and offers no date for when customers can expect them to reopen. Stores that were open previously, such as Apple Champs-Élysées and Apple Opéra, will remain open until Saturday, April 3, for customers to pick up current online orders or attend a Genius Bar appointment that was scheduled before April 3.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, even with stores open, Apple has in place strict measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and temperature checks. Apple has taken a cautious approach to closing and reopening its stores as the pandemic situation differs.
