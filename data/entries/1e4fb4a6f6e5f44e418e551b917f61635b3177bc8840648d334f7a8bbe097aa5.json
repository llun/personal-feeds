{"title":"How to Use the New Apple TV Remote’s Jog-Shuttle Gesture","link":"https://www.loopinsight.com/2021/05/26/close-up-view-of-the-siri-remote-jog-shuttle-gesture/","date":1622402049000,"content":"\n<p>Good video demo from Dave Mark. The non-obvious trick is that you need to first pause the video you’re watching, then hold your thumb on the ring for a moment before you start spinning. You know you’re in jog mode when you see the jog cursor above the timeline of the video on screen. (In a nice touch, the rotating dot on the on-screen jog dial keeps pace with your thumb’s location on the physical ring.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, I made a mistake in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/05/the_new_siri_remote_etc\">my review of the new remote</a>: you can’t really use it to scroll through vertical lists on tvOS (like in the Settings app). Running your thumb around the ring in a vertical list does move the selection, but it moves the selection up and down as your thumb goes up and down. We regret the error. (This would be a nice feature for Apple to add to tvOS, in my opinion — it <em>should</em> work for scrolling lists.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/30/mark-apple-tv-remote-jog-gesture\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1e4fb4a6f6e5f44e418e551b917f61635b3177bc8840648d334f7a8bbe097aa5","category":"Tech"}
