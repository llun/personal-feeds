And we’re also betting you don’t want to buy them an expensive phone with a cellular plan. Today’s deal covers all of your bases. Amazon’s Woot is selling a fully unlocked refurbished iPhone SE for $250, about 40 percent off the MSRP and a great price for a phone without a contract commitment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only possible drawback is that this is a “scratched and dented” model, which means it could have some cosmetic imperfections. But it’ll probably get that way after a few days with your kid anyway. (In fact, we picked the iPhone SE as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334296/the-best-iphone-for-kids.html\">the best phone for younger kids</a> for this very reason.) Other than the minor wear and tear, it’s guaranteed to be in full working condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing about this particular deal is that you’re getting an unlocked phone that doesn’t need a contract. It’s basically an iPod touch with a bigger screen, faster processor, more storage, Touch ID, and a better camera. Plus you’ll get many years of software updates and a 90-day warranty. And what’s best, your kid will love it.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>iPhone SE (Refurbished)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/iphone-se-2020.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.woot.com/offers/apple-iphone-se-fully-unlocked-sd-2?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_8&amp;xcust=1-1-342850-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">US$250 at Woot!</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a64489f83fa17f25b4f1812ea5f61073533a707eb17588a7ae04bb797807c055","category":"Apple"}
