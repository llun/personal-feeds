A review in the time it takes to brew a good cup of coffee. I know you&#8217;re a busy cyclist, but at the same time looking for a bit of insight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get quite a bit of kit through the revolving CT doors here. Some of it outstanding, other bits good and some just not worth a mention. In this new video series, I&#8217;m going to be aiming to cover a plethora of goodies, not just the high-end items and big-ticket products. Yes, I&#8217;m sure there will be a smattering of that stuff, but in all honesty, I want the Brew Review series to be a place where you look if you&#8217;ve got a spare bit of cash burning a hole in your jersey pocket, a place where you can look to for advice on items that generally need replacing every few years or so. I&#8217;ll review things that you&#8217;ll want to use every day, every season and on every ride, or at least that&#8217;s the aim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as for the name, Brew Review.

I&#8217;ll keep them to the sort of length of time it takes to put the kettle on, get the biscuits out and get the brew ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to kick off the series I thought I&#8217;d start at the top with a helmet that has taken my fancy over the past few monthsâ€”the all-new Scott Centric Plus.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/brew-review-scott-centric-plus-helmet/\">Brew Review: Scott Centric Plus helmet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9de68bb22a3a1567678167a68c60d1ca779f18b882e2893d8d87b2c61088d074","category":"Cycling"}
