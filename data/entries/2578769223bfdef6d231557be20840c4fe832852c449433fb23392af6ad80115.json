In a new episode of Front Page Tech, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhLRbrrkSlY&amp;xcust=1-1-345762-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">guerilla leaker Jon Prosser</a> claims that Apple is developing a new MacBook or MacBook Air that comes in colors. Prosser says the source that fed him the info is the same that accurately predicted the iMac colors before everyone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revelation isn’t a complete surprise following the launch of the 24-inch iMac. Apple’s new all-in-one is a throwback to the original iMac G3, which was followed a year later by the matching iBook. If Apple is drawing a colorful line between its consumer and pro products, it makes sense that new MacBook hues will be arriving.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure><p>In fact, Prosser’s source used that very graphic of the iBook introduction to tease the leak, claiming they “recently saw a blue MacBook prototype that looked absolutely amazing.” Apple already delineates the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343025/11-inch-ipad-pro-vs-ipad-air-m1-performance-display-design-specs-5g-apple-pencil-camera-price.html\">iPad Air </a>and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234701/iphone-12-mini-vs-iphone-12-pro-max-design-display-performance-camera-battery-price.html\">iPhone 12</a> from the iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro using colors, so it’s logical that the MacBook would be next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Prosser speculates that the colorized machine would be the MacBook Air, it’s notable that his source only refers to the new notebook as a “MacBook.” Apple previously sold a laptop under the name MacBook in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/180129/mbookmain.html\">2006</a> and again in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2908115/review-the-new-12-inch-macbook-is-a-laptop-without-an-ecosystem.html\">2015</a>, so it’s possible that Apple revives the name once again. But either way, such a laptop would likely arrive in the fall at or around <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234860/apple-m1-macs-what-you-need-to-know-about-buying-new-apple-silicon-macs.html\">the anniversary of the M1 processor</a>.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2578769223bfdef6d231557be20840c4fe832852c449433fb23392af6ad80115","category":"Apple"}
