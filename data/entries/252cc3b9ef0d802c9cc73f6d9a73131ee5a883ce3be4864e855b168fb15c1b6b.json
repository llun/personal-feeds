This means a more austere appearance—particularly in the case of the T-Pro 2, which doesn't share the Fnatic's and Kaiser 2's neck-height \"wings.\" Much like the Fnatic, these are excellent chairs—but having all three on hand at once made it clear how important picking the <em>right</em> chair for you and your body really is.</p>\n<h2>Unboxing and assembly</h2>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20200927_161004-980x735.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Presentation in the box is not something Anda cares about—\"it's all crammed in there good enough.\"                      [credit:\n                        Jim Salter                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>Assembling the Fnatic, Kaiser 2, and T-Pro 2 chairs all follows the same, simple blueprint:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747075#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747075&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"252cc3b9ef0d802c9cc73f6d9a73131ee5a883ce3be4864e855b168fb15c1b6b","category":"Tech"}
