Norway is doing better at EV adoption than the US. Much better, in fact, as 54 percent of all new vehicles sold in the Scandinavian country in 2020 were electric. Here in the US, plug-in vehicles accounted for <a href=\"https://www.ev-volumes.com\">a mere 2.2 percent</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/2020-truck-suv-car-sales-winners-and-losers/\">14.6 million new cars and trucks sold last year</a> (although in absolute numbers, the US still bought about three times as many EVs as Norway).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741431#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741431&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
