Aeron is Dhb’s more performance-orientated cycle kit range, sitting above the Blok and Classic, but below the Aeron Lab range.</p>\n<p>Aeron Lab kit is designed to be race-ready with a tight fit and prices heading up to £125 for a jersey. In contrast, the standard Aeron jersey is a slightly more relaxed fit and mid-priced and would suit the sportiviste and serious recreational rider.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9570/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/dhb_aeron_ss_jersey_2.jpg?itok=5c5fu1ya\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>5</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Whereas Aeron Lab has spawned a whole variety of different jerseys, designed for UV protection or light and lighter weight, the Aeron jersey sticks to a more limited selection designed either for road or for cross country MTB use.</p>\n<p>The Aeron jersey doesn't lack quality features though. The main body is made of a fabric that’s pretty lightweight, so it’s comfortable when it gets warm. That’s supplemented by stretchy mesh panels on the sides under the arms and down the centre of the back and there’s even a strip of mesh all the way along the rear under the pockets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-4\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Dhb Aeron jersey now from Wiggle</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>With mid-back often being one of the first places to get sweaty in the heat, it’s nice to have some extra airflow there.</p>\n<p>Dhb says that the fabric used for the Aeron jersey is antibacterial treated. That should help with comfort on long, hot rides. Despite the generally rather chilly weather so far this spring, I managed to find some warmer, still days to ride in the Aeron jersey and it was certainly less whiffy than many when I got back from pounding the hills in the Chilterns.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9570/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/dhb_aeron_ss_jersey_4.jpg?itok=Pt0YLiBs\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>5</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>There’s no seam over the top of the shoulder and the sleeves run down to broad raw edged grippers with silicone dots on the inside, which keep them in place effectively.</p>\n<p>There’s a slightly differential cut at the bottom of the body, to reflect the different coverage needs front to back when bent over the bars, and the bottom hem is kept in place effectively by a silicone gripper.</p>\n<p>There was a bit of excess fabric around the belly when riding, but nothing excessive and the thin, stretchy fabric means that overall the fit is reasonably close without being restrictive.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9570/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/dhb_aeron_ss_jersey_5.jpg?itok=SFokSzXV\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>5</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>All three rear pockets have gussets at their bottoms, so it’s easy to load up with extra stuff for extended rides, and the centre one has a dart of reflective black material, to add even more capacity and a bit of low light visibility. There’s a fourth zipped pocket for your keys and cash.</p>\n<p>There is a wide range of different sizes available for the Aeron: everything from XS up to XXXL, fitting chests from 86cm up to 126cm according to Dhb’s size chart, and there are women’s sizes 8 to 16 available too.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/specialized/9053/specialized-hotwalk-carbon-balance-bike\">Specialized Hotwalk Carbon balance bike: behind the scenes look at £999 kids' bike</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/5323/best-childrens-bikes\">Best children’s bikes: top picks of kids' bikes for every age</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8997/best-children-s-helmets-top-picks-of-kids-cycling-helmets-for-every-age\">Best children’s helmets: top picks of kids' cycling helmets for every age</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\n<a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-4\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Dhb Aeron jersey now from Wiggle</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Men’s colours stretch to nine options and women’s to four, from brights through muted to black, reflecting the popularity of the Aeron short sleeve jersey as a warm weather option.</p>\n<p>Like other Dhb kit, the Aeron jersey is available online via both <a href=\"https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-4\" target=\"_blank\">Wiggle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey/rp-prod182249\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9570/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos\">dhb Aeron short sleeve jersey photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/paul-norman\">Paul Norman</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>5 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9570%2Fdhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=dhb%20Aeron%20short%20sleeve%20jersey%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9570%2Fdhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=dhb%20Aeron%20short%20sleeve%20jersey%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9570%2Fdhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=dhb%20Aeron%20short%20sleeve%20jersey%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9570%2Fdhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9570/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 5</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/dhb_aeron_ss_jersey_1.jpg?itok=qM65t3q9\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/jerseys\">Jerseys</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"41f322fbe883c4b9eba60adc12bff61747e6aba6b756921f9231e38cbf89b724","category":"Cycling"}
