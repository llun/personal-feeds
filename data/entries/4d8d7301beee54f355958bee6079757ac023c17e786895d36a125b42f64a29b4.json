After a few moments, Carapaz returned to a more standard position on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was ultimately reeled back in, and then after the race ended (with <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/tadej-pogacar-is-living-the-cycling-dream/\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogacar taking the win</a>), he was listed as disqualified in the official results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least in images circulated on social media after the race, Carapaz did appear to maintain some contact with his saddle while in the position, but the race jury decided to disqualify him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ineos Grenadiers have since confirmed to CyclingTips that the disqualification was due to Carapaz having ridden in the “super tuck” position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “super tuck” and a few other positions have been explicitly banned, with riders facing disqualification for riding in those positions, since <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/the-uci-is-banning-the-super-tuck/\" target=\"_blank\">new rules</a> went into effect on April 1.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Carapaz has been disqualified. Thought it would be accepted because seat’s point of contact is on the saddle and not on the top tube. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LBL21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LBL21</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WOPVnDisRp\">pic.twitter.com/WOPVnDisRp</a></p>\n<p>— La Flamme Rouge (@laflammerouge16) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laflammerouge16/status/1386339225377853447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 25, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/richard-carapaz-disqualified-for-super-tucking-at-liege-bastogne-liege/\">Richard Carapaz disqualified for super-tucking at Liège-Bastogne-Liège</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4d8d7301beee54f355958bee6079757ac023c17e786895d36a125b42f64a29b4","category":"Cycling"}
