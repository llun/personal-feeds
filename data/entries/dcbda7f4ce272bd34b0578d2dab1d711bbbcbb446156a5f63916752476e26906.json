So far, however, researchers have yet to observe delivery of any payload on any of the infected 30,000 machines, leaving the malware’s ultimate goal unknown. The lack of a final payload suggests that the malware may spring into action once an unknown condition is met.</p>\n<p>Also curious, the malware comes with a mechanism to completely remove itself, a capability that’s typically reserved for high-stealth operations. So far, though, there are no signs the self-destruct feature has been used, raising the question why the mechanism exists.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744063#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744063&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dcbda7f4ce272bd34b0578d2dab1d711bbbcbb446156a5f63916752476e26906","category":"Tech"}
