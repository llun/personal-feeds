The existing ‌AppleCare‌ plans that are being extended do not include accidental damage coverage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AppleCare‌+ for ‌Apple TV‌ is priced at $29, with a monthly purchase option also available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Mark and Ryan!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/04/apple-extends-applecare-for-apple-tv/\">Apple Extends Standard AppleCare Plans for Apple TV From Two Years to Three</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-extends-standard-applecare-plans-for-apple-tv-from-two-years-to-three.2294844/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6y2VSJBPWsg:TbYPinG8MFs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6y2VSJBPWsg:TbYPinG8MFs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6y2VSJBPWsg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c0956f95575cfc0a8b53f5370dd40670c6029ce8b1136c67944aa80d28f15179","category":"Apple"}
