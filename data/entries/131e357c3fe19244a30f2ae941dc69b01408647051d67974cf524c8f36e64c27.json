{"title":"Sendy: Self-Hosted Newsletter Service Built Atop Amazon SES","link":"https://sendy.co/","date":1614360759000,"content":"\n<p>Sendy is an interesting newsletter service recommended by a longtime DF reader:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sendy is a self hosted email newsletter application that lets you\nsend trackable emails via <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">Amazon Simple Email Service\n(SES)</a>. This makes it possible for you to send authenticated\nbulk emails at an insanely low price without sacrificing\ndeliverability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You need to host the PHP application yourself (more or less like self-hosting, say, WordPress), but the emails go out via Amazon’s service. Sendy makes it easy to disable tracking pixels, and, even if you do track subscribers, the tracking information never involves any third parties, including Sendy. Just you.</p>\n\n<p>Sendy’s big pitch isn’t privacy but cost: they claim to be 100-200 times cheaper than MailChimp or Campaign Monitor.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Sendy: Self-Hosted Newsletter Service Built Atop Amazon SES’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/26/sendy\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"131e357c3fe19244a30f2ae941dc69b01408647051d67974cf524c8f36e64c27","category":"Tech"}
