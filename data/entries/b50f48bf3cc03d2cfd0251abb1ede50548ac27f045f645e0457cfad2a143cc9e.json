Let’s say\nWindows has a billion users. So does Android. So does iOS. In\nfact, Android and iOS will have more than a billion users perhaps,\nor maybe Android has 2 billion, [and] maybe iOS is similar to\nWindows’s size or what have you. But the reality is any Windows user — we have to start with the assumption that they have a phone and\nthat phone may be Android and iOS and we have to design for it.</p>\n\n<p>I do think that operating systems are important, but they’re\nimportant in so far as they compose with everything else that’s\npart of my life, whether it’s other devices with other operating\nsystems, [or] whether it is clouds that I use, which are powering\nsome of the applications and experiences.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a practical reality, really. Let’s meet Windows users\nwhere they are, and meet their current needs and unmet,\nunarticulated needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/24/windows-10-ui-layers\">crack wise</a> about the inelegance of Windows, but I do think that under Nadella, Microsoft knows what Windows is and what it’s supposed to be, and Windows 11 is exactly that. That’s a strength. That <em>know thyself</em> confidence comes across in this interview.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/28/nadella-patel\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b50f48bf3cc03d2cfd0251abb1ede50548ac27f045f645e0457cfad2a143cc9e","category":"Tech"}
