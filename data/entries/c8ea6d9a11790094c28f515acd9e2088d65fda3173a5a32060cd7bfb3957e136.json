Those rumors, however, did not come to fruition. Interestingly, though, Apple lists \"m1x MacBook Pro\" as a tag for the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs\">WWDC keynote uploaded on YouTube</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/m1x-mbp-tags-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe tag, first spotted by Apple YouTuber <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxbalzer_/status/1402626084265500679\">Max Balzer on Twitter</a>, is among other tags Apple has added to the video, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, M1X, iOS, developers conference, and more. Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon chip in November, and speculation has suggested that the next chip, expected in the redesigned MacBook Pros, would be called \"m1x.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe inclusion of the tag, while not totally indicative, may suggest that Apple does plan to call the upcoming chip \"m1x,\" or, more likely, is simply using the rumor mill as a way to bump up the WWDC keynote in YouTube search results. <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman has stated that the new MacBook Pros could debut <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/macbook-pro-64gb-ram-summer-2021/\">as soon as early this summer</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/apple-m1x-macbook-pro-wwdc-keynote/\">Apple Lists 'M1X MacBook Pro' in YouTube Tags for WWDC Keynote Video</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lists-m1x-macbook-pro-in-youtube-tags-for-wwdc-keynote-video.2300075/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JMkmooZP7ls:MxgLuKYooLM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JMkmooZP7ls:MxgLuKYooLM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JMkmooZP7ls\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c8ea6d9a11790094c28f515acd9e2088d65fda3173a5a32060cd7bfb3957e136","category":"Apple"}
