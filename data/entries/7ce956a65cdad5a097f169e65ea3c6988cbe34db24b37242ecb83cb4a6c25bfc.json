As such, we're resurfacing a few classics from the Ars archives, including this somewhat masochistic experiment. Back in 2014, Ars' Editor Emeritus Sean Gallagher decided to celebrate the 20th anniversary of MS-DOS's end-of-life by working <em>in</em> the operating system within a modern context. It... went about as smoothly as you'd expect. <p>Now 27 years after Microsoft announced that it would end support for the MS-DOS, we're resurfacing this exercise (and very much appreciating our present day options as we all work from home a bit more). This story originally ran on July 3, 2014, and it appears unchanged below.</p></em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Twenty years ago this week, as Microsoft announced that it would end support for the MS-DOS operating system, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.msdos.apps/oQmT4ETcSzU/O1HR8PE2u-EJ\">James Hall announced to the world</a> that he intended to create a public domain version of the OS in order to keep the universe of character-based DOS software alive. Hall’s “PD-DOS” project eventually became <a href=\"http://www.freedos.org/\">FreeDOS</a>, which today supports an ecosystem of developers, retro gamers, and diehards who will give up their WordStar when you pry the floppies from their cold, dead fingers.</p>\n\n<p>In tribute to the project's two decades (and to those brave souls who keep the DOS fires burning), I decided to spend a day this week working in FreeDOS. I set up a machine running the latest distribution of the OS along with software from the FreeDOS Package Manager repositories. I then added whatever other software I could scrape together—open source software, freeware, and “abandonware” found on the Web, plus some software graciously sent by Lee Hutchinson from his own personal reserve of DOSware. I wanted to know if it was possible to do modern Web-based work in DOS—and just how painful it might prove to be.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=498855#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=498855&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sean Gallagher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ce956a65cdad5a097f169e65ea3c6988cbe34db24b37242ecb83cb4a6c25bfc","category":"Tech"}
