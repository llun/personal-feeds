Rocket Lake-S is still stuck on Intel's venerable 14 nm process—we've long since lost count of how many pluses to tack onto the end—with features backported from newer 10 nm designs.</p>\n<p>Clock speed on Rocket Lake-S remains high, but thread counts have decreased on the high end. Overall, most benchmarks show Rocket Lake-S underperforming last year's Comet Lake—let alone its real competition, coming from AMD Ryzen CPUs.</p>\n<p>Our hands-on test results did not seem to match up with Intel's marketing claims of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/intel-rocket-lake-s-desktop-gaming-cpus-are-here\">up to 19 percent</a> gen-on-gen IPC (Instructions Per Clock cycle) improvement over its 10th-generation parts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752990#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752990&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e235544e0e26ff6d6374a6b93e6639a84a3fcbeb18e4db6fe53e573ebb186af","category":"Tech"}
