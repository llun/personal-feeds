As it turns out, more than a few of you didn’t buy anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>T-minus 30 minutes till preorders (we think).

We figured the poll would be a healthy mix of the three products, but we weren’t expecting a clear majority of “Nothing.” A lot of you have been waiting for a new iMac, a new Siri Remote was high on everyone’s wish list, and the mini LED display is one of Apple’s best display innovations in years. And when we dug a little deeper, it appeared that there were a few recurring issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>We need your help with a story. If you wanted to preorder one of Apple's new devices but didn't why? (None of these?

Apple only offers a 256GB SSD in the $1,299 and $1,499 iMac models, with upgrades starting at $200. That’s not a lot of storage for a desktop computer—though to be fair, Apple’s $5,999 Mac Pro also starts at 256GB of storage—and many of you felt you were being nickel-and-dimed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>To start iMac out with only 256GB of storage in 2021 is insulting to consumers, and so 2007. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/WDkyy6kRFe&amp;xcust=1-1-345068-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/WDkyy6kRFe</a></p>— Tim (@timswork) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/timswork/status/1388099945853509633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-345068-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 30, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I wanted to be in the iMac group. Then Apple decided to get chintzy with the SSD capacities and skimp on ports and such until you get into the $1500 and up range.

Also the lack of USB-A ports, and I do still need Boot Camp. So I'm still wedded to the Intel chip. And I do HATE the nasty, flat keyboard. Ugh.</p>— ben_marko (@BobfromCT) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/BobfromCT/status/1388627725166936070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-345068-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>The entry-level iMac has just a pair of Thunderbolt ports, while the higher models have an additional two USB 3 ports and gigabit ethernet on the power adapter. That’s a far cry from the veritable bevy of expansion options on the older iMac, which includes six USB ports, ethernet, and an SDXC card slot. Many of you think that the next iMac will address these issues, so you opted to hold off for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Waiting for iMac Pro.</p>— Alain Paradis, 🚴🏻‍♂️ (@alainparadis) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/alainparadis/status/1388663194227511299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-345068-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Waiting for products to mature!</p>— Roger Owens (@rogerowens) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/rogerowens/status/1388668436130242561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-345068-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Waiting for 27 inch iMac</p>— David Bailey 🗣 (@heydavidbailey) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/heydavidbailey/status/1388627229479890944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-345068-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>And some of you wanted to see more from the processor.
