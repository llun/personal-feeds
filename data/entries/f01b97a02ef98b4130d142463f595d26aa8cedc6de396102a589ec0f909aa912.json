It's important to note that Apple's mixed reality headset is not its more long-rumored AR glasses, being dubbed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a> which is set to launch in 2025.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman said that Apple is aiming to announce a mixed-reality headset at an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/apple-headset-next-several-months/\">in-person event in the \"next several months.\"</a> While on the surface Kuo and <em>Bloomberg</em> are stating different timeframes for the rumored headset, they could be referencing entirely different products.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-ar-vr-headset-2022-launch/\">previously indicated</a> that Apple's first mixed reality headset will be a high-end, pricey, and \"niche\" device aimed primarily at developers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMuch like what the company did for its ongoing transition to Apple silicon, Apple may decide to showcase a development headset meant primarily for developers in order to give them time to prepare their apps, and games for the new mixed-reality experience before they are shipped to customers. Kuo, who says a headset would debut in 2022, is likely referring to a mainstream consumer product, instead of a headset meant for developers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple will be holding its Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 7 where it will announce updates to all of its operating systems, and although no reports have so far suggested it, new hardware announcements could make a debut as well.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/kuo-headset-on-track-for-next-year/\">Kuo: Apple Still on Track to Release Mixed Reality Headset Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-still-on-track-to-release-mixed-reality-headset-next-year.2292924/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tU2wuPzGOFM:yrLm47L54DQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tU2wuPzGOFM:yrLm47L54DQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/tU2wuPzGOFM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f01b97a02ef98b4130d142463f595d26aa8cedc6de396102a589ec0f909aa912","category":"Apple"}
