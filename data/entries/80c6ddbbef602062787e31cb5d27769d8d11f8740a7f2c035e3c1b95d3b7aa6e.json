From the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> description:\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>For use by MFi Licensees only. Use the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Certification Assistant to test discovery, connection, and other key requirements for accessories you develop that incorporate &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network technology.</blockquote>Based on screenshots of the app, product developers are able to test connectivity, sound power, NFC capabilities, firmware, Bluetooth connectivity, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/find-my-test-app-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1848\" height=\"1384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792727\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network Accessory Program was first introduced alongside iOS and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a>. It lets third-party products integrate with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, allowing them to be tracked right alongside Apple devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/find-my-test-app-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1848\" height=\"1384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-792728\" />\r\n<br/>\r\niOS 14.5 added a new \"Items\" tab to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, which is where any &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integrated device will be able to be tracked. This is also presumably where Apple's own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> will be able to be located when those launch, but for now, it may be aimed at third-party accessories.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSo far, there are few accessory makers that have released a product that works with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration. Belkin <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/belkin-magsafe-charger-find-my-earbuds/\">in January announced</a> the Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds, which have &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration and will be able to be tracked in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; is able to work with any device that has Bluetooth and integrates Apple's code through the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network Accessory Program, so it is not limited to item trackers and can be built into any Bluetooth product. Tile has been offering a similar program that allows accessories to integrate with the Tile ecosystem to be located through the Tile app.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/find-my-accessory-program-test-app/\">Apple&#039;s Third-Party Find My Accessory Program Gets Closer to Launch With New Test App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-third-party-find-my-accessory-program-gets-closer-to-launch-with-new-test-app.2290820/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FhIGbwozrvI:lm9hgBjVr4A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FhIGbwozrvI:lm9hgBjVr4A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FhIGbwozrvI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"80c6ddbbef602062787e31cb5d27769d8d11f8740a7f2c035e3c1b95d3b7aa6e","category":"Apple"}
