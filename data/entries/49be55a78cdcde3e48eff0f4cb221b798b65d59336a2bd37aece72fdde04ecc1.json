The host who created the Space has speaking privileges to talk to those who join, and can designate up to nine other speakers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile there's a maximum of 10 speakers allowed, there's no limit on the number of listeners who can join a given Space. Spaces has been available in a beta capacity on iOS and Android devices, and creating Spaces is limited to a select number of people who have been selected to beta test the feature in the iOS app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll iOS and Android users can join an existing Space that has been created by someone in the beta, it's just the creation process that's limited at the current time.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/twitter-spaces-chat-feature-april-launch/\">Twitter to Make &#039;Spaces&#039; Chat Feature Available to Everyone in April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-to-make-spaces-chat-feature-available-to-everyone-in-april.2287878/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=g5Cd5cEYVSk:LgRe4wsl4ag:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=g5Cd5cEYVSk:LgRe4wsl4ag:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/g5Cd5cEYVSk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"49be55a78cdcde3e48eff0f4cb221b798b65d59336a2bd37aece72fdde04ecc1","category":"Apple"}
