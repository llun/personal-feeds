It’s very daunting. The absence of an U23 category further adds to this steep learning curve, and for so many it’s an unrealistic path.</p>\n<p>‘Ideally we want to provide the girls with opportunities that enable them to develop in a nurturing environment.</p>\n<p>‘It was important to me to spearhead the initiative, as it gave me a chance to put back some of my experience of joining cycling at an older age and the hurdles that presents.’</p>\n<p><strong>Find the rest of <a href=\"/tags/zwift-womens-history-month\"><em>Cyclist's 31 Inspirational Women</em></a> here</strong></p>\n<p>Dame Sarah welcomes the recent developments in women’s professional cycling, but recognises there is still work to be done.</p>\n<p>‘At Women’s WorldTour level the development and improvement has been fantastic but there is still work to be done for the tiers below the top flight.</p>\n<p>‘The pandemic has probably pushed this gulf even wider given the stretch on resources. Many top flight teams are able to travel and deliver on the testing requirements of racing with the Covid bubbles, but for smaller teams on lower budgets it’s a lot harder.</p>\n<p>‘The lack of events taking place below the top flight is also a problem, and having no domestic racing has affected the lower tiers. The knock-on effect on that the professional level could be a smaller talent pool in years to come.’</p>\n<p>Looking back on her long career there are plenty of standout moments for Dame Sarah to choose from, but a few highlights stand out for her as particularly special.</p>\n<p>‘One of the most memorable races was my 95km solo breakaway on Stage 1 of the Tour of California in 2016, only to be caught just 3km from the finish! Then there are my solo breakaways to win in the London and Rio Games.</p>\n<p>‘There’s also my epic attempt at the National Championships to bridge to the breakaway group of Lizzie Deignan, Emma Pooley, Sharon Laws and Nikki Brammier in 2012.</p>\n<p>‘I feel so fortunate to have so many great memories to look back on.'</p>\n<p><strong>For more from Zwift this International Women's Month</strong>, <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5632488661&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">visit here</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/cyclists\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Cyclists</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"df6775e93c68adc2c225a9bf983d0dde62202bf43e62859f3dd391b9bab55916","category":"Cycling"}
