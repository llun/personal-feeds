But when you dive into what each delivers, you’ll find that there are very distinct differences between them that go much deeper than their price differences. Now that we've had a few months to use them all, here’s how the models stack up and which one you should buy.</p><h2 class=\"toc\">Design and display</h2>\n<p>Apple hasn’t strayed very far from the original 2015 square design, so you're not going to notice a huge difference between the three watches, even though the Series 3 is slightly smaller than the SE and Series 6:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Series 3 (38mm):</strong> 38.6 x 33.3mm x 11.4mm</li>\n<li><strong>Series 3 (42mm):</strong> 42.5 x 36.4 x 11.4mm</li>\n<li><strong>SE/Series 6 (40mm):</strong> 40 x 34 x 10.7mm</li>\n<li><strong>SE/Series 6 (44mm):</strong> 44 x 38 x 10.7mm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The SE and Series 6 are also slightly heavier than the SE by about 3 grams, but your wrist really won’t notice the difference. Apple has the best and most recognizable watch design in the smartwatch industry, so any of the three will look and feel great on your wrist.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3575413/apple-watch-series-3-vs-se-vs-series-6-display-size-features-sensors-performance-lte-colors-price.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"49225550b138875d79fd9c227204ec03bc312d7b37cb410e6e21c25f19915bd5","category":"Apple"}
