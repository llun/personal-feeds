I see that happening day by day, we have more shows, more storytellers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo date, Apple originals have received 352 award nominations and 98 wins. We have shows that have gotten significant buzz like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Defending Jacob, etc. We feel really good about where we are. We're not releasing subscriber numbers.</blockquote>It's likely that ‌Apple TV+‌ paid subscriber numbers are quite low as Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-extends-free-apple-tv-plus-trials/\">continually extended</a> its free trial offerings, and is also reimbursing those who do not have a free trial at this time. Apple is currently offering a free trial to those who purchased an Apple device <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-extends-free-apple-tv-plus-trials/\">until July 2021</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCook was also asked if Apple had plans to raise the prices of any of its services, and he said he had nothing to announce. \"We try to give customers a great value,\" he said.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/apple-tv-plus-subscribers-tim-cook/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook: We Feel 'Really Good About Where We Are' With Apple TV+</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-we-feel-really-good-about-where-we-are-with-apple-tv.2293784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uRY-46yZfFs:LGZCiJcbpAI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uRY-46yZfFs:LGZCiJcbpAI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/uRY-46yZfFs\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d86eea4aea23b1c29a17110dc7bef4d7a5a1f98f430ea719aad86bec26958edb","category":"Apple"}
