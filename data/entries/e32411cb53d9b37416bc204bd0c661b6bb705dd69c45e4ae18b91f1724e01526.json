Thankfully he held on this time, and in so doing became apparently only the second Gino to win a Giro stage after Bartali.</p>\n<p>With this win, and a stage win the previous day at the Tour de Hongrie, <a href=\"/tags/bahrain-victorious\">Bahrain Victorious</a> should at least now have silenced the jokes around the team's name, and finally lived up to it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile a group of four riders jumped out of the GC group late on as Egan Bernal's accelerations could only be followed by Dan Martin, Giulio Cicconi and Remco Evenepoel – who has quietly moved himself up into second place overall..</p>\n<p>Still ahead of him though is 22-year-old Valter, the first Hungarian to ever wear the <em>maglia rosa, </em>who jumped into contention <a href=\"/in-depth/9605/gallery-dombrowski-steals-the-win-on-a-drenched-stage-4-at-the-giro-ditalia\">on Stage 4</a> by finishing in a breakaway group that gained a minute over the main favourites.</p>\n<p>Here are Chris Auld's images from the day:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9614/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery#18\"><p><span>Image 19 of</span> 23</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/cauldphoto-giro2021-stage6-0583.jpg?itok=JWVw4wwk\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 19 of </span>23</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9614/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery\">Giro d'Italia 2021 Stage 6 Gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>14 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9614%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%206%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9614%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%206%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9614%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%206%20Gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9614%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9614/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-6-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 23</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/cauldphoto-giro2021-stage6-0717.jpg?itok=7hUa0_4X\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e32411cb53d9b37416bc204bd0c661b6bb705dd69c45e4ae18b91f1724e01526","category":"Cycling"}
