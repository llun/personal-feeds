Over the past year, nearly every Skype update has broken\ncompatibility with Call Recorder, requiring Ecamm to issue\nrepeated updates and even change how the app behaves so that it\nautomatically reinstalls itself after Skype kicks it out. It’s\nbeen ugly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Same boat for me. With the exception of unusual episodes recorded with my guest(s) in person, I’ve recorded every episode of The Talk Show using Call Recorder. It does one thing and does it well, and I love the option to record all Skype calls automatically. I live in perpetual fear of forgetting to record a show. If this really is the end of the line for Call Recorder, it goes into the Hall of Fame on retirement.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Call Recorder Calling It Quits’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/03/call-recorder\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d37d47baa7851fc7d8ee8f6e5b75c1556a9db9205f06afa7e1757907c7fd8da3","category":"Tech"}
