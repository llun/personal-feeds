So there’s that. <a href=\"https://t.co/g5mttxbkiZ\">pic.twitter.com/g5mttxbkiZ</a></p>— Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1381242390707642373?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nIn a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212247\">support document</a>, Apple said this bug with inaccurate battery health reporting does not reflect an issue with an iPhone's actual battery health, and the recalibration process should resolve the issue. Symptoms of the bug include unexpected battery drain or, in a small number of instances, reduced peak performance capability, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the battery health reporting system is recalibrating, users will see an \"Important Battery Message\" in Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery Health, but the displayed maximum capacity percentage will not change during recalibration. When the process is complete, the new percentage will appear and the message will be removed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a small number of instances, recalibration might not be successful and a new battery service message will appear. If this occurs, an Apple Authorized Service Provider can replace the battery free of charge to restore full performance and capacity, according to Apple, but the company ensures there is no safety risk posed to customers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niOS 14.5 has been in beta testing for over two months and could be released next week.
