[credit:\n                        Capcom                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>Since its 2004 launch on PlayStation 2, the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series has stomped in bold-yet-unsteady fashion—like one of its titular beasts—toward legitimacy in the West. I've always found that peculiar, because as a bullet-point list, <em>MH</em> sounds like the ultimate in hardcore Western gamer catnip: deliberate slow-and-powerful combat (<em>Dark Souls</em>); teaming up with friends for epic PvE battles to amass loot (<em>Diablo</em>); deliriously tough and crazy-looking monsters and insane weapon variety to match (<em>Borderlands</em>).</p>\n<p>But the series mostly thrived in Japan on PSP—in a nation much better poised to support \"local wireless co-op adventuring,\" one of the PSP's flagship features. (I'm not sure I ever saw four people in the States playing a PSP in public, let alone doing so in a closely huddled group.) It wasn't until the series landed on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2018 with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/monster-hunter-world/\"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a> that Capcom corrected some key series stumbles, mainly mid-mission loading times and truly working online multiplayer. As a result, uptake in the West exploded, and <em>MHW</em> became Capcom's biggest-selling video game of all time.</p>\n<p>These days, Western gamers are finally embracing a powerful, portable console in droves, and Capcom has responded in unbelievable fashion. Behold: <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, the series' best game yet and likely the tipping point for anyone who has yet to sharpen their blade on its whetstones.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751302#p3\">Read 36 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751302&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"31262fe31e8af843a210fd1d51d0c6e691d5cb7e50c17a00a6a51ebb83cb2afe","category":"Tech"}
