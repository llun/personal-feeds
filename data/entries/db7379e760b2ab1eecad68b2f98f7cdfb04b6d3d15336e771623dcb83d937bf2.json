That's roughly $70 off Sony's MSRP, about $45 off the average street price we've tracked online, and it's tied for the largest price drop we've seen from a reputable retailer. We've seen this deal a few times since the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/sony-wh1000xm4-noise-cancelling-headphones-announced/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">headphones launched last August</a>, including during the most recent <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/11/best-black-friday-deals-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set of Black Friday sales</a>.</p>\n<p>Clunky name aside, the WH-1000XM4 is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our recommend pick</a> for noise-canceling headphones for most people. The phones do a tremendous job of blocking outside noise, with a design that's comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time, a strong 30+ hours of battery life, USB-C charging, and multidevice pairing, among other useful features. In terms of audio quality, they have a more bass-focused, consumer-friendly sound by default, but Sony's convenient companion app includes an EQ tool that lets you create a more neutral sound if you'd like.</p>\n<p>Competitors like Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 (which are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3uIbNXv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also on sale today</a>) offer clearer call quality and the ability to adjust the strength of its noise cancellation, while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/apples-new-airpods-max-over-ear-headphones-cost-549/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple's AirPods Max</a> is one of the few wireless pairs that can approach the XM4 in terms of pure noise-canceling strength. Those are both strong choices, but for most people in search of a premium set of wireless headphones, we think Sony's pair has the best blend of comfort, features, performance, and, especially at this price, value.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750566#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750566&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db7379e760b2ab1eecad68b2f98f7cdfb04b6d3d15336e771623dcb83d937bf2","category":"Tech"}
