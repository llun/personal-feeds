Users can click on the side menu button and select the \"Edit the map\" option to get to the a \"Missing Road\" entry.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nChoosing the Missing Road option lets users add missing roads by drawing lines, which is an upgrade from the prior tool that was pin based. Users could drop a pin where there was an error, but the new road drawing tool allows for better accuracy.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn addition to drawing lines to add missing roads, the tool lets users rename roads, change the direction of a road, and realign or delete incorrect roads. There are also tools for informing Google about road closures with specific dates, reasons, and routes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle is vetting all contributed road updates before publishing them to maps. The new editing feature is rolling out over the coming months to more than 80 countries.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlong with new road editing tools, Google is adding a photos update option to Google Maps. In the coming weeks, Google plans to add a tool that will let users \"share experiences and highlights\" with their recent photos.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/google-photo-updates.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788425\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nPhoto updates can be added by going to the \"Updates\" tab when viewing a specific place in Google Maps and tapping the \"upload a photo update\" button. The tool will also display photos shared by others.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/\">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/google-maps-missing-road-tools/\">Google Maps Gaining Tools for Drawing Missing Roads, Sharing Photo Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-gaining-tools-for-drawing-missing-roads-sharing-photo-updates.2287992/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=l3zIkTyVHIc:d0FOMG6cSOY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=l3zIkTyVHIc:d0FOMG6cSOY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/l3zIkTyVHIc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82cd867012f376b8e21e0fb9aeb5d06b78909b8634331e9e99c5068a2cce1b24","category":"Apple"}
