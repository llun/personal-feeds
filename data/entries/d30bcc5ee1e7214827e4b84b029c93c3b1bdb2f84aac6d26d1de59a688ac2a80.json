Check out his words and photos below.<span id=\"more-206252\"></span></p>\n<p>This is my trusty Raleigh Serengeti. It was found on Facebook Marketplace for $50 CAD, which is also where I found most of the parts to build it. I&#8217;m not 100% certain what year it&#8217;s from but it originally had a complete Shimano Altus A20 build, which dates back to 1993. Apart from some paint scuffs and parts in need of some TLC, it was in great condition. This bike is the result of multiple years of building commuter bikes to get around the pothole-filled streets of Montreal, Canada. Fun fact: the handlebar bag (courtesy of @sinkholemontreal) strapped to the basket was the winning prize for a picture of the gnarliest potholes in Montreal.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206255\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m super stoked about this build for multiple reasons. First on the list is the frame. I love subtle grey to black fade across the frame and fork. It&#8217;s hardly noticeable until matched to the black mudguards for winter. It&#8217;s a great combo with the colorful Raleigh decals and shiny gold head badge. I regret not taking a picture of the latter. Another great thing was not having to cold set the frame for a 10-speed hub. The clearance allows for a set of Schwalbe Table Tops (2.25&#8243;) which I use all year long. Next summer, I&#8217;ll try some slicker Rene Herse Rat Trap Pass.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206257\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the 1&#215;10 mullet drivetrain made of scavenged parts from past projects. Initially, the rear derailleur was a medium cage Deore M6000 matching the shifter, but the 11-42 cassette was too much for it. A quick search online (Marketplace again) and I easily got ahold of a long cage XTR M986 derailleur in great condition for pennies. The 32t narrow-wide chainring by Blackspire (Made in Canada, eh) has held on to the chain beautifully, especially paired with the clutched derailleur for trail riding. The purple bolts came from an abandoned bike behind the bike shop where I used to work.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206256\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Lastly, the bullmoose handlebars are by far my favorite piece. They also came from a garbage bike, which makes me sound like Oscar from Sesame Street by now. Cleaned them with the good ol&#8217; tin-foil-and-dish-soap trick and they regained their shiny finish.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206253\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206254\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/Raleigh-Serengeti-7.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>I had a Wald 139 laying around and it was a perfect fit once I chopped the legs of the basket to the right length.
