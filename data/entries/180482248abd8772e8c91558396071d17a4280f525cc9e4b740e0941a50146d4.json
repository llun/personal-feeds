As of this writing, many of the offers have also been price-matched at Amazon, if you already pay for a Prime membership and would prefer to shop there.</p>\n<p>Among the standout offers here are Switch exclusives <em><a href=\"https://fave.co/3yvNGMr\" target=\"_blank\">Super Mario Odyssey</a> </em>and <a href=\"https://fave.co/3hjHi5l\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a> for $35 each. While these aren't the absolute lowest discounts we've seen in either game's case, discounts below $40 for first-party Switch games have been rare outside of Black Friday season. <em>Odyssey </em>remains <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/super-mario-odyssey-review-marios-densest-deepest-adventure-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">one of the better entries</a> in the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mario/\"><em>Mario</em></a> library, while <em>Three Houses </em>is a tense tactical RPG couched in a surprisingly layered (if deeply <em>anime</em>) political thriller. Note that GameStop says these two deals will only last through July 6, after which they'll bump back up to a more typical sale price for $40.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777682#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777682&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"180482248abd8772e8c91558396071d17a4280f525cc9e4b740e0941a50146d4","category":"Tech"}
