We’ve seen these types of fixes in other recent updates and can’t stress how important it is to update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Apple’s security update document states that it fixes a flaw where “Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Those are particularly scary words, especially when paired with this sentence: “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.”  Two phrases you never want to hear in a security update for a device you own are “arbitrary code execution” and “may have been actively exploited,” so it’s important that users update as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Major security fixes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222&amp;xcust=1-1-345223-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">security notes</a> outline the issue at hand in technical terms. The CVE-2021-30665 applies to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336&amp;xcust=1-1-345223-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iOS and iPadOS 14.5</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212335&amp;xcust=1-1-345223-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">macOS 11.3</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212339&amp;xcust=1-1-345223-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">watchOS 7.4</a>, while CVE-2021-30663 doesn’t apply to the Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>WebKit</strong></p><p>Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.</p><p>Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved state management.</p><p>CVE-2021-30665: yangkang (@dnpushme)&amp;zerokeeper&amp;bianliang of 360 ATA</p><p><strong>WebKit</strong></p><p>Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited.</p><p>Description: An integer overflow was addressed with improved input validation.</p><p>CVE-2021-30663: an anonymous researcher</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>App Tracking Transparency fix in iOS and iPadOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are the release notes for iOS and iPadOS 14.5.1</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>This update fixes an issue with App Tracking Transparency where some users who previously disabled Allow Apps to Request to Track in Settings may not receive prompts from apps after re-enabling it. This update also provides important security updates and is recommended for all users.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install the updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before updating, it’s a good idea to back up your data, just in case the update causes problems.
