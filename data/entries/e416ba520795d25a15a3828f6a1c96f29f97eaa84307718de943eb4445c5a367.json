However, after adjusting its techniques, TSMT has increased its production yield rates to over 95%.<blockquote>TSMT is the exclusive provider of SMT services for the recently launched 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌'s miniLED backlights and is expected to do the same for the two upcoming miniLED-backlit MacBook models, the sources said.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDue to issues with PCBs and adhesive materials, TSMT's yield rates for surface mounting for miniLED backlighting was not high enough originally, the sources noted. After changing PCB and adhesive material suppliers, TSMT has hiked yield rates to over 95% currently, the sources indicated.</blockquote>The redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are expected to feature next-generation Apple silicon chips, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">removal of the Touch Bar</a>, the return of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> magnetic power cable, and an overall <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">new design with an HDMI port and SD card slot</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nExcitement around these new MacBook Pro models, which will target high-end professional customers,  has been heightened ever since the reveal of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip in November. The next chip, possibly featuring M1X or M2 branding, can be expected to feature significantly faster performance and greatly improved energy efficiency.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/mini-led-production-for-new-macbook-pros/\">Mini-LED Display Production Improving for Redesigned MacBook Pro Models Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mini-led-display-production-improving-for-redesigned-macbook-pro-models-later-this-year.2294638/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kH6fcFauf64:tdgZn-sULsE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kH6fcFauf64:tdgZn-sULsE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kH6fcFauf64\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e416ba520795d25a15a3828f6a1c96f29f97eaa84307718de943eb4445c5a367","category":"Apple"}
