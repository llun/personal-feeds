Once it’s a tangible product, we’ll be sure to get one in to review and compare the systems.</p>\n<p>Speculation aside, the PSENS tube feels well-made but is unlike the butyl, stretchy material of a traditional tube. That’s thanks to its polyurethane construction making it less malleable in your hands.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyre pressure accuracy seemed good.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>The NFC chip sits opposite the valve stem and as the tube is inflated, it gets pushed against the tyre’s carcass.</p>\n<p>The proximity to the outside of the tyre means a smartphone’s NFC induction loop can activate the chip, which then transmits the tyre’s current pressure to the Tubolito app.</p>\n<p>I found the success rate of connecting to the NFC chip so far to be about 75 per cent with a DH-casing 2.6in wide tyre. I suspect thinner casing tyres or ones with a less blocky tread will suffer from fewer connection failures.</p>\n<p>The PSENS tips the scales at a paltry 84g for the 1.8–2.5×29in version. That’s lighter than a hearty amount of tubeless sealant and a valve stem, but until I can do some thorough testing I can’t comment on the tube’s puncture resistance.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a full review soon.</p>\n<ul><li>£41.99 / $49.90 / €44.90</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <div>\n        \n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Barkbusters MTB Handguards</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Barkbusters says its hand guards will protect your pinkies.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>More commonly seen on motorbikes, specifically enduro, motocross and supercross bikes, hand guards are designed to protect riders’ hands from flying roost launched off the back of the bike in front, or from branches and thorns as you’re riding along overgrown trails in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>Translated to mountain biking, the 219g a pair hand guards are an interesting prospect especially for people who live in areas with low-lying gorse bushes or other spiky flora.</p>\n<p>They’re made from an impact-resistant plastic and attach to a bar using a lightweight nylon and aluminium clamp.</p>\n<p>The guards use a single mounting point on the inboard side of the brake levers (closer to the stem) with an open-ended design.</p>\n<p>This means they’re not rated for impact protection, so don’t expect them to safeguard your fingers from getting crushed by a close encounter with a tree.</p>\n<p>Barkbusters doesn’t comment on how they’d stand up to an accidental impact, but we’d hope they’d offer at least some protection or at the very least not flex enough to squash your hands between the guard, the brake lever and the bar.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Barkbusters-MTB-handguards-3-6ca7ac3.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The looks are motocross-inspired.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Barkbusters-MTB-handguards-2-561668d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Would you dare run these at your local riding spot?</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Barkbusters-MTB-handguards-4-3479a20.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>They should be good at deflecting loose branches or protecting your hands from flying rocks.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Barkbusters-MTB-handguards-5-d0f38b1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The open-ended design does mean the hand guards aren’t impact-rated.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Alex Evans</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThere are other benefits beyond protecting your hands from – to use Barkbusters’ words – “debris”.\n<p>In colder environments, chilly wind can cut through gloves and make a rider’s hands uncomfortably cold.
