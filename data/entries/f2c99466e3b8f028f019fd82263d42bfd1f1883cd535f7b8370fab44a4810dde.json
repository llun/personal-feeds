Today, <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/02/mlb-the-show-21-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-day-one/\">Microsoft announced</a> even better news for Xbox-owning baseball fans: <em>MLB The Show 21</em> will be included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription the day it launches on April 20.\n<p>The move means that over 18 million Game Pass subscribers will have free access to the game on Xbox One and the Xbox Series X/S, or on Android phones <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-gets-free-xcloud-game-streaming-in-september/\">via xCloud streaming</a>. That creates a bit of an awkward situation for PlayStation owners, who will have to pay individually for a Sony San Diego-developed and Sony-published game that many Xbox subscribers will get for free.</p>\n<p>That's especially notable because Sony has its own subscription service, PlayStation Now, which is not getting <em>MLB The Show</em> on launch day (as of now, at least). Then again, PlayStation Now has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/sony-has-a-playstation-now-problem/\">famously struggled to compare to Game Pass' \"day one\" bluster</a> for a while now, especially when it comes to first-party software. Sony's recent <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/17/play-at-home-2021-update-10-free-games-to-download-this-spring/\">\"Play From Home\" initiative</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/playstation-5-event-499-with-a-disc-drive-399-without-on-nov-12/\">PlayStation Plus Collection</a> have opened up access to some Sony-published titles recently, but these, too, have revolved around dated software.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754022#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754022&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2c99466e3b8f028f019fd82263d42bfd1f1883cd535f7b8370fab44a4810dde","category":"Tech"}
