The updated earbuds will apparently come with a new case and feature shorter stems, broadly mirroring the design of the current ‌AirPods Pro‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLooking to 2022, Gurman said that the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ will feature updated motion sensors and have a focus on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/airpods-health-tracking-features/\">fitness tracking</a>.<blockquote>The ‌AirPods Pro‌ coming next year will be the first change to that product since October 2019 and will include updated motion sensors with a focus on fitness tracking, the people said, asking not to be named because the plans are private.</blockquote>Apple has apparently tested a smaller design that eliminates the stems on ‌AirPods Pro‌. This stemless design is expected to debut on new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/lebron-james-beats-studio-buds/\">Beats Studio Buds</a> that are rumored to launch next month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple purportedly originally planned to release the second-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ in 2021, but for reasons that are unclear, the launch has been pushed back to 2022.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, Apple is said to not currently be working on a second-generation of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> over-ear headphones, but it has discussed launching additional color options in the future.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">Gurman: AirPods Pro 2 With Fitness Tracking Coming in 2022, AirPods 3 With 'Pro' Design to Launch Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-airpods-pro-2-with-fitness-tracking-coming-in-2022-airpods-3-with-pro-design-to-launch-later-this-year.2298236/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j0uyiHtIL2g:2trtfm4yVpI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=j0uyiHtIL2g:2trtfm4yVpI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/j0uyiHtIL2g\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1267535b4da8c047e4df6502a31b5cdeec79bed5d836b51f99b1b481be14143a","category":"Apple"}
