But it wasn’t just the near-$90 billion in revenue, it was also how it navigated the quarter. With no new product launches, it managed to set records for nearly every product category. We analyzed how they did it, but honestly, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344773/apple-earnings-q2-2021-iphone-ipad-mac-services-wearables.html\">a lot of it is beyond explanation</a>.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2db23c70d619ae6c9177307c4029f8dce0a5a086f2ea6af88a8441c8d0405656","category":"Apple"}
