{"title":"So long latex | New Pirelli P Zero Race SL tubular tyres use thermoplastic polyurethane inner tube","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pirelli-p-zero-race-sl-tubular-tyres/","date":1619534608000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/P-ZERO-Race-Tub-SL-section-5c3adf6.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Pirelli has launched a new SL version of its P Zero Race tubular tyre, which uses a thermoplastic polyurethane <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\" target=\"_blank\">inner tube</a> in place of traditional butyl rubber or latex tubes.</p>\n<p>The P Zero Race tubular drops a claimed 10 per cent in weight from the previous pro-level tub and will be used at the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/giro-ditalia/\">Giro d’Italia</a> by Pirelli sponsored <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">WorldTour pro teams</a> Trek-Segafredo, Team BikeExchange and AG2R Citroën Team.</p>\n<p>Pirelli positions the new P Zero Race SL tubular as something of a labour of love, rather than a tyre that will be commercially significant, with few amateurs likely to use them. However, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tubeless-tyres-pro-peloton/\" target=\"_blank\">pro teams still wanting tubular tyres</a>, it sees enhancing its offering as a significant input to their success.</p>\n<p>The new P Zero Race SL tubular is claimed to have been in development for two years, including test riding at the 2020 UAE Tour and 2020 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>.</p>\n<p>Sewn into a 320 TPI corespun casing, the new tyre includes Aramid fibres for increased puncture protection and uses the same SmartEVO tread compound as found in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr-28mm-tyre-review/\">P Zero Race clincher tyre</a>.</p>\n<p>The new thermoplastic polyurethane inner tube, which replaces the traditional tubes usually sewn into tubular tyres, is claimed to be both lighter and more airtight than a latex tube, and is made of similar material to tubes from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lose-mass-and-money-with-tubolitos-high-tech-tubes/\">Tubolito</a> and Schwalbe’s new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-aerothan/\">Aerothan tubes</a>.</p>\n<p>At a claimed 275g each, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/pirelli/\">Pirelli</a> claims the new tyre is around 35g lighter than its previous generation P Zero Race tubular, shaving 70g off the weight of a pro bike and reducing rolling inertia – an incredibly small advantage for us mere mortals but, for those at the sharp end of competition, something that will be no doubt be welcomed.</p>\n<p>If you want to get your hands on a set of P Zero Race SL tubular tyres, Pirelli expects to have them on general sale later this year priced at £99.90 per tyre (international pricing TBC).</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ac17a992f22f03fe0dd23d5b86f1f18bcd83b395bc0bf030b91c5c6fdfaecff2","category":"Cycling"}
