That's $100 off its typical going rate and tied for the lowest price we've tracked. While this model only comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage, making it better suited for more casual usage, it's also equipped with Apple's new M1 silicon, which our review found to provide <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/apples-m1-macbook-air-has-that-apple-silicon-magic/\" target=\"_blank\">supremely impressive value</a> in terms of both speed and battery life. That's on top of the typically sturdy hardware we've come to expect from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/2019-16-inch-macbook-pro-review-bye-bye-butterfly/\" target=\"_blank\">non-butterfly-keyboard</a> MacBooks.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, our deals roundup has a <a href=\"https://fave.co/3ejQ9kO\" target=\"_blank\">rare $10 discount</a> on Sony's DualSense wireless controller for the PlayStation 5, good prices on wireless noise-canceling headphones and USB-C chargers we like, and much more.
