Each of these builders brought something special to the showcase and a few raised the bar considerably in various ways. There’s a lot to go over here so let’s get to it!<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Prova-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Prova-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Prova-26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.provacycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Prova Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/provacycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@ProvaCycles</a></p>\n<p>My jaw dropped so far when I saw this bike that it went all the way down to Melbourne, Australia where Prova Cycles is based. The new made in-house ENVE Integrated Road System – which is currently only available through framebuilders – made its debut at the Builder Round Up and Prova Cycles 3D printed a special headtube for complete integration. This detail has got to be one of the crowning achievements of the whole show and I can’t express how stunning this bike is in person…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Naked-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Naked-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Naked-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nakedbicycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Naked Bicycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nakedbicycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@NakedBicycles</a></p>\n<p>Long, slack, and low aren’t typical indicators when used to describe a gravel bike. Quadra Island, BC’s Naked Bicycles brought this slacked-out drop-bar bike that looks like it’d be a blast to ride on some forest roads. With elegant, classic lines in bent titanium and a classy anodizing job, the guys at Naked are clearly in it for the right reasons.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-44Bikes-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-44Bikes-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-44Bikes-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">44 Bikes</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/44bikes/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@44Bikes</a></p>\n<p>Speaking of long, slack, and low, this 44 Bikes Marauder is the flat bar, singlespeed kin to the Naked. Kris Henry’s operations in New Hampshire constantly and consistently churns out bikes that are as beautifully executed as they are fun to ride. This singlespeed 29er uses the <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/product/mountain-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE Mountain Fork</a> to complete this ultralight, sleek package.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Spooky-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Spooky-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Spooky-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wearespooky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spooky Cycle Works</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wearespooky/\" target=\"_blank\">@WeAreSpooky</a></p>\n<p>It’s been a while but let me just say #FuckYeahDesertTan to this made in Arizona Spooky Rovr gravel bike. Spooky does all this in-house, including the frame finish. The Rovr is made from 7005 Italian tempered aluminum, features an <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/product/adventure-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE Adventure fork</a>, and clears a 50mm tire with plenty of room to spare.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Retrotec-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Retrotec-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Retrotec-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ingliscycles.com/retrotec/\" target=\"_blank\">Retrotec Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/retrotecbikes/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@RetrotecBikes</a></p>\n<p>What happens when supply chain shortages cause delays in manufacturing and extensive backlogs of orders? This! Curtis Inglis from Retrotec really likes to support his California makers and all his personal bikes come built with <a href=\"http://www.whiteind.com/\" target=\"_blank\">White Industries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Components</a>, both of which are so backlogged with orders that they made Curtis a series of mix-matched components. What you get is a bright and loud build on an otherwise subtle and clean titanium Funduro frame.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Argonaut-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Argonaut-25.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Argonaut-28.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://argonautcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Argonaut Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/argonautcycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@ArgonautCycles</a></p>\n<p>In 1989, Air Jordan released the Tinker Hatfield-designed IV, forever changing the basketball sneaker game. These iconic shoes were re-issued in 2020 in their iconic Fire Red livery, inspiring this Argonaut Cycles RM3 road. This paint job knocked it out of the park… er… wrong sport. Oh and photographing the Jumpman was a pain, let me tell you!</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p>Check back tomorrow for Part 03 of our ENVE Builder Round Up coverage!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d6e9ecfe64c7a0bd52e62e0f44837be093ff8f0157696f2c4e08a1b70ce32754","category":"Cycling"}
