The country buys millions of them each year, providing the bread and butter for domestic automakers. But not everyone is well-served by the products on offer. Some might want a truck but are turned off by their <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/02/supersized-trucks-and-suvs-seem-here-to-stay-unlike-the-auto-show/\">ever-increasing size</a>, particularly hood heights that hide small pedestrians. Others are put off by the poor efficiency. Enter Ford. After blowing everyone's socks off with its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/heres-what-we-know-about-fords-electric-f-150-lightning-pickup/\">electric F-150 Lightning</a>, the Blue Oval is back with yet another truck, but this one's small, efficient, and cheapâ€”it's the new Ford Maverick.</p>\n<p>Unlike its bigger siblings, the Maverick uses a monocoque chassis construction rather than a body on frame. At just under 200 inches (5,072 mm) in length, it's significantly shorter than the (232-inch/5,885-mm) F-150, and smaller even than the Ranger. And that means a shorter and lower hood and, therefore, a smaller forward blind spot, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/the-hidden-dangers-of-big-trucks/\">which will be welcome news to pedestrians, cyclists, and road users with small cars</a>.</p>\n<p>Under that small hood, you'll find a hybrid powertrain that combines a 162 hp (120 kW), 155 lb-ft (210 Nm), 2.5 L four-cylinder gasoline engine (that operates on the more efficient Atkinson cycle) with a 126 hp (94 kW), 173 lb-ft (235 Nm) permanent magnet electric motor. Together, they provide 191 hp (142 kW) to the front wheels via a continuously variable transmission.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771304#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771304&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
