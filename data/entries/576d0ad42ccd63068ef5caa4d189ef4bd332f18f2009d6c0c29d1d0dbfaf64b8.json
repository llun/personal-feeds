Who better to know the worth of staying private than one of the co-creators of a search engine that changed the world, after all. But to those who know where to look—like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/sergey-brins-airship-will-use-worlds-biggest-mobile-hydrogen-fuel-cell/\">eagle-eyed journalist Mark Hughes</a>—some details about LTA's plans have made it out into the open. Hughes spotted <a href=\"https://www.ltaresearch.com/careers/hydrogen-program-manager/\">a rather revealing job opening</a> at the company for someone to manage a hydrogen fuel cell program.</p>\n<p>The really interesting part of the job posting shows up in the list of primary responsibilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Engineering hydrogen fuel cell propulsion system through configuration of 1.5MW airship propulsion system including H2 storage, fuel cells, H2O capture, batteries, stern drive, and smaller electric motors and gear trains and retrofit of 750KW fuel cell system on existing airship</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, you did read that correctly, LTA is indeed working on configuring a 1.5 MW fuel cell system. For context, the hydrogen fuel cell that powers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/the-2021-toyota-mirai-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car-has-more-luxury-less-ugly/\">the Toyota Mirai was just bumped from 113 kW</a> to 128 kW in November, making it ten times less powerful than the system sought by LTA. Even the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/toyotas-heavy-duty-fuel-cell-truck-project-moves-from-alpha-to-beta/\">500 kW class-8 tractor-trailers</a> that Toyota is testing as drayage trucks at the Ports of LA and Long Beach only use a pair of Mirai fuel cell systems to generate power, and the most powerful hydrogen fuel cell that has taken to the air so far is a 250 kW fuel cell in the ZeroAvia ZA-600, a 20-seat plane with a range of 500 miles (800 km).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746037#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746037&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
