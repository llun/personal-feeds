Lasers!</p>\n<p>What's more, 'Mensola is for the <em>discerning</em> cyclist looking for the strongest and most beautiful mounting solution for their computer. Mensola improves aerodynamics at the front of the bike while also de-cluttering the handlebars.'</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9635/silca-mensola-computer-mount-photos#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 19</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/silca_mensola_crop_391036-mensola-22-mounted-verticle-black-3884df-original-1620848800.jpg?itok=ALnXIa_1\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>19</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Method in the madness</h3>\n<p>According to Silca, 'traditional manufacturing constraints have made it impractical to make all of the sizes necessary to sell a mount that will work with all of the various stem faceplate geometries, so we have still clamps.'</p>\n<p>To solve this, the brand found a solution 'in the form of 3D printing, which gives us the ability to manufacture practically any geometry without limitations of tooling or raw material stock sizes'.</p>\n<p>Which, in fairness, sounds pretty cool and probably goes some way to explaining the price tag.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9635/silca-mensola-computer-mount-photos#6\"><p><span>Image 7 of</span> 19</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/silca_mensola_crop_391022-mensola-22-side-view-with-bolts-cbaa08-original-1620848741.jpg?itok=Xn7sBcqG\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 7 of </span>19</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Lighter but stronger</h3>\n<p>Further, the brand says that the 3D printing approach gives unlimited design options and allowed its engineers to make 'the strongest, most beautiful and functional mount ever seen'.</p>\n<p>Expanding outside of the cycling industry, structural design elements were borrowed from architectural and aerospace engineering – so says Silca – resulting in a 'stressed skin design with internal truss elements'.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/5405/blow-by-blow-inside-silca\">Blow by blow: inside Silca</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/5577/silca-grande-americano-seat-roll-review\">Silca Grande Americano Seat Roll review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/garmin/9104/garmin-edge-1030-plus-gps-bike-computer-review\">Garmin Edge 1030 Plus GPS bike computer review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/6361/wahoo-elemnt-roam-review-navigation-colour-screen-long-battery-life\">Wahoo Elemnt Roam long-term review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAs such, the mount a claimed 10-15% lighter than aluminum mounts manufactured by CNC techniques, while also being six to 12 times stronger than those same aluminum designs – according to the brand's own calculations.</p>\n<p>Each unit is printed in 6Al/4V titanium at the brand's Indianapolis facility and then matched with 6Al/4V Titanium hardware for mounting to rider's stem. The Mensola's weight ranges from 27g to 36g depending on a stem's bolt spacing or hard points of an integrated handlebar. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9635/silca-mensola-computer-mount-photos\">Silca Mensola computer mount photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>18 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9635%2Fsilca-mensola-computer-mount-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Silca%20Mensola%20computer%20mount%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9635%2Fsilca-mensola-computer-mount-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Silca%20Mensola%20computer%20mount%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9635%2Fsilca-mensola-computer-mount-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Silca%20Mensola%20computer%20mount%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9635%2Fsilca-mensola-computer-mount-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9635/silca-mensola-computer-mount-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 19</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/silca_mensola_crop_391039-mensola-22-mounted-right-black-04ac92-original-1620848800.jpg?itok=7uL8x0a9\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/accessories\">Accessories</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/gps-bike-computers\">GPS bike computers</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d1a0f592a6a06e4dd9ce926b422d874126a682a8a930e40edc6faa833464c107","category":"Cycling"}
