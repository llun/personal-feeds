There's a similar Passwords section that's been on iOS for some time now, so now there's one streamlined way to access your passwords across Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/passwords-monterey-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to now, passwords on Mac were accessible through the Preferences interface in Safari, but the System Preferences option is easier to find. As with the prior version of the feature, Safari will suggest passwords automatically and detect compromised passwords for you.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNew in Monterey is an option to import and export passwords, so you can move your logins between ‌iCloud‌ Keychain and other password management apps. ‌iCloud‌ Keychain does not have as many entry fields as some password managers, but it supports username, password, and website data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/importing-password-monterey.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also a built-in authenticator feature, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-built-in-password-authenticator/\">coming to iOS and iPadOS 15</a> too. For sites and apps that use codes for two-factor authentication, you can store those codes right in ‌iCloud‌ Keychain and have them autofilled when you log in.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/adding-password-monterey.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDirect authenticator support will allow <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Mac users to choose to use Apple's solution over third-party apps and software like Authy and Google Authenticator.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/two-factor-verification-monterey.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOther smaller changes include an ‌iCloud‌ Passwords extension for autofilling saved ‌iCloud‌ Passwords in the Edge browser, which is handy for Windows users who need cross platform password access in the browser, plus there's a new ‌iCloud‌ Passwords app included with ‌iCloud‌ for Windows.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌macOS Monterey‌ password changes are live now in the developer beta, with Apple planning to release a public beta in July before the software sees a public launch this fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/macos-monterey-password-updates/\">macOS Monterey Features Dedicated Password Section in System Preferences, Built-In Authenticator and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-monterey-features-dedicated-password-section-in-system-preferences-built-in-authenticator-and-more.2300511/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XbyXYsM68hM:sHt-hxvnOp4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XbyXYsM68hM:sHt-hxvnOp4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XbyXYsM68hM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9bdf70eca70f99aa4f4f442971bc92458a4396a2b79d5e327062c3a0f7e4298b","category":"Apple"}
