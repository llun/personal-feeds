That chip, codenamed Staten, will include the same number of computing cores as the ‌M1‌ but run faster. It will also see the number of graphics cores increase from seven or eight to nine or 10. Apple is also planning an update to the low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro with that same chip.</blockquote>Specfic details on what the ‌MacBook Air‌ redesign may include are scarce, but, Apple leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> says that the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/prosser-macbook-air-colors-similar-to-imac/\">MacBook Air may come in different colors</a>, much like the recently launched 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg/\">Bloomberg</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/next-macbook-air-faster-apple-silicon-chip/\">Next MacBook Air Will Feature Faster Apple Silicon Chip With Up to 10 Graphics Cores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-macbook-air-will-feature-faster-apple-silicon-chip-with-up-to-10-graphics-cores.2296646/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ii0o5114Aw8:SauNLGsdPeM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ii0o5114Aw8:SauNLGsdPeM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Ii0o5114Aw8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"313894336ea9973dc5f298c8aa42402888cd4d86a6276ad7e7c089bb2b2eb6d6","category":"Apple"}
