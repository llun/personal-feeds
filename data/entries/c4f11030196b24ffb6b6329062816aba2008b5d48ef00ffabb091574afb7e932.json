It comes in Easter egg blue, green, yellow,\npink, orange, purple and (thankfully) silver. If the colors\nweren’t bold enough, Apple added sorta faded complementary colors\nto the stand, which is an … interesting design choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I feel like this argument is from 1999 — <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3\">except in 1999</a>, there were <em>only</em> brightly-colored iMacs. There’s a neutral silver this time, which makes Goldman’s argument rather baffling unless he just wants to be known as Mr. No Fun.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/22/goldman-not-getting-a-gold-imac-i-presume\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c4f11030196b24ffb6b6329062816aba2008b5d48ef00ffabb091574afb7e932","category":"Tech"}
