Is it some kind of arcane knowledge, handed down only to initiates after grueling initiations? Well, no. Actually, anyone can learn about Terminal commands, if they know where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to use the commands manual</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to Terminal wisdom is the <code><strong>man</strong></code> command. It summons manual (or <em>man</em>) pages for almost any command; they’re the equivalent of a help system for the command line. In fact, <code><strong>man</strong></code> itself is a command, whose role is to format and display this documentation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, launch Terminal (in your /Applications/Utilities folder). Then, if you type <code><strong>man pwd</strong></code>, for example, Terminal will display the man page for the <code><strong>pwd</strong></code> command. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/07/man-pwd-100046811-large.png\" /><figcaption>The beginning of the <code>man</code> page for the <code>pwd</code> command.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>All <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages have a common format. They begin with <em>name</em> (the name of the command) and a brief description of what it does. The <code><strong>pwd</strong></code> command I looked at above shows the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong> <code>pwd -- return working directory name </code> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next comes <em>synopsis</em>, which shows the command options, or flags, that you can use with it. For <code><strong>pwd</strong></code>, there are two options: <code>-<strong>L</strong></code> and <code><strong>-P</strong></code>. These options are explained in the <em>description</em> section: </p>\n\n\n\n<pre><strong>DESCRIPTION\nThe pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard output.\n\nSome shells may provide a builtin pwd command which is similar or  identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\nThe options are as follows:\n\n-L      Display the logical current working directory.\n-P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic links resolved).\n\nIf no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.</strong></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see here, each of the two options is explained, and a final sentence tells you that the command assumes that the <code><strong>-L</strong></code> option is desired if no other option (and there’s only one) is specified. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you work from the command line, you’ll find that reading up on the options available for different commands is really important. You’ll learn the myriad ways you can use these tools, and some <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages also contain examples to help you understand them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to scroll through man pages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you look at a <code><strong>man</strong></code> page, you do so in Terminal through another command, called a <em>pager</em>; by default, this is the <code><strong>less</strong></code> command. What a pager command does is allow you to view content in Terminal page by page, or line by line. When you’re viewing a <code><strong>man</strong></code> page, you will most often not see the entire page at once. You’ll need to page down to see more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to do this with <code><strong>less</strong></code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you press Return, the page will move down one line.</li><li>If you press the spacebar, the page will scroll one page (the number of lines visible in your Terminal window).</li><li>You can tell that there’s more to come by the <code><strong>:</strong></code> (colon) visible at the bottom of the window. </li></ul><p>Try it on your Mac: Open Terminal, type <code><strong>man ls</strong></code>, then press Return. The <code><strong>ls</strong></code> command’s <code><strong>man</strong></code> page is quite long, and you’ll need to press the spacebar several times to get to the bottom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, when you’re viewing a <code><strong>man</strong></code> page, you need to go back up and look at something that’s no longer visible. Depending on your Terminal settings, you may be able to scroll the Terminal window. If not, press Control-B to go back a page, and the spacebar, or Control-F, to go forward a page. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get to the end of a <code><strong>man</strong></code> page, you’ll see this: <code><strong>(END)</strong></code>. You’ll notice that you can’t do anything at that point; you need to quit the <code><strong>less</strong></code> command; do this by pressing the <code>Q</code> key. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other ways to read man pages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> If you don’t want to read <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages in Terminal, there are other ways to view this content. You can find <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages on the web. Just type <code><strong>man</strong></code> and the name of a command into your favorite search engine, and you’ll get plenty of hits. Apple has a documentation repository with <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/reading_unix_manual_pages/&amp;xcust=1-1-221483-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>. You can click Alphabetic Index to get a list of all commands, then search for the one you want. Apple’s <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages are useful because a popup menu near the top of the page lets you choose an OS X version, so if you need to see the <code><strong>man</strong></code> page for an older version of OS X, you can do so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> No matter which route you choose, <code><strong>man</strong></code> pages open the door to a goldmine of information about the command line. Use them and you’ll learn all the ins and outs of the commands you use. </p>\n</div>","author":"Kirk McElhearn","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"50695d220d031840ace12f7ec57118d852acbe185e64cd5a8f2bd66cbda14595","category":"Apple"}
