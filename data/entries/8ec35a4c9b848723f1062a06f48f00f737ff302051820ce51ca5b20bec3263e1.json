NASA has not sent a robotic spacecraft to Venus since the launch of the Magellan orbiter in 1989. Launched by space shuttle <em>Atlantis</em>, Magellan made a controlled entry into the Venusian atmosphere in 1994 after collecting reams of data that have tantalized scientists ever since.</p>\n<p>\"The Venus community is absolutely elated and excited and wants to just get to work and see this happen,\" said Venus researcher Ellen Stofan, theÂ Smithsonian Under Secretary for Science and Research, in an interview. \"We all are so hungry for data, for moving the science forward. A lot of us worked in this field since Magellan. We've had these really fundamental science questions for so long.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769277#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769277&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ec35a4c9b848723f1062a06f48f00f737ff302051820ce51ca5b20bec3263e1","category":"Tech"}
