Facebook is hoping that people will use the watch in the same ways that smartphones are used now to circumvent Apple and Google's control over mobile Facebook users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrior rumors about the smart watch suggested it will feature a cellular connection that does not require a smartphone, and wearers will be able to send messages with Facebook services like Messenger and WhatsApp. It's also expected to have built-in health tracking features like a heart rate monitor, and it will run a custom version of Android.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere have been rumors that Apple might one day add a camera to the Apple Watch, but it so far has yet to happen. Given Facebook's poor track record when it comes to data collection and privacy, people may be hesitant to use a Facebook-designed smart watch, especially one equipped with multiple cameras and a microphone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFuture iterations of the Facebook smart watch will serve as a key input device for augmented reality glasses that Facebook also has in the works. Facebook is aiming to launch its new smart watch next summer, and it could be priced at around $400.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/facebook-smart-watch-two-cameras/\">Facebook Working on Smart Watch With Detachable Display and Two Built-In Cameras</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-working-on-smart-watch-with-detachable-display-and-two-built-in-cameras.2300136/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V02ucdDeZC4:Ey2QoBGamcc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V02ucdDeZC4:Ey2QoBGamcc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/V02ucdDeZC4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8248a7089fdeb0750abb7fcef6df741ea6d87852e04c3a5e7e6bf41cb68a65c0","category":"Apple"}
