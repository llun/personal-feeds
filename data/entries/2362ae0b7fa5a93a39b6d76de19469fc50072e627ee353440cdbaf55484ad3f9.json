The set offers two audio options: uncompressed stereo and DTS-HD 5.1 surround sound.</p>\n<p>There's one thing genre cinephiles might be hoping for that they won't get here, though: commentary from filmmaker David Lynch, who directed the film and became famous for later works like <em>Twin Peaks</em> and <em>Blue Velvet</em>. Those familiar with the film's history won't be surprised by that omission though; Lynch disowned <em>Dune</em> when it was released, saying that it did not represent his creative vision due to interference from the studio.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768988#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768988&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2362ae0b7fa5a93a39b6d76de19469fc50072e627ee353440cdbaf55484ad3f9","category":"Tech"}
