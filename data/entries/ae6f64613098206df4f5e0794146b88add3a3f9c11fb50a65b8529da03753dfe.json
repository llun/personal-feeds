In Kuo's latest investor note, seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, the analyst underlines his belief that even when the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; transitions to an OLED display in 2022, mini-LED will remain in its tablet lineup as a display technology exclusive to &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>The market is worried that if the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> starts to use OLED in 2022, Apple will abandon the mini LED. However, according to our latest industry survey, if the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; adopts an OLED display in 2022, it will be the mid-/low-end &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, while the high-end &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will still use a mini LED display. The adoption of OLED in &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; does not affect the positive trend of mini LED. Since the OLED used in &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is a rigid type and has a significantly lower PPI than <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, it is less challenging to produce, and the cost is close to the LCD currently used in &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.</blockquote>Kuo envisions a future &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup in which OLED and mini-LED further differentiate Apple's mid-to-low end &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models from its &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; devices. Apple currently uses OLED displays in the Apple Watch and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, while Macs and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; still retain the older LCD technology. OLED displays offer higher brightness, deeper blacks, and wider viewing angles. However, they often cost significantly more to produce than LCDs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEarlier this month, <em>DigiTimes</em> reported that a 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, presumably the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, will be updated with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/10-9-inch-oled-ipad-early-2022/\">OLED display in early 2022</a>. In contrast to Kuo's note, <em>DigiTimes</em> stated that Apple would also adopt OLED technology for the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <em>DigiTimes</em> has also claimed that Apple might release 16-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro with OLED later on next year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is already working on several products with mini-LED displays, including redesigned MacBook Pros. Kuo believes that Apple's use of mini-LED will accelerate in the coming years as production costs decrease, with Apple's mid-to-high-end devices consistently adopting the technology first. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-oled-ipad-air-in-2022/\">Kuo: iPad Air to Adopt OLED in 2022, Mini-LED to Remain Exclusive to iPad Pro Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-ipad-air-to-adopt-oled-in-2022-mini-led-to-remain-exclusive-to-ipad-pro-models.2288725/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zjl6RhOrfyA:Z2TWVNuoKNE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zjl6RhOrfyA:Z2TWVNuoKNE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zjl6RhOrfyA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae6f64613098206df4f5e0794146b88add3a3f9c11fb50a65b8529da03753dfe","category":"Apple"}
