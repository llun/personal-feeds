It \"lays the foundations that enable us to prepare the future beyond Ariane 6 and Vega-C,\" he said. \"These system concept studies will include services that prioritize the future needs of Europe’s space programs but also allow us to address global market needs.\"</p>\n\n<p>The implication is that Europe's next generation of rockets, the larger Ariane 6 booster and smaller Vega-C, will meet the continent's launch needs for the next decade. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/07/as-the-spacex-steamroller-surges-european-rocket-industry-vows-to-resist/\">Both of these new rockets</a>, which are evolved from an earlier generation of boosters, are due to make their debut within the next 12 to 18 months.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751120#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751120&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f943818593c8e70c04669233c77615956ad3123501a7d4adab9133b95a9934a2","category":"Tech"}
