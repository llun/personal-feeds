A word of warning though: Don't install these betas on a primary device, or at least make sure to have a backup, as there can be significant bugs and usability issues.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Latest iPhone 13 Dummies Again Show New Diagonal Dual-Lens Camera Arrangement Coming to Standard Model</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIt's a rite of passage as we get closer to the introduction of new iPhone models: We've moved beyond the leaks and design drawings to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/29/iphone-13-dual-lens-diagonal-array/\">full-fledged dummy units</a> that show off what we expect to see from the iPhone 13.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iphone-13-duan-rui1.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple is currently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/apple-preps-for-iphone-13-production/\">preparing to ramp up production</a> of the upcoming iPhone models, lining up suppliers to start <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/apple-preps-for-iphone-13-production/\">delivering components in mass quantities</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>DigiTimes: Apple to Announce Redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in September</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nMany Apple fans were disappointed at the lack of an announcement about redesigned MacBook Pro models at WWDC last month, but we won't have too much longer to wait if a new report is accurate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-render.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTaiwanese site <em>DigiTimes</em> says the new models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-macbook-pro-in-september/\">will be announced in September</a>, although October might be more likely as Apple prefers to separate its iPhone and Mac announcements and the new iPhones are expected to return to their normal September launch timing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Kuo: AirPods Pro 2 to Launch Next Year, AirPods Shipments to Exceed 100 Million</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWe've been hearing rumors about updated AirPods models for some time, and the most recent claims are continuing to hint at timing for these releases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/AirPods-Pro-Gen-3-Mock-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNoted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/kuo-airpods-pro-2-next-year/\">second-generation AirPods Pro are expected to launch next year</a>, with previous reports suggesting they will arrive in the first half of the year. Another recent rumor says unspecified <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/29/new-airpods-and-macbooks-due-to-launch-later-this-year/\">AirPods should launch later this year</a>, which lines up with what we've been hearing for the third generation of the regular AirPods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Shares List of Products to Keep Safe Distance Away From Pacemakers</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nSince the launch of MagSafe alongside the iPhone 12 last year, some health experts have been warning about the potential risks of bringing products containing magnets close to pacemakers and other medical devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafecasedangle.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn response, Apple has updated a support document with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/26/apple-lists-products-to-keep-away-from-pacemakers/\">long list of Apple products that should be kept away from medical devices</a> to avoid potential interference.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Redesigned Apple Watch Series 7 Could Prioritize Longer Battery Life Over Additional Sensors</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 coming later this year is expected to feature a redesign with flat edges and display improvements, but one thing that's been up in the air is whether we'll see any new health-related sensors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-Watch-7-Unreleased-Feature-Red.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been working on sensors for metrics like blood glucose, but a new report says the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/apple-watch-series-7-improved-battery-life/\">Series 7 will prioritize battery life improvements</a> rather than trying to pack more sensors into the watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jul-1-2021\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/03/top-stories-ios-15-macos-monterey-public-betas/\">Top Stories: iOS 15 and macOS Monterey Public Betas, iPhone 13 and MacBook Pro Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-15-and-macos-monterey-public-betas-iphone-13-and-macbook-pro-rumors-and-more.2303106/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BarwOgfZ-tk:DvBAHIMDLGw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BarwOgfZ-tk:DvBAHIMDLGw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BarwOgfZ-tk\" />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"646e3966f350cb38e4f6a07b519c50a318a15024525de775eed733f7a180e352","category":"Apple"}
