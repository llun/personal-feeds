James appears to be wearing the Beats Studio Buds in white, based on the shape and design of the earbuds in his ears.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/beats-studio-buds-1-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's difficult to get a good look at the Beats Studio Buds worn by James, but we've already seen several closer views of the upcoming earbuds. The wire-free in-ear Beats-branded earbuds <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/\">were first spotted by <em>MacRumors</em></a> in the tvOS 14.6 and iOS 14.6 betas earlier this month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/beats-studio-buds-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beats Studio Buds are easy to identify at a glance because they're unlike any prior Beats headphones that Apple has released to date, as there is no ear wrap as with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/\">Powerbeats Pro</a>. Compared to other Beats-branded headphones, the Beats Studio Buds are tiny in design and look similar to in-ear earbuds from companies like Samsung and Google, but with a distinctly Beats-like look and feel.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Beats-Studio-Buds-feature-3.75.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple plans to offer the Beats Studio Buds in red, black, and white, with a matching oval-shaped charging case available with the headphones. As with the â€ŒPowerbeats Proâ€Œ, the Beats Studio Pro feature silicone ear tips that fit into the ears.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Animations of Beats Studio Buds: ðŸ§µ <a href=\"https://t.co/XYVvYP7ez3\">pic.twitter.com/XYVvYP7ez3</a></p>â€” Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1394361761571254272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 17, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to spotting the Beats Studio Buds in iOS 14.6, we've also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/beats-studio-buds-show-up-in-fcc-database/\">seen them in FCC filings</a> and earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/beats-studio-buds-leaked-images/\">images of the casing</a> leaked, giving us a clearer picture of the design.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/beats-studio-buds-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBeats Studio Buds are particularly interesting in light of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-2/\">AirPods Pro 2 rumors</a>. Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2 could feature a similar design, with rumors suggesting the updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> will have a rounded, compact design that's stemless, a description that sounds a lot like the new Beats.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's no word yet on when the Beats Studio Buds might be launching, but since they've already received FCC approval, we could be seeing them in the near future.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/lebron-james-beats-studio-buds/\">LeBron James Spotted Wearing Unreleased Beats Studio Buds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lebron-james-spotted-wearing-unreleased-beats-studio-buds.2297982/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aH5QJBJJcq8:hhtm_EQQpDM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aH5QJBJJcq8:hhtm_EQQpDM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/aH5QJBJJcq8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b2070008a6f59280015f036ec1220e821372bf3f10e0ac47ceacd9b448abae63","category":"Apple"}
