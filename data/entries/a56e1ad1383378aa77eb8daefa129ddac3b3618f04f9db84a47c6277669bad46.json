According to Article 11.3.1 of the UCI&#8217;s AntiDoping Rules, a team with two anti-doping rules violations in a 12-month period &#8220;shall, unless circumstances of exceptional nature require otherwise&#8221; receive a suspension of between 15 and 45 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI said in a statement that it &#8220;will shortly refer the matter to the Disciplinary Commission which will render a decision in due course.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the length of a suspension and timing of when it is handed down, Vini Zabù could miss the Giro d&#8217;Italia, which starts on May 8. Vini Zabù was one of three squads receiving wildcard invites to the race this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time that the Giro d&#8217;Italia <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/giro-announces-wildcard-selections-androni-and-arkea-left-out/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">team selection was announced</a>, Gianni Savio, manager of the Androni Giocattoli-Sidermec team that did not receive an invite, criticized the selection of Vini Zabù after Spreafico&#8217;s doping positives during last year&#8217;s race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can’t explain it, I don’t find a logic in all this,” Savio told la Repubblica in February. “If they had invited Quintana’s Arkea I would have been able to understand, nothing to say. The Zabù, on the other hand, no, I don’t like it. With everything they’ve done lately.”</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/vini-zabu-faces-a-potential-suspension-after-another-doping-positive/\">Vini Zabù faces a potential suspension after another doping positive</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a56e1ad1383378aa77eb8daefa129ddac3b3618f04f9db84a47c6277669bad46","category":"Cycling"}
