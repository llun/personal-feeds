{"title":"The Media’s Lab Leak Fiasco","link":"https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-medias-lab-leak-fiasco","date":1622138093000,"content":"\n<p>Great column today from Matt Yglesias:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because there is obviously a big media fuckup angle to this story,\nthe two biggest deal accounts for a lot of media-skeptics are\n<a href=\"https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-lab-leak-theory-f4f88446b04d\">Donald McNeil making the case for a lab\nleak</a>and\n<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/wade-on-the-lab-leak-theory-of-covid/\">Nicholas Wade making the case for a lab\nleak</a>\nbecause those are both veteran science reporters who got\n“cancelled.” But I do think it’s important to try to understand\nexactly who got what wrong here. My best assessment is to agree\nwith Josh Rogin that this is a case of a smallish group of\nreporters and fact-checkers proclaiming a scientific consensus\nwhere none ever really existed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshrogin/status/1376206303295643648\">Josh Rogin (28 March\n2021)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To anyone saying there is a “scientific consensus” about the\norigin of the coronavirus — Robert Redfield is a scientist. There\nis no consensus. Stop writing that falsehood into your stories,\nplease.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a question as to why that fake consensus emerged. But I\nthink the more troubling question is: How did people let the\noriginal story of what Tom Cotton even said go so badly awry?\nEssentially Cotton said something that was then transformed into a\nfake claim of a Chinese bio-attack, then the fake claim was\ndebunked, and then the debunking was applied to the real claim\nwith little attention paid to ongoing disagreement among\nresearchers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At a meta level, it is fascinating to watch the top news publications unwind themselves from last year’s mistake of lumping “accidental leak from well-intentioned Wuhan research lab” with the actual baseless conspiracies about bioweapons or the SARS-CoV-2 virus being “engineered” from scratch to destabilize the world economy or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/25/timeline-how-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-suddenly-became-credible/\">an unwinding from the Washington Post</a> two days ago; here’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/briefing/lab-leak-theory-covid-origins.html\">the New York Times’s unwinding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/27/media/covid-19-origins-lab-leak-media/index.html\">CNN’s</a> today. The Post’s headline is instructively defensive: “Timeline: How the Wuhan Lab-Leak Theory Suddenly Became Credible” — the theory has been credible and compelling all along. What’s “sudden” is that journalists are now realizing — as Yglesias says — that they fucked up last year establishing a baseline conventional wisdom that it was pure crackpottery.</p>\n\n<p>Yglesias’s piece is a terrific summary of the whole debacle.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/27/media-lab-leak-fiasco\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9c4099afed7e77661655890e050b6842c175031bd0564bbeb5fbd7e8e8e328bd","category":"Tech"}
