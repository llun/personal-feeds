Once the profile is in place, the watchOS 7.4 beta can be downloaded through the dedicated ‌Apple Watch‌ app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> by going to General > Software Update.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTo update to the new software, the ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlongside iOS 14.5, watchOS 7.4 introduces a new \"Unlock with Apple Watch\" feature that lets an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Face ID use an unlocked and authenticated Apple Watch as a secondary authentication measure when you're wearing a mask, alleviating the need to enter a passcode to unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iphone-apple-watch-unlock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1140\" height=\"847\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781387\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nFace ID does not work when wearing a mask, but this new Apple Watch feature provides an easy but still secure way to access the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without the hassle of a passcode. It's similar to the Apple Watch unlocking on Mac and can be enabled in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAn unlocked Apple Watch paired with Face ID can unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when a mask is worn, but it's only for mask usage. The Apple Watch cannot be used to authenticate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases, nor can it be used to unlock apps that require a Face ID scan. In these situations, the mask will need to be removed or a passcode/password will need to be used instead.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iphone-apple-watch-unlock-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1484\" height=\"1143\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781386\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen the Apple Watch unlocks the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you'll feel a haptic tap on the wrist and will receive a notification on the watch, similar to how it works when using the watch to unlock a Mac.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor those who use Apple Fitness+, the watchOS 7.4 update combined with iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 enables <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> 2 for Apple Fitness+, so workouts can be streamed to an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; 2-enabled TV or set-top box. Apple Watch metrics do not show up on the screen when AirPlayed, however, and that feature is limited to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;/<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>/<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has said that watchOS 7.4 will be released in the early spring, with spring set to start on March 20, so there are still a few weeks of beta testing expected.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-seeds-watchos-7-4-beta-4-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of watchOS 7.4 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-watchos-7-4-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2288391/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wCJ_NyUXP3s:VXWRDasgZ5Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wCJ_NyUXP3s:VXWRDasgZ5Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wCJ_NyUXP3s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29832c4f72cdd877be2b0542c91907ae7399a60729cd27fba13da59fa03964c9","category":"Apple"}
