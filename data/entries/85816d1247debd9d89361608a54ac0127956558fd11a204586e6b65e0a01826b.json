For the most part, this works pretty seamlessly—but in some cases, missing tracking scripts can interfere with a page's rendering, either delaying it (as seen in the animated image above, on the left) or permanently breaking it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection\">Smart Block</a> takes an additional step to improve the rendering on pages that embed third-party trackers—instead of just pulling the script and leaving a \"hole\" where it used to be, Smart Block replaces it with what Mozilla describes as \"stand-in\" scripts. These stand-in scripts function just enough like the original trackers to restore the intended page-rendering sequence and results without actually leaking data to third parties.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751519#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751519&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85816d1247debd9d89361608a54ac0127956558fd11a204586e6b65e0a01826b","category":"Tech"}
