Matt’s <a href=\"https://www.whycycles.com/our-bikes/el-jefe/\" target=\"_blank\">El Jefe</a> build was one of the last bikes I shot on the trip but had such a wild build kit that I wanted to reserve it for its own gallery, so let’s check it out in detail below.<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Matt works in Dealer Sales and acquired this El Jefe when they came out earlier this year. The current build state is what he had in his parts bin and is working towards a more <em>deep custom</em> build kit for it. Eventually, a titanium Squid fork will accompany the build, along with EE Wings cranks, new wheels with Onyx hubs, ti bars, and other notable accouterments. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Right now though, it’s hard to argue with this bike’s capability to steez ratio. The <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/2018-colors/limited-edition-30th-anniversary-box-set/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering 30th anniversary box set</a> parts puts it over the edge with the pink cable housing, <a href=\"https://www.revelbikes.com/our-bikes/revel-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Revel wheels</a> with <a href=\"https://industrynine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Nine</a> hubs, <a href=\"https://endlessbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Endless Bike Co</a> SS cogs (18t), <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/products/atlas-crankset\" target=\"_blank\">Race Face Atlas cranks</a> (34t), a shiny <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/rockshox/series/sid\" target=\"_blank\">Sid</a> fork, and that prototype Why titanium seatpost. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-25.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The El Jefe, once it’s back in stock, is going to be one of the best sellers in Why’s catalog, ATMO. There’s something amazing about a titanium hardtail that just elevates the riding experience, and having a bike that can easily be converted to singlespeed just ups the ante even more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-32.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/Matts-Why-Cycles-El-Jefe-SS-29er-with-Paul-Components-30th-Anniversary-Bits-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re wondering about Matt’s bandage, he took a spill rafting and a rock gave him a pretty good gash that merited 8 stitches. As for his socks and Birks, well… that’s a point of contention at the Why and Revel offices!</p>\n<p>Thanks again to <a href=\"https://www.whycycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Why</a> and <a href=\"https://www.revelbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Revel</a> for letting me pine over their bikes and kick around for the weekend. That whole team knows how to live it up!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"387bc08722608315343bf1617331a8ad1b63e393278deba6ec5b6ce8e2877a7f","category":"Cycling"}
