Windows support will be added in a future update.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that Boundary 0.2 will be the first time many users evaluate Boundary since its 0.1 launch, it’s worth calling out some of the new capabilities that have been delivered since 0.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Worker tags and filters</strong>: Enable target traffic to be effectively “tied” to a given set of workers with <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/boundary-0-1-5\">worker tags</a>, forcing the session to occur through specified workers for a specific target.</li>\n<li><strong>Boundary upgrades and database migrations</strong>: Boundary provides an <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/upgrade-version\">easy upgrade path</a> with fail-safes in the event of migration issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Resource filtering and listing improvements</strong>: Boundary users can navigate their resources more easily by <a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/concepts/filtering/resource-listing\">filtering list actions</a> based on resource information.</li>\n<li><strong>Improvements for Kubernetes access</strong>,<code>boundary connect kube</code>: Run Boundary on Kubernetes and/or use Boundary to <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/gating-access-to-kubernetes-with-hashicorp-boundary\">manage access</a> to your Kubernetes APIs and kube services.</li>\n<li><strong>Boundary reference architectures</strong>: Learn how to deploy Boundary with reference architectures for popular platforms, including <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/kube\">Kubernetes</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/aws\">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/azure\">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/gcp\">Google Cloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture/tree/main/deployment/docker\">Docker</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Boundary 0.2 also includes many additional minor features, improvements, and bug fixes. The <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">Boundary changelog</a> provides a full list of all changes.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#oidc-authentication-method\">»</a><a></a>OIDC Authentication Method</h2>\n<p>One of the community’s biggest asks since Boundary’s launch is the ability for users to leverage external identity providers (IDPs) to log into Boundary. Boundary 0.2 adds support  for OIDC authentication methods, which allow users to delegate authentication to an OIDC provider. This feature enables Boundary to integrate with popular identity providers like Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Okta, cloud identity management systems such as AWS IAM, and others.</p><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1618430448-boundary-oidc-1.png\" /><p>In this release, users can create, read, update, and delete a new OIDC authentication method resource and then use it to login via the CLI, Boundary Desktop, or the Boundary Admin Console. OIDC auth method configuration is initially available via the command line, and in upcoming releases we’ll also be integrating OIDC configuration into Boundary’s Terraform Provider as well as the Boundary administration console..</p>\n<p>To get started with creating OIDC auth methods to log into Boundary with common OIDC providers, check out the new Boundary <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/boundary/oidc-auth?in=boundary/manage-deployment\">OIDC learn tutorial</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#desktop-client-ga\">»</a><a></a>Desktop Client GA</h2>\n<p>We would like to say a big thank you to everyone who tried out our beta release of Boundary Desktop for MacOS. We are excited to announce that Boundary Desktop is now generally available. In this initial GA release, we’re introducing some new features and bug fixes, including login via OIDC authentication and AutoUpdate for MacOS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>OIDC login:</strong> Users can now login to Boundary Desktop with an OIDC identity provider.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1618431122-desktop-oidc-whitespace.png\" /><ul>\n<li><strong>AutoUpdate for MacOS</strong>: AutoUpdate the Boundary Desktop app as new versions become available.</li>\n</ul><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1618431499-update-boundary-whitespace.png\" /><p><a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/api-clients/desktop\">Get started with Boundary Desktop here</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#upgrade-details\">»</a><a></a>Upgrade Details</h2>\n<p>Boundary 0.2 introduces significant new functionality.
