A few months later, malware authors are already targeting the new hardware directly. Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-m1-malware/\">interviewed</a> Mac security researcher Patrick Wardle, who discovered an M1-native version of the long-running Mac-targeted <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/targetingedge-mac-os-x-pirrit-malware-adware-still-active\">Pirrit</a> adware family.</p>\n<h2>Apple M1, malware, and you</h2>\n<p>ARM CPUs have a very different Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) than traditional x86 desktop and laptop CPUs do, which means that software designed for one ISA can't run on the other without help. M1 Macs can run x86 software with a translation layer called Rosetta, but native M1 apps of course run much faster—as we can see by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/google-chrome-is-available-as-an-apple-m1-native-app-today/\">comparing</a> Rosetta-translated Google Chrome to the M1-native version.</p>\n<p>When it comes to malware, Apple users have long benefited from the minority status of their platform. Ten years ago, macOS' operating system <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/2011\">market share</a> was only 6.5 percent, and few malware authors bothered to target it at all—but today, that market share is <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide\">approaching</a> 20 percent. That increase in popularity has brought malware vendors along with it; the macOS malware <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-viruses-list-3668354/\">ecosystem</a> is still tiny and relatively crude compared to the one plaguing Windows, but it's very real.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743050#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743050&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"021d8021098bcc15a5582753ad6b02178f3ce5d32af10bc44a7634964e3987fe","category":"Tech"}
