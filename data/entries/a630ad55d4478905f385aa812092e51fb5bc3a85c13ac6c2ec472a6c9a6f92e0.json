These bars can easily be cut down if 800mm is too wide for your taste but can certainly be ridden uncut. </p>\n<p>The pre-order opens today at 10 am PST at <a href=\"https://www.tumbleweed.cc/store/persuader\" target=\"_blank\">Tumbleweed Bicycle Co</a>, with a two-week delivery time. </p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a630ad55d4478905f385aa812092e51fb5bc3a85c13ac6c2ec472a6c9a6f92e0","category":"Cycling"}
