{"title":"Atoms","link":"https://atoms.com/df-march","date":1615141241000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to Atoms for sponsoring last week at DF. Atoms is best known for their everyday shoes. Last year, they expanded into face masks. The shoes are cool-looking and very comfortable; the masks are long-lasting and breathable, with a polyester blend outer layer and a copper-lined ionized quartz yarn inner layer offering 85 percent filtration.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, though, they’re largely sold out.</p>\n\n<p>They’re sold out because Atoms co-founder Sidra Qasim told <a href=\"https://www.atoms.com/hony-story\">an 11-part story</a> for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CKl66T2H4zH/\">the Instagram account Humans of New York</a> that went hyper-viral, and thousands of people who loved her story wound up at the Atoms website buying shoes. It’s a wonderful story — deeply personal, about growing up in Pakistan, building her own life and destiny, and creating a business. A tidbit, from the early days, while she and co-founder (and eventually husband) Waqas Ali were still in Pakistan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We called our collection “Hometown Shoes.” And after we launched our website, the first order came in right away. It was from a person in France who’d been following our story on social media.</p>\n\n<p>Because we had no way of accepting credit cards, he sent us $85 through Western Union. It was a very big moment for us. We had finally discovered a business that would work. But our excitement only lasted until we got to FedEx, and learned that shipping would cost $120. We were torn about what to do. We considered giving the man a refund, but we had been reading so much about customer service. So we ended up shipping the shoes. It was not a promising start. We’d lost a lot of money on our very first sale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone who’s ever launched any new product can sympathize.</p>\n\n<p>I (and Atoms) encourage you to read her story. It’s so good. And you <em>can</em> pre-order shoes and masks while they get them back in stock — orders placed now should ship by the end of April.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Atoms’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/07/atoms\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4716dd72b6c1c77d1e8db1da8c1d118988aad9662bd594ed852c226b4d4bcfdc","category":"Tech"}
