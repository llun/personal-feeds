No one has time for bad books. Literati is the most exciting new way to find and discuss bombshell books with brilliant people — people like Richard Branson, Austin Kleon, Stephen Curry, Malala, and more. It’s the book club for people who don’t like book clubs. New books are revealed monthly, so you can explore every title and choose what you want to read. Then, join discussion threads and exclusive events in the app. <a href=\"https://literati.com/book-clubs/?utm_source=DaringFireballRSS&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=lumitwo&amp;utm_content=luminary\">Start your trial today</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/12/literati\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e9b01b27cf237fe2081494e6ca2304bfc6f0bb2b97daae888efa74f727f3dd79","category":"Tech"}
