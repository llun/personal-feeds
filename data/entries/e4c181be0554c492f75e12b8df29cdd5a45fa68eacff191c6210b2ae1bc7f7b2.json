The relatively low sales for the 12 mini is expected to be due to a trend in the overall market where consumers are veering away from smaller displays and opting for larger, more immersive smartphone sizes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nReports of lackluster &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; sales began <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp/\">emerging</a> in early January, and last week JP Morgan analyst William Yang stated in a note seen by <em><a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/04/apple-may-be-building-more-iphone-12-pro-units-to-meet-strong-demand\">AppleInsider</a></em> that weak demand for the model could result in Apple cutting production entirely in the second quarter of 2021 to allow it to sell through its existing supplies.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLast month Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/apple-1q-2021-earnings/\">reported</a> its quarterly earnings for the first time following the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; in October. While Apple did not disclose specific sales figures for each of the models in the lineup, the company did report &#36;65.60 billion in revenue for its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; business alone, a new quarterly record.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/iphone-12-mini-low-january-sales/\">iPhone 12 Mini Reportedly Accounted for Only 5% of Sales in First Half of January</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-mini-reportedly-accounted-for-only-5-of-sales-in-first-half-of-january.2283992/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VZJc02l-gSE:wGMl1i8Jv-c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VZJc02l-gSE:wGMl1i8Jv-c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VZJc02l-gSE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e4c181be0554c492f75e12b8df29cdd5a45fa68eacff191c6210b2ae1bc7f7b2","category":"Apple"}
