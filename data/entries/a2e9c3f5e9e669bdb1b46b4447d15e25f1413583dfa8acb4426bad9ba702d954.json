The updated ‌iPad Air‌ features no Home Button and an-all screen design. Gurman says the ‌iPad mini‌ 6 will feature a design \"similar\" to the current latest ‌iPad Air‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAppel leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">recently shared renders</a> of what he claims to be the upcoming ‌iPad mini‌. According to the leaker, the ‌iPad mini‌ will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> sensor embedded into the power button, a hardware change first introduced in the ‌iPad Air‌.
