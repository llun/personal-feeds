Though we've seen the controller drop <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/06/dealmaster-get-a-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-for-50/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as low as $50</a> in the past, deals on the Switch Pro pad are generally rare, and this deal matches the lowest price we've tracked in the past year. Nintendo normally sells the device for $70.</p>\n<p>We've previously recommended the Switch Pro Controller in our guide to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/the-best-nintendo-switch-accessories-you-can-buy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best Nintendo Switch accessories</a>. It's only worth buying if you regularly dock your Switch up to a TV, but if that's the case, it will provide a significant comfort upgrade over Nintendo's default Joy-Con controllers. The shape is roomier and easier to grip, the buttons are larger and provide a more satisfying sense of feedback, there's a genuine d-pad, and the whole thing gets an excellent 35-40 hours of battery life per charge. It keeps the same motion control and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/what-is-amiibo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amiibo scanning</a> features, too, and it can be used with Steam on the PC if needed. (Though its lack of pressure-sensitive analog triggers could present issues there.) If you've ever used an Xbox controller, it should feel immediately familiar.</p>\n<p>If you're all set on the Switch front, we also have discounts on good USB-C chargers, Bose noise-canceling headphones, our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 game of the year</a>Â <em>Hades</em>, and much more.
