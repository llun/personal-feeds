Transporter is available as a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.co/app/transporter/id1450874784?mt=12\">free download on the Mac App Store</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMicrosoft continues its work to bring native <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> support to its Mac apps, with its Remote Desktop being the latest to benefit. The app is designed to give Mac users access to a Windows PC via RemoteFX, and includes the ability to access local Mac files from Windows applications as well as printer capabilities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/microsoft-remote-desktop.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with Transporter, the same general improvements that come with Apple silicon support should apply to the latest version of Remote Desktop, version 10.6.0 of which also brings client-side IME support when using Unicode keyboard mode and bug fixes. Remote Desktop is available as a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12\">free download from the Mac App Store</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://the8-bit.com/microsoft-updates-its-remote-desktop-app-with-support-for-apple-silicon-macs/\">The 8-Bit</a>.)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/transporter-remote-desktop-apple-silicon-support/\">Apple Transporter and Microsoft Remote Desktop Gain Native M1 Mac Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-transporter-and-microsoft-remote-desktop-gain-native-m1-mac-support.2291766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HNKFkx4O4So:f-3fEhz2zzA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HNKFkx4O4So:f-3fEhz2zzA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HNKFkx4O4So\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f79043978334e09f5bd906548f99e7f3bfa245a0b0653fa6550eb890f39f10f3","category":"Apple"}
