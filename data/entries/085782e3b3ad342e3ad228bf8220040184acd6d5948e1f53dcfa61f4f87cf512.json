It is also compatible with the USB-C <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models and the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, which is equipped with USB-C.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/caldigit-hdmi-usb-c-dock-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"585\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783143\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAs a universal dock option, when paired with a Thunderbolt 3 laptop, the HDMI USB-C Dock offers a full 40Gb/s performance, and when connected to a USB-C laptop, it offers 10Gb/s performance.

With CalDigit's software, all external drives connected to the dock can be ejected with a click, and it supports standalone charging so you can charge accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Apple Watch at up to 7.5W with no laptop connected.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/caldigit-usb-c-hdmi-dock-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1126\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783150\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWe have five of the HDMI USB-C Docks to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
