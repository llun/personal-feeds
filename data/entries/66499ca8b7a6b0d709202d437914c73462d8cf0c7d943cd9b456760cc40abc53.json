Instead, Nixxes has primarily specialized in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/nixxes-software-bv/3010-7513/\">creating a variety of PC and console ports</a> for games from the likes of Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics (both now Square Enix subsidiaries).</p>\n<p>That makes Nixxes an especially intriguing acquisition for Sony, which has been slowly dipping an increasing number of toes into the PC gaming space in recent years.
