For drivers who have embraced the always-connected lifestyle, it's undoubtedly the vehicle technology they'll directly interact with the most. As such, the features, performance, and user experience provided by these systems can have far-reaching implications for customers' overall impression of their automobiles.</p>\n<p>It's something Stellantis has been well aware of for some time now. Back in 2003, Chrysler Group was the first North American automaker to offer Bluetooth technology in its vehicles, laying the groundwork for what would eventually become Uconnect 1.0.</p>\n<p>In the years since, Uconnect has gone on to become one of the standard-bearers for OEM infotainment. Often at the forefront of emerging connectivity options and software integration, Uconnect has regularly been praised for its <a href=\"https://driving.ca/jeep/auto-news/entertainment/why-we-love-fcas-uconnect-in-jeeps-rams-and-chryslers\">responsive performance</a> and <a href=\"https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=13674&amp;mid=\">robust feature set</a>—both key struggling points for many manufacturers back in infotainment's early years. The Uconnect ecosystem would continue to mature with the launch of 3.0 in 2013 and 4.0 in 2016, the latter being one of the earliest to adopt Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in a wide breadth of vehicles across various market segments.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745454#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745454&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"daff6479eba7b1f6f95d9343d57d8076505e76338fa448617a6ce157858ac62d","category":"Tech"}
