But while we&rsquo;re not expecting major changes to the hardware aside from a new chip and possibly new storage options, it could be getting an upgrade to the thing everyone hates: the remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we don&rsquo;t have any specifics about that a new Apple TV remote will look like, there are enough clues to suggest it will be a major change to the existing model. First, <a style=\"font-size: inherit; display: inline !important;\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/340537/tvos-14-5-beta-new-siri-remote-facetime-support.html\">Macrumors reported last week</a> that the iOS 14.5 beta references to the Siri Remote have been replaced by the Apple TV Remote and the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; button is now called the &ldquo;TV&rdquo; button. Then, earlier this week <a style=\"font-size: inherit; display: inline !important;\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/29/apple-developing-new-remote-for-the-next-generation-apple-tv/&amp;xcust=1-1-342131-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">9to5Mac reported</a> that its well-placed sources reported that a new remote with the code name &ldquo;B519&rdquo; is being developed. For reference, the current Siri remote has the code name &ldquo;B439.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;ve heard of a new Apple TV remote. Last March, <a style=\"font-size: inherit; display: inline !important;\" href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/new-apple-tv-3663891/\">9to5Mac also found references to a new Apple TV remote</a> in the leaked iOS 14 code and <a style=\"font-size: inherit; display: inline !important;\" href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/apple-targets-75-million-5g-iphones-for-fall-product-blitz&amp;xcust=1-1-342131-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">a Bloomberg report from September</a> also claimed that &ldquo;a new Apple TV box with a faster processor for improved gaming and an upgraded remote control&rdquo; was in the works with a feature similar to Find My iPhone that would make it easier to find when it falls between the couch cushions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s more than enough evidence to turn us into believers. What we don&rsquo;t know is what the new remote will look like&mdash;or even if it will look different at all. We have to assume it will though. The Siri remote has been the bane of many an Apple TV user, with a design that prioritizes form over function, has too few buttons and a less-than-ideal trackpad-based navigation, and is way too easy to misplace. We&rsquo;re hoping a new model features a design closer to the Apple TV remote of old&rsquo;s navigation ring, includes a dedicated button for the increasingly important TV app or possible Apple TV+, and isn&rsquo;t so difficult to figure out which end is up. And hopefully, we won&rsquo;t have to wait too much longer.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"The 10 worst Apple products of all time","siteHash":"dc9b1b0c39580f1b11190be9edc7b842afb3b06d03e2c06f042173e05db33816","entryHash":"7780954adc240cd1af343a14f0c08feafa6ef3cb967a6a1d6f081c36d29e4d69","category":"Apple"}
