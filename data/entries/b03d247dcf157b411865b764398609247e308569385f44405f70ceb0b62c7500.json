For example, the program could help advertisers identify\npeople who enjoy cooking or are sports enthusiasts, the company\nsaid. […]</p>\n\n<p>A T-Mobile spokeswoman said the changes give subscribers\nadvertising that aligns with their interests. “We’ve heard many\nsay they prefer more relevant ads so we’re defaulting to this\nsetting,” she said. […] The company said the changes wouldn’t\napply to business accounts or children’s lines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If it’s such a great idea that customers just love, why not turn it on for everyone, including business accounts and children’s lines?</p>\n\n<p>Just more proof that no matter what Apple or Google or Microsoft do to help make our devices more private at the operating system level, we’re at the mercy of the companies providing us with internet access, whether through home landline service or cellular.
