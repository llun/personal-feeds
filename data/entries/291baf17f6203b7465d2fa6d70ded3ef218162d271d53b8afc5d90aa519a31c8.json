We've seen year-long memberships <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/02/dealmaster-grab-another-year-of-playstation-plus-for-40-2/\" target=\"_blank\">go for less</a> on multiple occasions over the years, but this discount is still $15 off the service's usual going rate. The discount comes as part of Sony's official <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/05/playstation-days-of-play-sale-best-ps4-ps5-deals/\" target=\"_blank\">Days of Play sale</a>, and the company <a href=\"https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/deals\" target=\"_blank\">says it</a> will be valid until June 10.</p>\n<p>As a refresher, PlayStation Plus is still required to play online multiplayer in most PS4 and PS5 games, nets users access to a few free games each month, and hosts a few extra discounts on PlayStation's digital storefront. If you mostly stick to single-player games, it isn't as vital, but a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/sony-lists-pc-version-of-uncharted-4-in-investor-report/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Sony investor report said</a> the service had almost 48 million subscribers in the 2020 fiscal year.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, Sony has also discounted its PlayStation Now service, with 12- and 3-month subscriptions currently <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3yVzHAT\" target=\"_blank\">marked down to $45</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3i9ncf8\" target=\"_blank\">$20</a>. While not a direct competitor, this is the closest thing Sony has to anÂ <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/05/new-users-can-get-3-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-1-today/\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Game Pass alternative</a>, as it bundles together various PlayStation games for one monthly fee. Its selection isn't as stocked with as many high-profile brand new games as Game Pass, but it does include <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-now/ps-now-games/#all-ps-now-games\" target=\"_blank\">several worthwhile titles</a> from across the PS4, PS3, and PS2 libraries, including a number of older exclusives.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768873#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768873&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"291baf17f6203b7465d2fa6d70ded3ef218162d271d53b8afc5d90aa519a31c8","category":"Tech"}
