Microsoft and Apple got into a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/06/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-android-only/\">heated public argument last year</a> over <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> guidelines that rejected apps such as xCloud from being available on the ‌App Store‌. Apple eventually <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/11/apple-updates-app-store-review-guidelines/\">changed the policy</a>, allowing such apps onto the platform, but requiring that every game offered via the service be submitted independently for review. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMicrosoft has decided not to follow through with the new policy and will instead offer users access to xCloud via Safari on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. Alongside xCloud on Safari, the streaming service will also launch on Edge and Chrome. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xcloud/\">xCloud</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/microsoft-xcloud-launching-safari-few-weeks/\">Microsoft xCloud Game Streaming Service Launching on Safari in a 'Few Weeks'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-service-launching-on-safari-in-a-few-weeks.2300284/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YZAD6tRYVO8:pk2byeHxekg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YZAD6tRYVO8:pk2byeHxekg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YZAD6tRYVO8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"92cf077491a520605dbefccdacf39d0630c1e3828817eb6cb5252453309be540","category":"Apple"}
