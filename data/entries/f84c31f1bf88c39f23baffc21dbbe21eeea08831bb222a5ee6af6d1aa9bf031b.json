The iOS app and Dark Sky website will also be available until the end of 2022.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dark Sky's developers initially said the API would shut down at the end of 2021, but this new end-of-2022 target obviously moves things back a bit. This is the first time we've heard about an end date for the iOS app, though.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772165#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772165&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f84c31f1bf88c39f23baffc21dbbe21eeea08831bb222a5ee6af6d1aa9bf031b","category":"Tech"}
