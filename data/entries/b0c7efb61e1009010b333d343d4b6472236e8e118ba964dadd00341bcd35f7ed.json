Apple said the serial number format transition is scheduled for \"early 2021,\" and confirmed that IMEI numbers will not be affected by this change.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAny currently shipping Apple products will continue to use the current serial number format, while future products will use the new format, according to Apple. The new serial numbers will initially be 10 characters, the company indicated.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's current serial number format has long allowed both customers and service providers to determine the date and location that a product was manufactured, with the first three characters representing the manufacturing location and the following two indicating the year and week of manufacture. The last four characters currently serve as a \"configuration code,\" revealing a device's model, color, and storage capacity.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple initially planned to transition to the new serial number format <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/06/apple-randomized-serial-numbers-late-2020/\">in late 2020</a>, but delayed.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/apple-randomized-serial-numbers-early-2021/\">Apple Planning Switch to Randomized Serial Numbers for Future Products Starting in &#039;Early 2021&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-switch-to-randomized-serial-numbers-for-future-products-starting-in-early-2021.2287714/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OWCepaDnWdI:qLsaotPhEhA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OWCepaDnWdI:qLsaotPhEhA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OWCepaDnWdI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b0c7efb61e1009010b333d343d4b6472236e8e118ba964dadd00341bcd35f7ed","category":"Apple"}
