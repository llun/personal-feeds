In <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/gallery-tour-de-france-time-trial-tech-part-one/\" target=\"_blank\">part one</a>, I covered a number of bikes (including a few unreleased ones) and teased a few wheel setups. In this second part I continue with a look at fast wheels before diving into the smaller details that make these machines so fast.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t already, be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/time-trial-bikes-of-the-tour-de-france/\" target=\"_blank\">video on time trial bikes of the Tour</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 5 was like Christmas morning for time trial fans with new frames, new tyres, and of course new wheels. Here is a selection of new and unreleased wheels on show. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Astana had this white disc on one bike. No word on whether there are any further differences compared to the standard wheel, but it looked super light.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>And it is a tubular rim.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>But more interestingly the thin white walls give a good insight into the wheel internals.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Team Movistar ran a selection of wheels, including the 858 NSW with Continental GP5000TL.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>EF Education-Nippo riders had the same tubeless wheel, but with 25 mm Vittoria Corsa Speed 2.0 tubeless tyres with team-kit-matching valve cores.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Dylan Thuens was another rider on tubless Vision wheels with Continental GP5000 TL tyres.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Most Vision-equipped teams opted for the new tubeless-ready Metron TFW (The Fastest Wheel) disc wheel.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>BikeExchange also opted for the new tubeless Metron disc.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most interestingly, some Cofidis riders had an as-yet-unannounced Fulcrum disc brake disc wheel, which is seemingly tubeless compatible. If anything like the Campagnolo Bora Ultra, this Fulcrum should be quite lightweight also.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The new wheels seem to have a very similar construction to the current tubular rim brake Fulcrum Speed disc, but feature disc brake and tubeless tyre compatibility.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Cofidis riders had the new wheel on a new disc brake TT bike from De Rosa. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Cofidis previously used rim brake De Rosas with Fulcrum’s rim brake tubular disc wheels. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tyres choices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a lot of wheels. My head was spinning trying to catch every wheel zooming past, but I did still manage to spot a few interesting tyre selections. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Chris Froome was running some hidden Continental tyres. There’s always one. Well actually, there is always a lot of teams on hidden Contis.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The Groupama-FDJ spare bikes featured rim brake tubular disc wheels from Pro with Continental ProLTD tubulars. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>While some of the race bikes had prototype (and presumably tubeless) Continentals. the tyres are logo’d GrandPrix TT and coded 111.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The tyre seems to feature the tread off the GP4000, a tread pattern said to be very aerodynamically efficient. We can only presume the compound is faster and perhaps lighter.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Team Qhubeka-NextHash had a hidden tyre too.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bars</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time trial bars used to be simple, round, ski-pole-style extensions; now it seems they are getting more elaborate by the day. We spotted a host of new bars on show at the stage 5 time trial. Everything from carbon fibre to 3D-printed, from stock sizes to fully customisable. I didn’t dare ask for prices. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Vision has a new much more aerodynamically profiled extension designed to almost hug the arm and create a more aerodynamically efficient setup. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Again, the Vision logo was everywhere.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Rest yourself.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>There’s a variety of stack heights and stack angles.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>For the most part the actual bar seemed relatively similar across a lot of bikes …</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>… with a few notable exceptions, first up being Wout Poels’s setup. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>We featured Steven Kruijswijk’s P5 in our TT bikes video. He has since changed his bars. Apparently the new bars only arrived late last week.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Even excluding the mono riser, these bars seem very different to the other Vision extensions on show. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Much more custom-like.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Primoż Roglič’s bars also looked very custom made. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Some Vision-equipped riders still ran the current TFE (The Fastest Extensions) extensions. It’s not yet clear if Vision will have to change this name with the forthcoming new extension.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Tadej Pogačar’s extensions are designed to perfectly house his SRM head unit. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Pogačar’s bars are pretty narrow and show a pretty smooth frontal area to the wind.  </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Israel Start-Up Nation has partnered with UK-based Watt Shop for time trialling optimisation. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>It’s no surprise to see Watt Shop Anemoi extensions with the tall wall elbow pads on Mike Woods’s bike. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Most of the new Treks featured what I assume is the new Bontrager bar and extensions. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Except Bauke Mollema who had another version of the modern extension.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>A frontal view of Mollema’s bars. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Mathieu van der Poel flew in some Aerocoach Ascalon extensions and elbow pads. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Another take on the modern TT extension.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Arkéa Samsic’s Conor Swift had yet another version of the extension, this time from UK-based Drag2Zero.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>We only ever see these bars from above or head on. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Here is the Wilier offering from a less common angle.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Bolt-on and adjustable grips.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard rolled out for his morning recon ride with this unidentified object at the front of his bike. While it is almost certainly an aero-sensor, it is unlikely the rider was making any last-minute changes to his TT position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all likelihood, the device was collecting course and weather condition data for race equipment selection and pacing strategies. Whatever it was the Jumbo-Visma mechanics were keen to remove it and stow it away in a tool box quickly after the end of the recon ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope to bring you more news on this sensor soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>I spotted this aero sensor on the front of Jonas Vingegaard’s P5.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>It was kept closely under wraps, but I got one more shot of it on the bike after the recon.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>It then went into the tool box.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>A closer look at this sensor.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Another view of this unknown sensor.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is not so much a new tech story, but rather an interesting shift. For as long as radios have crackled in the pro peloton riders have carried them on their backs. Personally, I hated seeing a rider wearing a super-fast skinsuit only to have a block-shaped box sticking up on their back, no doubt negating some of the suit’s performance gains. It seems Chris Froome and others have now taken to placing the radio in the much-less-exposed chest area. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gearing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Big plates all round. When a 58-tooth is the smallest on camera, you know its a fast day. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>58 tooth for Stefan Bissegger.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>58-tooth for Emanuel Buchmann.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>58-tooth for Pogačar.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>And the winner is Max Walscheid with a massive 60-tooth chainring, and one of the only waxed chains on show.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike is only one part of the aero story; clothing and helmets play a key role in the full system optimisation too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>We spotted this new Ekoi helmet launched just days before the start of the Tour.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The Veloce is used by Lotto Soudal, Cofidis, and Qhubeka-NextHash</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Nairo Quintana opted for the current Ekoi TT helmet.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Classification leaders must wear a Tour de France sponsor-provided skinsuit. It is often said these skinsuits lack the detail of the teams’ own modern suits. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>But these suits are hardly lacking in detail either. Quite often the suit is tailored to the specific rider, and even appears to have trip strips to help with airflow over the body.  The UCI commissaires might have to get measuring the depth of these trip strips on the Tour skinsuits to ensure no repeat of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/07/vortex-controversy-backstory-team-skys-new-aerodynamic-skinsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">Castelli / Sky vortex generator saga</a>.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Van der Poel also wore a Tour-provided skinsuit and Aerocoach overshoes. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>EF Education-Nippo riders had Rapha’s new pro-rider-only aerosuit. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>With optimised fabrics and seam locations, this is reportedly the fastest suit Rapha has ever made. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The attention to detail and fit is impressive. <br /></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Alpecin-Fenix riders wore Canyon (Abus) aero helmets …<br /></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>… but Van der Poel opted for the Lazer Volante TT helmet.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fluids</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hydration is key in any race but round bottles are almost the opposite of aero – TT-specific bottles can offer a more aerodynamic option. However, as with all aerodynamics, it’s never just as simple as aero shaped equals improved aerodynamics. The UCI has also a stipulated minimum liquid content at the start and any aero gains from the bottle could disappear if the rider was to sit up and drink that liquid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, here are a few aero alternatives I spotted. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Many riders reached for the Elite Chrono CX time trial specific bottle.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The latest-generation Chrono CX has dropped the dimpled effect.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Van der Poel returned from the recon ride with a Chrono CX bottle …</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>.. but raced with no bottle.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Quintana had perhaps the most peculiar setup: aero bottle cage with no bottle. Perhaps he dropped the bottle on route.  </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Carapaz and the Ineos Grenadiers opted for slightly smaller and narrower round bottles. The down tube of the Bolide TT is exceptionally wide and as such can perhaps hide the round bottle from the wind.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>The Cervelo P5 has a proprietary bottle which seems designed to fill in the frame opening without falling foul of the UCI regulations. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Despite a number of riders using the bottle for their recon ride, Tony Martin was the only rider I spotted racing with the bottle.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Positions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most important though when it comes to aerodynamics is the rider’s position on the bike. I have heard the rider can account for 80% of the total drag. While that figure likely differs from rider to rider, a dialled time trial position can offer not-so-marginal gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Stefan Küng is a TT specialist and as such has optimised his position.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Roglič’s position looked different to what we have seen from him previously. Perhaps an intentional change, or perhaps as a result of the injuries sustained in his stage 3 crash.  </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Pogačar worked on his time trial over the winter. That work certainly paid off yesterday.  </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img /><figcaption>Warning! Van der Poel can be even faster in time trials. </figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you have it, all the tech from this year’s Tour de France stage 5 time trial. Who cares about the actual result – here’s hoping for another tech-filled day on the stage 20 time trial!</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/gallerytour-de-france-time-trial-tech-part-two/\">Read More</a>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"87080c2a4f266875fe26c7e5edcd39504cc5c4ea9546580d2494f66ac4db1129","category":"Cycling"}
