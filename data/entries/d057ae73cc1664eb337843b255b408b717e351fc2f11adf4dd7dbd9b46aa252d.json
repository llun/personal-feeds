{"title":"‘Follow’ Is the new ‘Subscribe’ for Apple Podcasts","link":"https://podnews.net/update/follow-not-subscribe","date":1615396208000,"content":"\n<p>James Cridland, writing for Podnews:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Podcasts will no longer use the word “subscribe” in a few\nweeks. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s3SSIQOlqI\">Listeners will be invited to “follow” their favourite\npodcasts instead</a>. The new wording will be in iOS 14.5, which\nshould be released later this month (and is available in beta). We\nexpect Apple to communicate further with creators, and listeners,\nwhen this version of iOS is released.</p>\n\n<p>This seemingly small change could dramatically affect the\nindustry. Tom Webster from Edison Research <a href=\"https://podnews.net/update/follow-not-subscribe\">says 47% of people who\ndon’t currently listen to podcasts think that ‘subscribing’ to a\npodcast will cost money</a>, describing it as a stone in the shoe\nof podcasting’s growth run. He tells Podnews: “Today, Apple,\nSpotify, and YouTube are the three most widely used services to\nplay podcasts, and now the word Subscribe means ‘automatically\ndownload for free’ in exactly none of them. Podcasters will have\nno choice but to adapt their language accordingly or risk\nconfusing listeners.”</p>\n\n<p>Other larger podcast apps have already changed: Spotify and\nAudible use “follow”, Stitcher uses “+ follow”, and Amazon Music\nuses “♡ follow”. Meanwhile, Google Podcasts and Castbox use “+\nSubscribe”, and Overcast and Castro uses “Subscribe”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think I like this change. It clarifies what’s free and what’s paid using common words. It removes confusion from a service that wants to both sell access to paid podcasts <em>and</em> allow users to sign up for regular old-fashioned free podcasts. <em>And</em> it removes confusion for users who hear the word <em>subscribe</em> and think it implies <em>paid</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/\">follow The Talk Show</a> and <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">subscribe to Dithering</a> — thanks.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Follow’ Is the new ‘Subscribe’ for Apple Podcasts’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/10/follow-subscribe-apple-podcasts\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d057ae73cc1664eb337843b255b408b717e351fc2f11adf4dd7dbd9b46aa252d","category":"Tech"}
