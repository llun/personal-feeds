That's not a remark on its 360p resolution or 8-bit color depth; we've seen plenty of games work within such confines while looking beautiful and fluid. But this dark RPG doubles down on simplicity, thanks to itty-bitty sprites, limited animations, and a menu-swapping interface that combine to scream the word \"boring.\"\n<p>The game includes some aesthetic exceptions, particularly a few higher-res illustrations, but the point stands. <em>Loop Hero</em> was made to work within the processing confines of an '80s PC, as opposed to immediately capturing your imagination at a single glance. The reason lies in the game's key design principle: in more respects than any other RPG we've seen, <em>Loop Hero</em> wrests direct control away from the player. If you thought the menu-driven combat of pioneering JRPGs was too \"hands-on,\" you ain't seen nothin'.</p>\n<p>In a figurative sense, this game reimagines Camelot as a hamster wheel, where knights like Sir Galahad have become tiny, pixellated cogs. Yet as boring as that might sound, I cannot stop playing this game.</p>\n<p>After nearly writing off this Devolver Digital game as another uninspired, lo-fi indie game, I decided—admittedly, upon a colleague's prodding—to give <em>Loop Hero</em> a spin. Pretty quickly, I discovered a fascinating twist on the \"idle\" genre—thanks to how it gives players significant choices, secrets, upgrades, and even a compelling narrative. The results won't be everyone's cup of barely interactive tea, but if you like the idea of a \"second monitor\" game with tasteful dashes of tower defense and deckbuilding, you should seriously consider running <em>Loop Hero</em> in the background of your nerdy life.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746823#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746823&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a51141e8d17a25f70c983a2f80cc829053959db0d42e3b323d39ba19574b43c","category":"Tech"}
