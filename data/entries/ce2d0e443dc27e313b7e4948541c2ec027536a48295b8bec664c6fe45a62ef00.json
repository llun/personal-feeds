One of the Democrats was Adam Schiff, who now serves as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Department of Justice subjected Apple to a gag order that expired earlier this year, with Apple informing lawmakers they had been investigated just last month. Biden's Justice Department revealed the subpoenas and gag orders to the press this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>The New York Times</em>, Apple provided metadata and \"other account information,\" but did not give the DoJ photos, emails, or other content. The records did not link the committee to the leaks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe full report on the subpoenas and the circumstances behind them can be read over at <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/justice-department-leaks-trump-administration.html\">The New York Times</a></em>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/apple-doj-trump-subpoenas/\">Trump Administration Subpoenaed Apple for Data on Two House Intelligence Committee Democrats</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-administration-subpoenaed-apple-for-data-on-two-house-intelligence-committee-democrats.2300370/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AXP2NkmLuzA:NOcViAa2NRM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AXP2NkmLuzA:NOcViAa2NRM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AXP2NkmLuzA\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce2d0e443dc27e313b7e4948541c2ec027536a48295b8bec664c6fe45a62ef00","category":"Apple"}
