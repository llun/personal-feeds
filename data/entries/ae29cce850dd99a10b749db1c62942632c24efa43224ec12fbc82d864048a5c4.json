The proposal would involve a multibillion-dollar investment, according to people familiar with the matter, who stress that a deal hasn’t been completed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHyundai has talked to Apple about investing more than &#36;3 billion in a deal that would see its subsidiary Kia begin building cars under the tech company’s brand as soon as 2024, a person familiar with the matter said. Under such an agreement, up to 100,000 vehicles could be assembled in the first year in Georgia, where Kia has a factory, the person said.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, in Asia, <em>Nikkei</em> reports that Apple is in discussions with at least six Japanese automakers over supply partnerships and manufacturing contributions (via <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/japan-carmakers-jump-after-nikkei-report-on-apple-ev-development\">Bloomberg</a></em>). Honda and Mazda said they couldn't comment on rumors that they had been approached by Apple, while Mitsubishi said it had not been contacted and Nissan declined to comment.  \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Tatsuo Yoshida, a senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, Japanese automakers are usually too busy with their own development, manufacturing, sales and customer service to take on a task like working with Apple. However, Nissan or Mitsubishi \"don’t have much work, and are somewhat idle, so they might sign up,\" he said.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; rumors have swirled for weeks now, with Apple said to be aiming to have a vehicle‌ in production in 2024, though it's possible that timeline will be delayed as work on the ‌&zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;‌ is still in the early stages. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-launch-5-to-7-years-away/\">recently said</a> it would be five to seven years before an ‌&zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;‌ is ready to launch, while Apple analyst Ming-Chu Kuo said this week that he expects to see the ‌&zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;‌ in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/kuo-apple-car-use-hyundai-e-gmp-platform/\">at the earliest</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEarlier this week it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/first-apple-car-no-driver-fully-autonomous/\">reported</a> that the first &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; to be released will not be designed to operate with a driver and could be marketed for food delivery operations and firms that incorporate robotaxis.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kia/\">Kia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-car-kia-talks-georgia-assembly/\">Apple Car Latest: Kia Talks With Potential Partners About Vehicle Assembly in Georgia, While Apple Seeks Supply Deals With Japanese Automakers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-latest-kia-talks-with-potential-partners-about-vehicle-assembly-in-georgia-while-apple-seeks-supply-deals-with-japanese-automakers.2283414/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=41Y8nduGXM8:-zFu6fl8Dek:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=41Y8nduGXM8:-zFu6fl8Dek:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/41Y8nduGXM8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae29cce850dd99a10b749db1c62942632c24efa43224ec12fbc82d864048a5c4","category":"Apple"}
