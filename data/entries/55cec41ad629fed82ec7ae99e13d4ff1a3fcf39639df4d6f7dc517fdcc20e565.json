That's $80 off Bose's MSRP, about $65 off the street price we typically see online, and tied for the best price we've tracked.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we generally recommend</a> Sony's WH-1000XM4 as the top choice among wireless noise-canceling headphones, this Bose pair is a strong alternative. Its battery life isn't as good, but its metal headband gives the design a more premium feel, and it offers a more neutral sound profile than the XM4's more bass-heavy default signature.</p>\n<p>And though its active noise cancellation isn't <em>quite </em>as effective as the XM4's at maximum, it's not terribly far off. Perhaps more importantly, Bose's companion app lets you customize the strength of the noise-canceling effect on a 10-point scale, so you can lessen the intensity if you're somewhere that's only mildly noisy. If you need that extra flexibility—or if ultrastrong active noise cancellation tends to bring you discomfort—the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are a worthwhile option in the premium bracket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746329#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746329&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"55cec41ad629fed82ec7ae99e13d4ff1a3fcf39639df4d6f7dc517fdcc20e565","category":"Tech"}
