The two final courses yet have to be detailed, but the first course with two modules, called \"Swift Coding and App Development,\" costs &#36;350 for the estimated 180 hours of work, and has the following <a href=\"https://digitalflagship.catalog.instructure.com/courses/swiftcoding-appdevelopment-level1\">description</a>:\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>From the basics of Swift and Xcode to the coding communities that surround you, this Level 1 course will provide you the foundational knowledge to start building and creating apps. Debugging, problem-solving, basic interface design and connections to external fields will also be covered.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOnce completing what Ohio State has to offer, participants can go on to obtain <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/learn/curriculum/\">Appleâ€™s App Development with Swift certification</a>. Ohio State director of learning programs and Digital Flagship Cory Tressler says that app coding and development serves as a foundation for future learning and innovation in the digital world, emphasizing the ability for anyone regardless of background to learn to code.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>\"This coding and app development certificate program allows anyone, regardless of their background or prior knowledge with coding, the opportunity to learn a tangible, applicable digital skill that will not only provide them immediate skills to utilize and explore, but also a foundation for future learning, innovation and creativity in the digital world.\"</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOhio State is one of many universities and colleges offering lessons and courses based on Apple's programming language and platform. As developers serve as the bedrock for Apple's product experience, Apple often works closely on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/apple-updates-everyone-can-code-curriculum/\">updating its curriculum</a> to ensure the next generation of developers are learning and getting ready to develop apps.
