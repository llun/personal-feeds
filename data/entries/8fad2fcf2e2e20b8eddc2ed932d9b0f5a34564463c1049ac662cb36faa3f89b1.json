He clarified that was an estimate for how long it would take the company to \"build capacity\" to potentially address supply shortages. The conversation came as Intel offered to step up for two supply chains particularly pinched by the silicon drought: medical supplies and in-car computer systems.</p>\n<p>In previous statements, Gelsinger pointed to <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/03/Intel-Arizona-manufacturing-15073363.pdf\">Intel's current $20 billion plan</a> to build a pair of factories in Arizona, and this week's interview added praise for <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/bidens-infrastructure-plan-will-bolster-the-us-semiconductor-industry-commerce-secretary.html\">President Joe Biden's proposed $50 billion chip-production infrastructure plan</a>—though Gelsinger indicated that Biden should be ready to spend more than that.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757129#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757129&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8fad2fcf2e2e20b8eddc2ed932d9b0f5a34564463c1049ac662cb36faa3f89b1","category":"Tech"}
