The new-look replaces the diagonal background pattern, initially introduced into Opera Touch, with flat surfaces and removing shadows on bubbles and other elements. </blockquote>New icons have been added in the bottom bar and the floating Fast Action button, which users can touch to access a radial menu and swipe through several one-handed actions with their thumb.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe browser also includes a feature called Flow that uses a QR code to securely link the iOS app with the Mac, allowing users to share links, notes, images, files, and other information over a secure and private connection, no logins required.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn addition, Opera comes with a built-in Ethereum wallet, built-in ad blocking, and protection against disguised online cryptocurrency mining, or \"cryptojacking\".\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOpera says its iOS user base increased by over 65% in the 12 months to February, and believes that the growth has been partly thanks to Apple's decision to let users <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/change-default-web-browser-iphone-ipad/\">choose a default browser in iOS 14</a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOpera is available for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> in several languages and can be downloaded directly from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
