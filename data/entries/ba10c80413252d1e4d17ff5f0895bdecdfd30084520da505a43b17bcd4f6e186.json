It is made from black ballistic nylon with a full-grain leather accent that's available in chocolate, gray, black, or crimson.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lrKrFxz-5Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are two main compartments. The front chamber is designed to hold all of the items needed for a day at the office, while the back chamber zips down and can hold a MacBook, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or documents. The backpack can be paired with an optional Executive Folio that serves a as a sleeve for a MacBook. The Pro Backpack is compatible with all of Apple's MacBook models, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/waterfield-designs-executive-backpack-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784660\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen set down, the backpack is designed to stay upright to make the items inside easier to access, and there are padded shoulder straps and a back slot for using with a suitcase. Along with the main compartments, where are two large side pockets, a deep front pocket, and two front panel zip pockets accessible when the backpack is swung down from a shoulder.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/waterfield-designs-executive-backpack-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"802\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784661\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAvailable starting at &#36;89, the <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/products/airpods-max-shield-case\">AirPods Max Shield Case</a> is the case that Apple should have offered with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> instead of the Smart Case, which has turned out to be unpopular with &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; owners. Unlike the default Smart Case, the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; Shield Case from WaterField Designs offers complete protection for the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ydyWb50zgA?list=TLGGqPDRCUCynLMxOTAyMjAyMQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; Shield Case is ideal if you need to tuck your &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; away in a backpack or bag for travel. It has three layers of protection along with a soft, plush interior that protects the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; from scratches. Waterproof zippers are included to protect against accidental water damage, and the zippers can be just partially closed to allow for charging in the case.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/waterfield-design-airpods-max-case-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-776563\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's an interior pocket to hold a power adapter or other accessories, a stretchy mesh back pocket, and an easy-access panel at the front. A nylon loop at the top can be added to a carabiner or used as a handle. A built-in Magnetic Butterfly feature is designed to put the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; in low-power mode when they're placed in the case in order to save battery life, plus it serves as a separator between the ear cups.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/waterfield-design-airpods-max.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-776562\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are several leather variants priced at &#36;99, along with four vegan options in water-resistant Forza fabric that are available for &#36;89. Both versions are identical with the exception of the outer material. There's a chocolate/waxed leather model and three with leather and ballistic nylon in blue black and crimson. Vegan models come in black, green, red, and blue.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/waterfield-design-shield-case-vegan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784658\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWe have a Pro Executive Backpack and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; Shield Case to give away to one <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
