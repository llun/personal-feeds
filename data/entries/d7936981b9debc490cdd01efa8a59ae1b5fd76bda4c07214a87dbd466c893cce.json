Such bugs have included skipping playback, inaccurate timestamps, skewed UI elements, and unresponsive scrolling.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most bemoaned aspects of Apple's Podcasts app has been its issues with syncing, where users have found that the app outright fails to sync episodes added to a library, individual podcast settings, and listened to episodes across devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple sometimes gets an unfairly bad rap for its cloud services‚Äî<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/\">iCloud Photo Library</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/\">iCloud Drive</a> both work well‚Äîbut whatever they‚Äôre doing to sync podcast state across devices is an unmitigated disaster and has been for years.</p>‚Äî Jim Wong (@james_d_wong) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/james_d_wong/status/1387675388566904845?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>How many updates do Apple need to release for Podcasts to make the thing sync between devices?

Worse still, users will have to continue marking every episode of a podcast that they do not want to listen to as played in order to remove it from view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>So Apple Podcasts app in ios 14.5: i want to hide already played episodes and you didn‚Äôt bring over the list of episodes i‚Äôve heard from ios 14.4 so now i have to go through hundreds of episodes and mark each one as played and there‚Äôs no bulk way to do that. nice. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppleSupport</a></p>‚Äî John Martinetto (@bigjohn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigjohn/status/1386919990230589440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 27, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Same thing happened to me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppleSupport</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ApplePodcasts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ApplePodcasts</a> play history got obliterated by iOS 14.5</p>‚Äî Glenn Frye (@glenn_frye14) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/glenn_frye14/status/1387365809681571840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince you can no longer add an individual podcast to your library, you can also no longer remove a podcast from your library, leaving countless episodes in users' lists with no way of removing them from view except marking them as played and toggling \"Hide Played Episodes\" on in Settings.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not yet clear if this is intended behavior, at least in part. Apple has fundamentally changed the way in which podcasts exist within a library in iOS 14.5. There is no longer a library that users can add episodes to. This means that the \"library\" side of podcasts that users now see is effectively the direct view of feeds, with all episodes on display, rather than what they have chosen to add or remove themselves.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince Apple has hamstrung the library feature in iOS 14.5, effectively removing the ability to add or remove episodes, there is even <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplePodcasts/comments/mz4e7f/ios_145_apple_podcasts/\">greater confusion</a> among users about how to remove or delete the hundreds of newly-added episodes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>How do you delete played podcasts on ios 14.5 <br />üò≠üò≠ plz help.

But for many types of podcasts, such as news podcasts, where it is pointless to listen to older episodes and users may want to sometimes skip an episode, it is actively obstructive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll in all, many of these problems seem to be design changes rather than overt bugs, brought on by Apple's virtual removal of the concept of an individual podcast library. Separate issues such as a bug preventing episode limits from working have only exacerbated this problem.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther, more simple design changes in iOS 14.5's Podcasts app have also met the wrath of users. Apple has removed the \"recently updated\" tab and the ability to see how many unplayed episodes there are per show. Podcasts are also now sorted by the order in which they were originally followed by default.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppleSupport</a> Updated to iOS 14.5.
