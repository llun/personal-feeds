It's a two-and-a-half-mile track around the place, so put in a couple of laps and you've got a good workout for the day.\" \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"We all know intuitively, and now with research, that physical activity is a key part of longevity and quality of life,\" Cook added, reiterating that Apple's greatest contribution to mankind will likely be in the health and wellness space.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe interview builds on Cook's appearance on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/09/tim-cook-outside-magazine-interview/\"><em>Outside</em> magazine podcast episode</a> last month, where he discussed similar topics. On that podcast, Cook teased that Apple is testing \"mind blowing\" capabilities for the Apple Watch, although not everything will see the light of day. \"Think about the amount of sensors in your car,\" said Cook, adding \"and arguably, your body is much more important than your car.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tim-cook-on-health-and-fitness/id1090500561?i=1000501826971&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;theme=light\" height=\"175px\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 660px; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 10px; background: transparent;\"></iframe></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/tim-cook-outside-magazine-cover/\">Tim Cook Featured on Outside Magazine Cover, Talks Health and Wellness</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-featured-on-outside-magazine-cover-talks-health-and-wellness.2284128/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_SVqKpj_wRY:PBeexMQzl7s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_SVqKpj_wRY:PBeexMQzl7s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_SVqKpj_wRY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b7d08566f733f01c060cc45ef437aa6cdcfff78b40711f899a0d3b8e120a8c2","category":"Apple"}
