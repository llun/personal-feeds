With over 10,000 miniâ€‘LEDs grouped into more than 2,500 local dimming zones, the display also has an impressive 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/13-inch-macbook-pro-m1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple has so far branded its mini-LED displays as \"XDR\" displays, short for \"Extreme Dynamic Range,\" and rumors suggest the iPad Pro won't be the only Apple device to feature the technology this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTaiwanese research firm TrendForce <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210421-10771.html\">today reported</a> that Apple plans to launch new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with mini-LED displays in the second half of 2021, in line with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/apple-silicon-macbooks-production-report/\">previous reports</a>. The notebooks are expected to be powered by an Apple silicon chip and feature a new design with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">return of an SD card slot and HDMI port</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a lot of anticipation for the new high-end MacBook Pro models, as Apple will likely equip the notebooks with an improved iteration of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1 chip</a>, perhaps with M1X branding or something along those lines. Reputable sources like <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo have also claimed that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">Touch Bar will be replaced with physical function keys</a>, and that a MagSafe magnetic power cable will return.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs of this week, Apple has updated four Mac models with Apple silicon, including the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini. Apple previously said that its transition away from Intel processors would be completed by around WWDC 2022.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/\">TrendForce</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/macbook-pro-xdr-displays-second-half-2021/\">14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With XDR Displays Expected to Launch Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-with-xdr-displays-expected-to-launch-later-this-year.2292589/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kj0p_bs86RE:uW-PYBw6wAk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kj0p_bs86RE:uW-PYBw6wAk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/kj0p_bs86RE\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"775299e844e47d6bcda6b5848a320baed62a2dc22fecdf06651033ec54a97971","category":"Apple"}
