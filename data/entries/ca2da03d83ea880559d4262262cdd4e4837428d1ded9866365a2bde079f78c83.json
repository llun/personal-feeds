Announced last month, ‌Apple Card‌ Family allows families to share a single ‌Apple Card‌ with users above 13 years old with the ability to set a spending limit.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-card-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing its release, Apple has shared two how-to videos on how exactly to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SDIBN5PfMD8\">share an Apple Card with your teenager or friend</a> and how to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EJQjd6CiO9s\">co-own a single Apple Card with your significant other</a>. The process for sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with a friend or teenager is enabled within the Wallet app on iOS 14.6 or later and requires that you be in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Family with the person you wish to share the card with.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month, Apple also announced the ability for couples to co-own a single ‌Apple Card‌, allowing them to build their credit score together. The process is similar to sharing an ‌Apple Card‌ with your teenager or friend but requires you to share your spouse's annual income. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Card‌ Family is available today with the iOS 14.6 update.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/apple-card-family-how-tos/\">Apple Details How to Share an Apple Card and Add A Co-Owner</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-details-how-to-share-an-apple-card-and-add-a-co-owner.2297610/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UxKS-UhT6q8:mwZ8AhwKaNA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UxKS-UhT6q8:mwZ8AhwKaNA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UxKS-UhT6q8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ca2da03d83ea880559d4262262cdd4e4837428d1ded9866365a2bde079f78c83","category":"Apple"}
