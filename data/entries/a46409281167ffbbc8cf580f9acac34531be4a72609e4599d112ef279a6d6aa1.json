Luckily, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/ios-14-adoption-90-percent/\">majority of active iPhones and iPad devices are running iOS 14</a>, meaning the lack of support for older iOS firmware will not impact a significant amount of users.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; update, Reddit also introduced a new \"double tap on images to zoom in\" feature that gives users more ability to zoom into photos, much like the stock <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app on iOS and iPadOS. For users looking for an alternative to the stock Reddit app, Apollo for Reddit remains a popular choice amongst users.
