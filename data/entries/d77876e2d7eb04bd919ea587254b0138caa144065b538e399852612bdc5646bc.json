Set to be organised by ASO, it will be an eight-day race taking place one week after the men's race from 24th July to 31st July – replacing the exisiting one-day La Course.</p>\n<p>But the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed the return of the RideLondon Classique, traditionally a one-day race in the UK that has historically offered the biggest prize pot in women's cycling. However, for 2022, it looks as if the RideLondon Classique will become a stage race with its dates pencilled in for 27th to 29th May, moving from its usual August slot.</p>\n<p>This joins the Women's Tour, scheduled from 6th to 11th June, as the second women's WorldTour stage race to be taking place on British shores next year, making two more than there are men's WorldTour events.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/brompton/9681/brompton-reveals-foo-fighters-bikes-as-charity-auction-begins\">Brompton reveals Foo Fighters bikes as charity auction begins</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9734/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-32-channel-4s-krishnan-guru-murthy\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast Episode 32 – Channel 4's Krishnan Guru-Murthy</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9510/scottish-cyclist-to-attempt-record-for-furthest-distance-cycled-in-a-week\">Scottish cyclist to attempt record for furthest distance cycled in a week</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 114: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nBeyond racing in the UK, the <a href=\"/tags/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a> – commonly known as the Giro Rosa – has returned to WorldTour status having been downgraded to 2.1 status for 2021. Running from 1st to 10th July, it will precede the inaugural women's Tour de France by two weeks.</p>\n<p>The Ladies Tour of Norway has been renamed the Battle of the North, upping from four stages to six, while the Ceratizit Challenge by La Vuelta in September adds a fourth stage. There is also a return for the Postnord Vårgårda WestSweden road race and time-trial on 6th and 7th August.</p>\n<h3>Women's WorldTour races 2022</h3>\n<p>3rd March - Strade Bianche<br />\n13th March - Ronde van Drenthe<br />\n20th March - Trofeo Alfredo Binda - Comune di Cittiglio<br />\n24th March - Oxyclean Classic Brugge-De Panne<br />\n27th March - Gent-Wevelgem In Flanders Fields<br />\n3rd April - Ronde van Vlaanderen - Tour des Flandres<br />\n10th April - Paris-Roubaix Femmes<br />\n17th April - Amstel Gold Race Ladies Edition<br />\n20th April - La Flèche Wallonne Féminine<br />\n24th April - Liège-Bastogne-Liège Femmes<br />\n5th-7th May - Tour of Chongming Island<br />\n13th-15th May - Itzulia Women<br />\n19th-22nd May - Vuelta a Burgos Feminas<br />\n27th-29th May - RideLondon Classique<br />\n6th-11th June - Women's Tour<br />\n1st-10th July - Giro d'Italia Donne<br />\n24th-31st July - Tour de France Femmes<br />\n6th August - Postnord Vårgårda WestSweden TTT<br />\n7th August - Postnord Vårgårda WestSweden RR<br />\n9th-14th August - Battle of the North<br />\n27th August - GP Lorient Agglomération - Trophée Ceratizit <br />\n30th August - September 4 Boels Ladies Tour<br />\n8th-11th September - Ceratizit Challenge by La Vuelta<br />\n18th October - Tour of Guangxi </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d77876e2d7eb04bd919ea587254b0138caa144065b538e399852612bdc5646bc","category":"Cycling"}
