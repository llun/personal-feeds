Together with the Jumbo-Visma team staff, the Slovenian made the decision following Saturday’s first mountain test. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We made this choice together”, Roglic said. “It doesn’t make sense to continue this way. Now it’s time to recover and focus on my new goals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/primoz-roglic-loses-time-after-taking-a-hard-fall-on-stage-3-of-the-tour-de-france/\">crashed</a> on stage 3, landing hard on his coccyx and losing a lot of skin. He continued the Tour wrapped in bandages, and though his seventh-place finish in the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/tadej-pogacar-wins-stage-5-of-the-tour-de-france/\">stage 5</a> time trial looked promising, he struggled on Friday’s longest stage of the race and finished in the gruppetto on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/dylan-teuns-wins-stage-8-of-the-tour-de-france/\">stage 8</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about the injuries he sustained in his crash and whether he thought it affected his chances of reaching Paris, Roglič was pragmatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I never look that far ahead, I’m just trying to be in the moment. After a couple of days I saw that I was getting nowhere and it doesn’t make any sense to continue. Even though I surprised myself in the time trial, the day after I was feeling bad again with a lot of pain. In the time trial, somehow I really went over myself, I really pushed myself, but with the more normal hard stages, it’s too much for my body at the moment and I could not race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am very disappointed, but I have to accept it as it is. I remain optimistic and look forward to new goals.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/primoz-roglic-withdraws-from-the-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1e6550f5638438be6430f56924bb65f5b75f9050639a0fc492adf96d1bf5a8ef","category":"Cycling"}
