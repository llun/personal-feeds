Whether you’re using a pair of AirPods\nPro or AirPods Max, the software that powers the feature will\nwiden the soundstage so that it seems like the entire room you’re\nin is being filled with sound. When you sit down to watch a movie\nor TV show, the included head tracking feature will lock in after\nit detects you’ve been looking in the same direction for a while.\nOnce you get up to walk around, it will reactivate.
