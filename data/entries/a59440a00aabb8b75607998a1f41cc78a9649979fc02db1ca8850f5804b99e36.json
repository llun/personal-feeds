{"title":"Goodyear adds new gravel tire models and sizes, goes deeper with tanwall","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/goodyear-adds-new-gravel-tire-models-and-sizes-goes-deeper-with-tanwall/","date":1613034083000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/04/goodyear-bicycle-tires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Goodyear’s collection</a> of gravel tire tread designs has grown by one with the addition of the Peak, a more open-treaded pattern adapted from the mountain bike tire of the same name. The Peak is the most XC-oriented of that bunch, though, and so the relatively low-profile knobs, the ramped leading edges, and tight spacing are still meant to help reduce rolling resistance while improving traction on looser surfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new gravel-focused Peak is being offered solely in a 700x40c size with a 120 tpi &#8220;Tubeless Complete&#8221; casing. Claimed weight is &#8220;to be determined&#8221;, and retail price is US$64 / £43 / €50.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-Peak-1-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-480291\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-Peak-1-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-Peak-1-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-Peak-1-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-Peak-1-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-Peak-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The Peak tread design is adapted from the company&#8217;s mountain bike collection, but in sizes that are better suited for drop-bar bikes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The versatile Connector and the more smoothly treaded County gravel models carry over, but Goodyear is adding a bunch of new sizes to both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the Connector was originally only offered in a 700x40c size, there’s now a 700x35c for riders that want something a little narrower and lighter, plus new 700x50c and 650x50c options for riders that want more volume. Meanwhile, the County used to only come in 700x35c, but now there’s a 700x40c and 650x50c as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-County-1-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-480281\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-County-1-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-County-1-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-County-1-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-County-1-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Goodyear-County-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The County features a smooth-rolling center tread with a progressively more aggressive shoulder that should play well on poorly paved tarmac and light-duty dirt.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the gravel tires are offered exclusively with Tubeless Complete 120 tpi casings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claimed weight for the 700x40c Connector is 515 g; weight for the County is TBD.
