However, a specific price and launch date have not been announced. Right now, an ad-free subscription to <a href=\"https://www.hbomax.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HBO Max</a> costs $14.99 monthly in the United States.</p>\n<p>There is one major catch, though: the ad-supported version of the service will not stream the much-hyped Warner Bros theatrical releases. Those films include <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/wonder-woman-1984-will-reach-theaters-hbo-max-the-same-day-december-25/\"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a>, which showed simultaneously on HBO Max and in theaters in December of 2020, and <em>Dune</em>, which is expected to premiere this year.</p>\n<p>HBO will join Paramount+, Hulu, and some other streaming services in offering (at least) two tiers—one relatively low-cost one that involves pre-roll or mid-roll advertising, and one with a higher monthly fee that involves no ads. Still, some of HBO Max's competitors, like Disney+ or Netflix, do not do sold advertising at all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749268#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749268&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"95ebf8cb73a0a7887c420e0722440e27431110b3a5f61b2e285b428b8d9c70d4","category":"Tech"}
