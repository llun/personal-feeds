Production on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series)\">the new show</a>, which stars Jared Harris and Lee Pace, shut down last March along with everything else, although filming resumed last October. No official air date besides \"late 2021\" has surfaced, but there are a few tantalizing extra glimpses in the streaming platform's new summer (and beyond) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1fI8BL7BnE\">preview trailer</a>, per the eagle eye of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSpaceshipper/status/1402306832018849793?s=20\">The Spaceshipper on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mild spoilers for the first book in the <em>Foundation</em> series below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/apple-drops-first-teaser-trailer-for-tv-adaption-of-asimovs-foundation-series/\">I've written previously</a>, the series started as eight short stories by Asimov that appeared in Astounding Magazine between 1942 and early 1950. Those stories were inspired in part by Edward Gibbons' <em>History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>, and the first four were collected, along with a new introductory story, and published as <em>Foundation</em> in 1951. The next pair of stories became <em>Foundation and Empire</em> (1952), and the final two stories appearing in 1953's <em>Second Foundation</em>. Asimov's publishers eventually convinced him to continue the series, starting with two sequels: <em>Foundation's Edge</em> (1982) and <em>Foundation and Earth</em> (1986). Next came a pair of prequels: <em>Prelude to Foundation</em> (1988) and <em>Forward the Foundation</em> (1993), the latter published posthumously (Asimov died in 1992). </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771482#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73393e71544f8f8b806870f1d117b7fe6771ee2a6470e5751fc2bc6691346c65","category":"Tech"}
