Thanks to a strong push from Apple, TSMC now has its eyes set on 140,000 to 150,000 monthly chip waters from the second to the fourth quarter of the year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEven though the new ‌iPad Pro‌ and 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> were announced this week, they won't begin shipping until the second half of May. The significant delay between announcement and shipments is likely due to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/ipad-macbook-production-postponed-nikkei/\">strain put on Apple's suppliers</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nResearch cited by another <em>DigiTimes</em> <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210422PD207.html\">report</a> today suggests that the new higher-end 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ which features a new Liquid Retina XDR Display, will reach 5 million shipments this year. The new ‌iPad Pro‌ and 24-inch ‌iMac‌ will be available for pre-order starting Friday, April 30.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/apple-ramping-up-m1-production/\">Apple Ramping Up M1 Production as New 12.9-inch iPad Pro Expected to Reach Five Million Shipments in 2021</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ramping-up-m1-production-as-new-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-expected-to-reach-five-million-shipments-in-2021.2292741/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NCr6UJAgNAk:PMl3MIhs79I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NCr6UJAgNAk:PMl3MIhs79I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NCr6UJAgNAk\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"347d455f985a1641a1dc9eabc68c3b192424c68ddcd783f2cdca72af127b9893","category":"Apple"}
