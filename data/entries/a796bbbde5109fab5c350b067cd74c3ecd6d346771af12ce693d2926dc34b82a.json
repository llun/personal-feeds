Apple previously marketed the Pro Display XDR as featuring P3 wide color gamut without any caveats, however following the complaint, the company has added a footnote to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/pro-display-xdr/\">product page in the UK</a> to indicate it \"supports 99% of the P3 wide color gamut.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/p3-wide-color-change.png\" /><div><em>9to5Mac (Change in Pro Display XDR website following complaint)</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally, UK customers complained to the ASA regarding Apple's use of the term \"Far beyond HDR.\" The complaints, alleging it to be misleading, caused Apple to remove it entirely from the product page in the UK. The Pro Display XDR marketing remains unchanged in the US.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-adjusts-pro-display-xdr-marketing/\">Apple Adjusts Pro Display XDR Marketing in UK Following Complaints of Misleading Claims</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adjusts-pro-display-xdr-marketing-in-uk-following-complaints-of-misleading-claims.2291446/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vZGMprANllQ:lgjOyWtTKJc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vZGMprANllQ:lgjOyWtTKJc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vZGMprANllQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a796bbbde5109fab5c350b067cd74c3ecd6d346771af12ce693d2926dc34b82a","category":"Apple"}
