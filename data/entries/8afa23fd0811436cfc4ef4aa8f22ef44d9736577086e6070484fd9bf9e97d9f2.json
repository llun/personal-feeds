During a <a href=\"https://www.summergamefest.com/\">streaming Summer Game Fest event</a>Â on Thursday, publisher Bandai Namco showed the first gameplay footage from this collaboration between <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/dark-souls/\"><em>Dark Souls</em></a> creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and <em>Game of Thrones</em> scribe George R.R. Martin and announced a release date of January 21, 2022, for \"next-gen and current-gen\" consoles.</p>\n<p>The trailer below (and the screenshots above) speak for themselves, and the <em>Dark Souls</em> vibes are apparent throughout. That means a lot of dodge-rolling out of the way of some massive attacks from beasts many times the player's size, including a prominent dragon. It also means lots of dramatic magical effects, including telekensis, fire, and thrown stone amid the vaguely medieval setting.</p>\n<p>A voiceover gives some hints about the \"tarnished\" protagonist, who has returned \"in search of the Elden Ring, emboldened by the flame of ambition.\" The protagonist is shown summoning a ghostly horse and fighting against mounted enemies. At one point, the mount leaps straight up a sheer cliffside. It looks like you can also summon a ghostly companion to fight alongside you to attack from multiple angles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772252#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772252&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8afa23fd0811436cfc4ef4aa8f22ef44d9736577086e6070484fd9bf9e97d9f2","category":"Tech"}
