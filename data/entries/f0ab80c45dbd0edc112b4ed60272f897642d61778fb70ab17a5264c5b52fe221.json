Simon Lancaster, filed today in United States district court in California:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Plaintiff Apple Inc. (“Apple”) brings this action to stop the\nmisappropriation of Apple’s trade secrets by its former employee\nSimon Lancaster.</p>\n\n<p>Despite over a decade of employment at Apple, Lancaster abused his\nposition and trust within the company to systematically\ndisseminate Apple’s sensitive trade secret information in an\neffort to obtain personal benefits. He used his seniority to gain\naccess to internal meetings and documents outside the scope of his\njob’s responsibilities containing Apple’s trade secrets, and he\nprovided these trade secrets to his outside media correspondent\n(“Correspondent”). The Correspondent then published the stolen\ntrade secrets in articles, citing a “source” at Apple. On multiple\noccasions, Lancaster proposed that the Correspondent give benefits\nto Lancaster in exchange for Apple’s trade secrets. For example,\nLancaster proposed that the Correspondent provide favorable\ncoverage of a startup company in which Lancaster was an investor\nas a quid pro quo. Lancaster even recruited the Correspondent to\nserve as his personal investigator. In one instance, Lancaster\nrequested that the Correspondent explore a rumor that could prove\nharmful to a company in which Lancaster had invested. […]</p>\n\n<p>On October 10, 2019, the Correspondent requested additional\nconfidential information from Lancaster related to another\nunannounced Apple project referred to herein as “Project X.”</p>\n\n<p>On October 15, 2019, Lancaster submitted his resignation to Apple,\nand he began off-boarding from his roles within the company. […]\nOn October 16, 2019, the Correspondent asked Lancaster “can you\ngrab me those docs before you leave”? Lancaster responded “which\nones,” and the Correspondent then identified specific Apple\nconfidential documents that they wanted Lancaster to\nmisappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Later that month, Lancaster informed the Correspondent that he\nintended to attend a meeting regarding Project X. […] Prior to\nthe time Lancaster attended the Project X meeting, he was\ninstructed by Apple that he should not attend the meeting,\nespecially given his announced departure. Additional Apple\npersonnel told Lancaster during the meeting that he should not be\npresent. Lancaster eventually left the meeting, but he learned\nsubstantial SAI regarding Project X before leaving. Lancaster\nwrote to one of his managers who had instructed him that he should\nnot be in the meeting that “I had already been exposed to all the\nhardware they showed while I was in the [meeting]. Was just hoping\nto see a demo.” On information and belief, this communication by\nLancaster was intended to disguise his efforts to misappropriate\nApple trade secrets regarding Project X.</p>\n\n<p>On information and belief, Lancaster transmitted the trade secret\nSAI gleaned from this meeting to the Correspondent on the same day\nthe meeting occurred. […]</p>\n\n<p>November 1, 2019 was Lancaster’s final day of employment at Apple\nand his credentials to log into the secure Apple corporate network\nwere set to expire at midnight. But at 10:24 p.m. that same day,\nLancaster used his credentials to log onto Apple’s secure\ncorporate network from a location outside Apple facilities. On\ninformation and belief, Lancaster used this access to download\nadditional SAI before his login credentials expired. In\nparticular, Lancaster downloaded confidential information that\nwould assist his new employer.</p>\n\n<p>Mere days after Lancaster’s final day at Apple, Lancaster had a\ncall with the Correspondent and later congratulated the\nCorrespondent about the success of an article that disclosed SAI\nthat Lancaster had misappropriated in his final weeks of\nemployment at Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Project X could be anything, but <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-over-device-leaks-to-media\">it sure sounds like</a> Apple’s VR/AR glasses project. There just aren’t that many secret Apple projects that have been written about, and Project X does not sound like Project Titan (the car). There aren’t that many candidates for the “correspondent”, either. The Information ran a piece bylined by Wayne Ma, Alex Heath, and Nick Wingfield on 11 November 2019, “<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses\">Apple Eyes 2022 Release for AR Headset, 2023 for Glasses</a>”. That seems like it’s stretching the meaning of “mere days” after Lancaster’s November 1 departure.</p>\n\n<p>Then there’s Bloomberg, which ran a piece solo bylined by Mark Gurman on 21 October 2019, “<a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:I5lCdOUj_zgJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-21/why-2020-is-looking-great-for-apple-products-and-consumer-gadgets+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari\">Apple’s Smart Glasses Could Make 2020 the Year of AR</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Such applications are central to Apple’s long-awaited AR glasses,\nwhich are expected to have holographic displays in their lenses.\nApple has targeted 2020 for the release of its AR headset, an\nattempt to succeed where Google Glass failed years ago. The\nglasses are expected to synchronize with a wearer’s iPhone to\ndisplay things such as texts, emails, maps, and games over the\nuser’s field of vision. The company has considered including an\nApp Store with the headset, as it does on Apple TV streaming\ndevices and the Apple Watch. It’s hiring experts in graphics and\ngame development to establish the glasses as the leader in a new\nproduct category and, if all goes perfectly, an eventual successor\nto the iPhone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Sues Former Employee for Leaking Trade Secrets to Unnamed ‘Media Correspondent’ (PDF)’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-for-leaking\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f0ab80c45dbd0edc112b4ed60272f897642d61778fb70ab17a5264c5b52fe221","category":"Tech"}
