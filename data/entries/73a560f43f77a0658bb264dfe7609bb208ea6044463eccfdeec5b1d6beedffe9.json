The move seems likely to further encourage some investors who <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/gamestop-the-stock-and-gamestop-the-retailer-continue-to-be-worlds-apart/\">continue to be bullish on GameStop stock</a> and see Cohen's plans to \"transform\" the retailer as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/\">a key part of its recent sky-high rise in valuation</a>.\n<p>Cohen, who <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/4/18/15339208/petsmart-chewy-acquisition-price-3-35-billion\">sold pet-supplies retailer Chewy to PetSmart for $3.5 billion in 2017</a>, has traditionally been cautious with his investing strategy, putting money into big, safe stocks like Apple and Wells Fargo.
