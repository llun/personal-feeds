That’s great if you’ve been waiting for a specific high-priced Apple product there’s something specific you’ve wanted, but sorting through the hundreds of products available for sale can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of giving you another list of things on sale, we’ve put together three bundles of products that work great together and uncovered hundreds of dollars in savings in the process. We’ve got something for everything, whether you’re a Mac, iPhone, or iPad user, and of course, all of the prices here are at or near the lowest we’ve ever seen and you can even mix and match and still put together a killer bundle. So go get saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power Mac bundle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has some great savings on M1 Macs during Prime Day, but what’s a new Mac without some new great to go with it. This bundle scores you an incredible LG monitor and a whopping 5TB hard drive so you’ll never run out of space.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Mac mini (M1, 512GB):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2020-Apple-Mini-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$780 ($120 off)</a></li><li><strong>LG 27GL83A-B 27 Inch Ultragear QHD Display:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LG-27GL83A-B-Ultragear-Compatible-Monitor/dp/B07YGZL8XF?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$285 ($95 off)</a></li><li><strong>SAMSUNG T5 Portable SSD 2TB:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VNTFHD5?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$190 ($90 off)</a></li></ol><p><strong>Total cost: </strong>$1,255</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total savings: </strong>$305</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mobile gaming bundle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon hasn’t discounted any iPhones during its Prime Day extravaganza, but that doesn’t mean Apple’s handset is completely shut out of the discounts. iPhone lovers have a plethora of cases and accessories to choose from, but we couldn’t pass up these three products for gamers, including a transforming controller and a giant power bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Razer Kishi Mobile Game Controller / Gamepad for iPhone:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Controller-Gamepad-iPhone-mac/dp/B08FFPKRYW/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$66.49 ($33.50 off)</a></li><li><strong>Anker PowerCore III Elite 25600 Power Bank with 65W PD Charger:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Charger-Delivery-Portable/dp/B08537MKBS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$96 ($64 off)</a></li><li><strong>AirPods Pro:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$190 ($59 off)</a></li></ol><p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $352.50</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total savings:</strong> $156.50</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ultimate iPad bundle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad is one of Apple’s best it-just-works-out-of-the-box devices, and Prime Day brought big savings across the entire line. We recommend the iPad Air as the best of the bunch, but there are a few things you’re going to need to unlock its full potential, including a dock and an eero Wi-Fi 6 router to get the fastest speeds possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>iPad Air: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J61FCVN/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$520 ($79 off)</a></li><li><strong>eero 6 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi 6 router + extender:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B085WS7H6K/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$129 ($70 off)</a></li><li><strong>Plugable USB C Hub Multiport 7-in-1 Adapter:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B08BLXG7C1?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$21.56 $5.39 off</a></li></ol><p><strong>Total cost:</strong> $670.56</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total savings:</strong> $154.39</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"34dd056620218fd792b3e29607dd092507cd02a1925e15a14528afd4ab25f74d","category":"Apple"}
