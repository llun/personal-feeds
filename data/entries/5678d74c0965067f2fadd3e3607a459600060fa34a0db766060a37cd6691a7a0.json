As discovered by Techmeme editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpencerDailey/status/1359647988172419072\">Spencer Dailey</a>, when you go to log into a new account in the Gmail app for iOS, it gives a warning that you should update and suggests that you only continue with the sign in \"if you understand the risks.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nUnfortunately, there is no update available for the Gmail app. Version 6.0.201115 of the Gmail app is the only available version of Gmail on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and it hasn't been updated since December 1.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-ios-apps-privacy-labels-update/\">on January 5</a> claimed that it would be adding privacy data to its app catalog \"this week or next week,\" but by January 20, most apps <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/google-ios-apps-still-no-privacy-labels/\">still had not been updated</a> with the App Privacy labels.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle has since quietly been adding labels to apps like YouTube, but major apps like Gmail, Google Search, Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, Google Maps, and others still do not have privacy details. Even in apps that have gained with labels, there have been no feature or security updates for the most part.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt continues to be unclear why Google is taking so long to add App Privacy labels to its iOS apps, and there's no word yet on when Gmail will get an update. Google has been regularly <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">updating its Android apps</a>, and the last update for the Android Gmail app was released on February 9.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere has been speculation that Google is hesitant to provide the privacy label data because of the negative feedback that other companies like Facebook have received, but there's still no confirmed explanation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Got a finger cramp scrolling through Facebook&#39;s new privacy section on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;… <a href=\"https://t.co/QVWAhN1Dxe\">pic.twitter.com/QVWAhN1Dxe</a></p>&mdash; MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1338941005261901833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nApp Privacy labels have been required since iOS 14.3 and are designed to provide customers with details about what data an app collects from them so they can make an informed choice when opting to install an app. App developers are required to self-report privacy information in the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌, and developers must identify all data collection and use cases.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<b>Update:</b> Google has pushed a server side update that removes the out of date warning when attempting to sign into a new account in the Gmail app.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gmail/\">Gmail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/gmail-ios-out-of-date-warning/\">Gmail iOS App Has Out of Date Warning After 2 Months of No Updates as Google Delays Privacy Labels [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gmail-ios-app-has-out-of-date-warning-after-2-months-of-no-updates-as-google-delays-privacy-labels-updated.2284207/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UOiy9juGBXI:lAv2c4IgKg0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UOiy9juGBXI:lAv2c4IgKg0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UOiy9juGBXI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5678d74c0965067f2fadd3e3607a459600060fa34a0db766060a37cd6691a7a0","category":"Apple"}
