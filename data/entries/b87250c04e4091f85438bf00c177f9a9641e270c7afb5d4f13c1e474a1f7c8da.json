Ballots in favor of a union\ntrailed at 738, less than 30 percent of the votes tallied,\naccording to a preliminary count. The results will still need to\nbe certified by federal officials.</p>\n\n<p>The lopsided outcome at the 6,000-person warehouse in Bessemer,\nAla., dealt a crushing blow to labor organizers, Democrats and\ntheir allies at a time when conditions have been ripe for unions\nto make advances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m not surprised this unionization drive failed, but I’m a little surprised the vote was so lopsided.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/09/amazon-union-drive\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b87250c04e4091f85438bf00c177f9a9641e270c7afb5d4f13c1e474a1f7c8da","category":"Tech"}
