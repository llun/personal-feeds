After 146km on the volcanic island of Tenerife, the seven-time Grand Tour champion gave us a glimpse into his world.</p>\n<p>It’s 27 songs long. There's no common thread, no overarching genre or even a consistency of rhythm conducive to high intensity workout – just  27 individual songs that made me progressively ponder ‘does Chris Froome really like this song?’</p>\n<p>Now, I will be honest, Chris Froome always struck me as the kind of guy who doesn’t really like music. Actually, no, let me rephrase that. Froome seemed like the kind of person that when asked tells you ‘he likes all types of music, really’ which is an absolute red flag for somebody who doesn’t actually like music or at the very least doesn’t care too much about it.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race plus daily photo galleries</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9653/gallery-bernal-tightens-maglia-rosa-grip-on-monte-zoncolan\">Gallery: Bernal tightens Maglia Rosa grip on Monte Zoncolan </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 114: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAnd there’s nothing wrong with not liking music. While I don’t understand, it’s better than using it as a personality trait (isn’t that right Wiggo?). But colour me wrong. He does like music, apparently, and here is the proof.</p>\n<p>We’ve critiqued, analysed, inspected and investigated almost every aspect of Froome’s life since he burst onto the scene at the 2011 <a href=\"/tags/vuelta-a-espana\">Vuelta a Espana</a> so it makes complete and utter sense for us to do the same with this playlist.</p>\n<p>So over the weekend we listened to all 27 songs while out on a ride and have decided to rate them below:</p>\n<h3>1. Tiësto - God Is A Dancer (with Mabel)</h3>\n<p>\nPoor start from Froome, here. This sounds like 95% of the charts right now. Insert vocalist known by only their first name, 120BPM generic backing track and some exotic drums... record. I'd forgotten this song as soon as it had finished. <strong>2/10</strong></p>\n<h3>2. Carly Rae Jepsen - Call Me Maybe</h3>\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEvX_vKDYEw\" target=\"_blank\">2012 Orica-GreenEdge Vuelta a Espana team</a>, enough said. <strong>7/10</strong></p>\n<h3>3. WALK THE MOON - Shut Up and Dance</h3>\n<p>\nChris, 35, professional bike rider from Nairobi. Loves pina coladas and getting caught in the rain. Free spirit. <strong>5/10</strong></p>\n<h3>4. Kelly Clarkson - Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)</h3>\n<p>\nChris Froome is a strong, independant bike rider who doesn’t need no Ineos Grenadiers. <strong>6/10</strong></p>\n<h3>5. Jessie J - Domino</h3>\n<p>\n‘You got me losing my mind/My heart beats out of time/I'm seeing Hollywood stars/You strum me like a guitar.’ Blimey, Chris. <strong>7/10</strong></p>\n<h3>6. Mark Ronson - Uptown Funk (feat. Bruno Mars)</h3>\n<p>\nIt’s the summer of 2015. Uptown Funk is being played constantly, Great Britain is still in the European Union, everyone rides rim brakes and Chris Froome is at the absolute peak of his powers. Oh how he wishes he could go back and live it all again. <strong>6/10</strong></p>\n<h3>7. Owl City ft. Carly Rae Jepsen - Good Time</h3>\n<p>\nCarly Rae Jepsen features on this list three times so I think it’s fair to assume Chris Froome’s favourite music artist is Carly Rae Jepsen. <strong>4/10</strong></p>\n<h3>8. Carly Rae Jepsen - I Really Like You</h3>\n<p>\nHonestly, has Chris Froome single-handidly funded Jepsen’s career? <strong>6/10</strong></p>\n<h3>9. The Wanted - Glad You Came</h3>\n<p>\nHow does Chris Froome know who The Wanted are? He grew up in Africa and lives in Monaco. The Wanted never made it past the Watford Gap. Must have been recommended by Ian Stannard or something. <strong>7</strong><strong>/10</strong></p>\n<h3>10. Sophie Ellis-Bextor - Murder On The Dancefloor</h3>\n<p>\nNow we’re talking. A stone-cold classic from the absolute Queen of Lockdown thanks to her livestreamed kitchen disco parties. Things are looking up on this playlist suddenly.<strong> 9/10</strong></p>\n<h3>11. Olly Murs - Troublemaker (feat. Flo Rida)</h3>\n<p>\nLook up ‘cheeky chappy’ in the dictionary and you will see a picture of Olly Murs, fedora and all, staring back at you. The Esteban Chaves of the music industry. <strong>4/10</strong></p>\n<h3>12. Sugababes - Push The Button</h3>\n<p>\nAlongside Girls Aloud, the Sugababes are the most influential female pop group to have come from the UK in the past fifty years so I have a lot of time for this choice. <strong>8/10</strong></p>\n<h3>13. Jack Johnson - Better Together</h3>\n<p>\nPeople who like Jack Johnson also like to wear flip-flops with jeans and I think that’s all we need to say about that. <strong>5/10</strong></p>\n<h3>14. Matt Simons - We Can Do Better</h3>\n<p>\nThis was one of only two songs throughout the playlist that I hadn’t heard before and I’m pretty annoyed this still isn’t the case. <strong>2/10</strong></p>\n<h3>15. Daniel Bedingfield - Gotta Get Thru This - D'N'D Radio Edit</h3>\n<p>\nNever had Froomey down as a Garage head. Rate that, to be fair. This song always goes off. You know who I reckon also likes garage music, Dan Martin. <strong>8/10</strong></p>\n<h3>16. The Fray - How to Save a Life</h3>\n<p>\nAlright Chris, way to kill the mood. <strong>4/10</strong></p>\n<h3>17. Charming Horses - Higher Love (feat. Grace Grundy)</h3>\n<p>\nThis is a terrible song. <strong>1/10</strong></p>\n<h3>18. Five - Keep On Movin'</h3>\n<p>\nI see Froomey’s been to a school disco or two in his time. Couple cans of pop and a glowstick or five. Reckon he absolutely loved a knee slide, too. <strong>8/10</strong></p>\n<h3>19. The Verve - Bitter Sweet Symphony</h3>\n<p>\nI don’t know why but this feels like a dig at Bradley Wiggins. <strong>7/10</strong></p>\n<h3>20. Coolio - Gangsta's Paradise</h3>\n<p>\n‘Yeah, I love Hip-Hop. Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer, PJ and Duncan. And that Coolio fella, can’t get enough’. <strong>3/10</strong></p>\n<h3>21. Los Lobos - La Bamba</h3>\n<p>\nThis is taking me a lot longer than I thought it would, if I’m being honest.<strong> 3/10</strong></p>\n<h3>22. Kid Rock - All Summer Long</h3>\n<p>\nTell me you hate music without telling me you hate music. <strong>3/10</strong></p>\n<h3>23. The Buggles - Video Killed The Radio Star</h3>\n<p>\nI bet you didn’t know Buggles lead singer Trevor Horn went on to win a Grammy for his production of Seal’s 1994 hit Kiss from a Rose? Well, now you do. <strong>6/10</strong></p>\n<h3>24. Mr. President - Coco Jamboo</h3>\n<p>\nAn 11-year-old Froome dancing around his bedroom while listening to Mr.President on a Sony Walkman cassette player dreaming of 70km solo raids to win the Giro d’Italia. <strong>7/10</strong></p>\n<h3>25. Tal Bachman - She's So High</h3>\n<p>\nI’d never heard of this song before so I did a little research into it. It reached number 3 in the Canadian charts and was a top 10 hit in New Zealand. There we are. <strong>4/10</strong></p>\n<h3>26. Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit</h3>\n<p>\nI’m not surprised that Smells Like Teen Spirit made the list but I am surprised that Savage Garden’s Truly Madly Deeply did not. <strong>5/10</strong></p>\n<h3>27. Phil Collins - Two Hearts</h3>\n<p>\nAnd the cockney bongo miracle saves the day. Have you listened to the soundtracks to <em>Buster</em>, <em>Tarzan</em> and <em>Brother Bear</em>? Nobody asked him to go that hard for film soundtracks. Phil Collins is nothing short of a lyrical soul angel and should be protected at all costs. <strong>10/10</strong> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"036cd68decc8394ecdf569c9e6dd8461fa317f21ca4b3086674edf53534a2462","category":"Cycling"}
