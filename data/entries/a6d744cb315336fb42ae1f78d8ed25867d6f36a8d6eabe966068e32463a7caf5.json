And that's just the start.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/specialized/9430/specialized-como-sl-images#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 10</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/03/20200709_specialized_er_0612.jpg?itok=ahliHG83\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>10</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<h3>The hero you deserve</h3>\n<p>There are actually two bikes within the Como SL group, the 4.0 and 5.0. They both have hydraulic disc brakes, integrated lights, internal cable routing and 650b wheels alongside the SL 1.1 system, mudguards, pannier-compatible rear rack and basket.</p>\n<p>What sets the 5.0 apart from its numerically challenged sibling is mainly in the drivetrain. The 5.0 is equipped with an eight speed internal gear hub and a Gates Belt Drive that allows for shifting while stopped and requires minimal maintenance as it doesn't need standard lube and oil.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rutlandcycling.com/facetresults.aspx?Term=Como%20SL\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy a Specialized Como SL e-bike from Rutland Cycling

maintenance than most bikes, but not quite as little as the belt drive offered by the 5.0.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/specialized/9430/specialized-como-sl-images#3\"><p><span>Image 4

</span>10</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>The bikes have three assistance modes: Eco, Sport and Turbo, with each offering support or peak power adjustments as the 320Wh battery can support what Specialized calls '2x you rider amplification', meaning it can nearly double (180%) your output – although legal limits in the UK stop it assisting past 15mph/25kmh.</p>\n<p>Como SL's Ground Control Geometry sits the rider in an upright position, which allows for easy handling and improved peripheral vision.</p>\n<p>Finally, Specialized says each Como SL can carry double its weight, 20kg via the two rear pannier points and 15kg in the front basket – which is removable.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/specialized/9430/specialized-como-sl-images#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 10</p><img
