Sightings Almost Certainly Aren’t Aliens","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/opinion/ufo-sightings-report.html","date":1622481729000,"content":"\n<p>Adam Frank, professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester, in a column for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are also common-sense objections. If we are being frequently\nvisited by aliens, why don’t they just land on the White House\nlawn and announce themselves? There is a recurring narrative,\nperhaps best exemplified by the TV show <em>The X-Files</em>, that these\ncreatures have some mysterious reason to remain hidden from us.\nBut if the mission of these aliens calls for stealth, they seem\nsurprisingly incompetent. You would think that creatures\ntechnologically capable of traversing the mind-boggling distances\nbetween the stars would also know how to turn off their high beams\nat night and to elude our primitive infrared cameras.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exactly. It makes no sense that an alien civilization with the technology for faster-than-light space travel would lack the ability to remain hidden from us, if they so chose. (Same argument goes 100× for any claims that alien ships ever crashed on Earth.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/31/ufo-sightings\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"df0fcd5dd9ce3a5055081d397663b69ed197341ac21c34d21d69a0941ca1cb30","category":"Tech"}
