This allows you to stream audio from a TV-connected game console or other set-top box straight to Apple's smart speakers. Keep reading to learn more and how to set it up.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/PS5-AppleTV-and-HomePod-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌Apple TV‌ 4K supports two additional connection standards, called ARC and eARC. ARC (Audio Return Channel) is a feature of HDMI 1.4 that enables audio from a device to be sent to a compatible TV and relayed through its HDMI port to a separate audio receiver, speaker, or sound bar. eARC (enhanced ARC) meanwhile adds support for the passthrough of higher bandwidth audio like Dolby Atmos, as well as 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, ARC and eARC support effectively allows a ‌HomePod‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/create-homepod-mini-stereo-pair/\">stereo-paired Homepods</a> in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/set-up-home-theater-audio-homepod-apple-tv-4k/\">Home Theater Audio setup</a> to play audio from other TV-connected devices like a cable box, PS5, or Xbox Series X. The following steps show you how to get it set up. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNote that the feature only works with the original, discontinued ‌HomePod‌ – the newer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> is not supported at this time. Also, make sure that your TV supports ARC or eARC. You can check if it does by seeing if there's an ARC label next to your HDMI port, or try contacting the TV manufacturer.\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>On your ‌Apple TV‌, launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Select <strong>Video and Audio</strong>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Select <strong>Default Audio Output</strong>. (Under \"Default Audio Output,\" make sure ‌HomePod‌ is selected.) </li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Under \"Audio Return Channel (Beta),\" select <strong>Play Television Audio</strong>. You'll know ARC or eARC is turned on when it says On (ARC) or On (eARC).</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/tvos14-settings-video-audio-default-audio-output-homepod-selected.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf ARC or eARC doesn't work for you after following the above steps, check whether you need to turn on ARC, eARC, or HDMI-CEC in the settings of your TV. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/play-audio-from-tv-inputs-homepod-apple-tv/\">Apple TV 4K: How to Stream Audio From Your TV's Inputs to HomePod (eARC)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-4k-how-to-stream-audio-from-your-tvs-inputs-to-homepod-earc.2297027/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Trh0unO4aLo:D-hg0EJFcMc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Trh0unO4aLo:D-hg0EJFcMc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Trh0unO4aLo\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc164e726247ec9e6b10fae5743811677436a13fb2518e3a2fc02348dd7b117c","category":"Apple"}
