I made this because I don’t want a\nrecommendation algorithm to tell me what to read, I just want to\nknow when my favorite authors release new books.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a great idea. Make something cool and share it with the world.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Bookfeed.io’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/17/bookfeed\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b310df28dada646612df5a4162ebb3921c3ed3b303172f471e9a1feafe73c40a","category":"Tech"}
