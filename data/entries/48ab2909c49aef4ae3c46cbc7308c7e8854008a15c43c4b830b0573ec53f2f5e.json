This summer that theme is sardines. Inspired by the laid-back vibes of Portugal’s seaside villages, the Sardine Collection taps into the rich Portuguese seafaring tradition and passion for handcrafted arts, like block printing and ceramics. Included in this collection is a jersey, socks, gloves, a bottle, and a cap.
