When we talk about the best way to watch TV, I sort of think about it at three levels,\" Twerdahl said. Those three levels, according to Twerdahl, are hardware specs that deliver the best experience possible, having content that people want, and seamless integration with other Apple products.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTwerdahl said Apple's focus with gaming has been on Apple Arcade, which he also said delivers a tremendous value, but he admitted that the new Apple TV 4K is not designed to compete directly with consoles like the Xbox or PlayStation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"Our focus on gaming has been more recently on arcade stuff, because we think that that's a great value for customers, there's a tremendous amount of content in there,\" said Twerdahl. \"And we've done a lot to make that experience fantastic. Most notably, probably support for all these different game controllers.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"It's probably not designed to compete directly with the Xboxes and PlayStations of the world,\" added Twerdahl. \"They bring something to the market that I think is unique and great for really hardcore gamers.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple Arcade is Apple's subscription-based gaming service, providing access to a catalog of over 100 games without ads or in-app purchases across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, with pricing set at $4.99 per month. The recent tvOS 14.5 update added support for the latest PS5 and Xbox Series X game controllers on the Apple TV.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Apple TV 4K has been available to order since April 30, with most orders beginning to arrive this Friday, May 21.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/20/apple-says-new-apple-tv-is-tremendous-value/\">Apple Says New Apple TV 4K is Tremendous Value at $179, Not Designed to Compete Directly With Xbox or PlayStation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-new-apple-tv-4k-is-tremendous-value-at-179-not-designed-to-compete-directly-with-xbox-or-playstation.2296917/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eQVXcV8G8Dk:Ub81i1QhB4M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eQVXcV8G8Dk:Ub81i1QhB4M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/eQVXcV8G8Dk\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9ea5c3f3087bd56bd1c0a1b2e37bf5a7a57017bf35bb99d5d4157b0bed92d3a6","category":"Apple"}
