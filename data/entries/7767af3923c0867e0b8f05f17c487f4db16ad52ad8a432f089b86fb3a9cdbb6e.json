The service has also allowed Apple to limit footfall in its retail stores, with many customers doing their product browsing via the website instead.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShoppers can opt to pickup at their local Apple store and receive a notification when their products arrive, and this service has now been extended to China, albeit with one exception.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs noted by <em>9to5Mac</em>, anyone choosing in-store pickup in China will need to bring proof of ID to show that they personally made the order, whereas in other countries it's possible to designate someone else to collect the order for you.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information, customers in China can check out Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com.cn/shop/shipping-pickup\">delivery and pickup page</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/in-store-pickup-apple-mainland-china/\">Apple's Online Customers in Mainland China Can Now Select In-Store Pickup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-online-customers-in-mainland-china-can-now-select-in-store-pickup.2302784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4cHaNgkaF8c:IngfhHddn3s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4cHaNgkaF8c:IngfhHddn3s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4cHaNgkaF8c\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7767af3923c0867e0b8f05f17c487f4db16ad52ad8a432f089b86fb3a9cdbb6e","category":"Apple"}
