After three days of racing in the first WorldTour event of the year, only Adam Yates is within one minute of the defending Tour de France champ&#8217;s time on GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for the latest from the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dane Cash<br>News Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pogacar extends UAE Tour lead with stage 3 win</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadej Pogacar ascended to his first victory of 2021 on stage 3 of the UAE Tour, extending his GC lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 166 km stage from Al Ain Strata Manufacturing featured over 150 km of flat before finishing at Jebel Hafeet, where the stage was decided after Thomas De Gendt and then Tony Gallopin, who had spent most of the day off the front, were caught. A select group led up the finishing climb, with Pogacar&#8217;s UAE Team Emirates teammates and then Adam Yates&#8217;s Ineos Grenadiers teammates pushing the pace. Inside the last 5 km, Sepp Kuss put in a dig that only Yates and Pogacar followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trio distanced the rest of the field but then Kuss dropped back, leaving only Yates and Pogacar. Despite Yates&#8217;s best efforts, he could not drop Pogacar, who surged past in the last few hundred meters to nab the stage win. Yates settled for second on the same time with Sergio Higuita taking third 48 seconds later. Pogacar now leads the general classification by 43 seconds over Yates, with João Almeida in third, 1:03 back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"UAE Tour 2021 | Stage 3 Highlights\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjXpXYd5dMc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tour of Flanders team selections announced</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tour of Flanders organizers announced the team selections for both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s events on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the men&#8217;s side, B&amp;B Hotels-KTM, Bingoal WB, Sport Vlaanderen-Baloise, and Total Direct Energie have received wildcard bids to join the 19 WorldTour squads and automatic invitees Alpecin-Fenix and Arkéa-Samsic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All nine Women&#8217;s WorldTour teams will be in attendance for the women&#8217;s race, along with Aromitalia Basso Bikes Vaiano, A.R.
