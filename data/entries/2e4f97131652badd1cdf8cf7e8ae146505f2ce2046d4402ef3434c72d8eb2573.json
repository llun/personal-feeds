In the face of all that, Google is pulling out the Android smartphone playbook and tempting car manufacturers with a car-specific version of Android, called the \"Android Automotive OS.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let us build your operating system!\" Google essentially tells the car manufacturers. \"We've got great hardware and touch support, third-party apps, and a well-known developer SDK!
