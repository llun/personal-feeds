The whole thread is worth your attention. The gist of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>FWIW, my money is on this whole saga being, if you dig deeply\nenough, just briefings related to the 2016 Supermicro bad firmware\nupdate incident filtered through so many games of telephone that\nit’s eventually twisted itself into a story about tiny chips that\nnever happened. […]</p>\n\n<p>This story is too big, and the refutations too blunt and too\nnumerous to support on this level of third- and fourth-hand\nsourcing. If they have documents: go for it. Make fools of Apple,\nAmazon, FBI, NSA, DHS and ODNI by publishing them. Otherwise, this\nstory should not have run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bingo. And there’s still nothing — nothing — that indicates the original 2018 story should be entirely or at least largely retracted.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Matt Tait Disassembles Bloomberg’s ‘The Long Hack’ Point by Point’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/12/tait-disassembles-the-long-hack\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6e1697dbee6400346188301a88a9bcc328c9a739fc54c68346fc36a5613a0628","category":"Tech"}
