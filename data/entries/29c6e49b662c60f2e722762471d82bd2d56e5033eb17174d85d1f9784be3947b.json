This led to a situation where the\nmarket for art split in two, one fork for collectors and one for\nthose only interested in the work as an experience. I would argue\nthat this is good for everyone. Artists gained a way to sell work\nthat would otherwise be reduced to a commodity, collectors gained\naccess to a new and culturally vital art form, and great works of\nart became available to everyone at very close to the marginal\ncost of reproduction. […]</p>\n\n<p>When viewed in this light, the nature of NFTs becomes quite clear.\nAn NFT is a mechanism by which an artist can publicly attach their\ncryptographic <em>signature</em> to a digital work of art. In other\nwords, it is a technology that supports in the context of digital\narts the same kinds of signed editions that have existed in fine\nart photography for most of a century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To say this explanation made a lightbulb turn on in my head is an understatement. NFTs are the digital equivalent of a signed copy of a photograph. You can copy the art losslessly, but you can’t copy the signature, and that signature has value to some collectors.</p>\n\n<p>I’m still unconvinced that the NFTs — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122\">especially as currently implemented</a> — aren’t a scam, and I remain firmly convinced that this initial bubble <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/1370745752696324096\">is a Ponzi scheme of sorts</a>, but I at least have a feel for the basic idea why anyone <em>might</em> spend <em>some</em> money on one.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/26/rusher-nfts\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"29c6e49b662c60f2e722762471d82bd2d56e5033eb17174d85d1f9784be3947b","category":"Tech"}
