Apple Fellow <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a> has been handling the PR team since Dowling left, so Low's hiring will free up more of his time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a statement, Apple said that Low brings \"remarkable experience and leadership\" to Apple.<blockquote>Stella brings her remarkable experience and leadership to Apple's world-class communications teams.
