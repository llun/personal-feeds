(credit: Google)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Google is officially rolling out a new operating system, called Fuchsia, to consumers. The release is a bit hard to believe at this point, but Google confirmed the news <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/05/25/google-releases-fuchsia-os-nest-hub/\">to 9to5Google</a>, and several members of the Fuchsia team have confirmed it on Twitter. The official launch date was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismckillop/status/1397095595139997696\">apparently yesterday</a>. Fuchsia is certainly getting a quiet, anti-climactic release, as it's only being made available to one device, the Google Home Hub, aka the first-generation Nest Hub. There are no expected changes to the UI or functionality of the Home Hub, but Fuchsia is out there. Apparently, Google simply wants to prove out the OS in a consumer environment.</p>\n<p>Fuchsia's one launch device was originally called the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-home-hub-review-a-minimum-viable-product-with-potential/\">Google Home Hub</a> and is a 7-inch smart display that responds to Google Assistant commands. It came out in 2018. The device was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/google-combines-the-assistant-and-home-security-with-229-nest-hub-max/\">renamed</a> the \"Nest Hub\" in 2019, and it's only this first-generation device, not the second-generation Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max, that is getting Fuchsia. The Home Hub's OS has always been an odd duck. When the device was released, Google was pitching a smart display hardware ecosystem to partners based on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/android-things-hits-version-1-0-with-centralized-google-update-system/\">Android Things</a>, a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/google-kills-android-things-its-iot-os-in-january/\">now-defunct</a> Internet-of-things/kiosk OS. Instead of following the recommendations it gave to hardware partners, Google loaded the Home Hub with its in-house <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/google-home-hub-under-the-hood-its-nothing-like-other-google-smart-displays/\">Google Cast Platform instead</a>—and then undercut all its partners on price.</p>\n<p></p><aside><h2>Fuchsia and Flutter</h2>\n\t<ul><li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-launches-its-third-major-operating-system-fuchsia/\">Google launches its third major operating system, Fuchsia</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/googles-secretive-fuchsia-os-is-open-for-contributions/\">Google’s secretive Fuchsia OS is open for contributions</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/google-bridges-android-and-ios-development-with-flutter-1-0/\">Google bridges Android and iOS development with Flutter 1.0</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/googles-cross-platform-flutter-sdk-hits-release-preview-1/\">Google’s Flutter SDK moves out of beta with Release Preview 1</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/google-starts-a-push-for-cross-platform-app-development-with-flutter-sdk/\">Google starts a push for cross-platform app development with Flutter SDK</a></li>\n    </ul><span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/fuchsia-and-flutter/\">View more stories</a></span>\n</aside>\nFuchsia has long been a secretive project. We first saw the OS as a pre-alpha smartphone UI that was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/\">ported to Android</a> in 2017. In 2018, we got the OS <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/\">running natively</a> on a Pixelbook. After that, the Fuchsia team stopped doing its work in the open and stripped all UI work out of the public repository.<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767419#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767419&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ac1c51da6978af8a8922a295a355a625c6811c54051d3b7dac277e19ac4d60ac","category":"Tech"}
