A lot of people have wondered, if Google kills cookies, won't it just cook up some other method for individually tracking users?</p>\n<p>Today, Google answered those concerns in a post on its \"<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/\">Ads &amp; Commerce</a>\" blog, pledging it won't come up with \"any technology used for tracking individual people.\" The company wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We continue to get questions about whether Google will join others in the ad tech industry who plan to replace third-party cookies with alternative user-level identifiers. Today, we’re making explicit that once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You might look at that statement and think that Google is sacrificing something or turning over a new leaf when it comes to privacy, but really, the fact is Google doesn't need to track <em>individuals</em> for advertisements. Google's cookie-tracking replacement technology, the Chrome \"<a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox\">Privacy Sandbox</a>,\" uses group tracking, which is more in line with how advertisers think anyway.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746842#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746842&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e0b848d64cde88e225ed3632b2e8a6b04bcdcc7f16b6a05d9068c292b95c7ed","category":"Tech"}
