Google has apparently been thinking along the same lines, and in a <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html\">lengthy blog post Tuesday,</a> the company announced that the Android Open Source Project now supports Rust for low-level OS components.</p>\n<p>The Android team does a ton of work pushing Kotlin and Java for app developers, but those languages rely on the Android Runtime (ART) in order to function. You can't write anything lower-level than ART in Java, since there would be no runtime environment to run it on. In the past, Google has typically used C or C++, but neither of these are memory-managed languages, and that opens Android up to memory leaks and buffer overflows.</p>\n<p>Google lays out the benefits of Rust over C/C++, saying, \"Rust provides memory safety guarantees by using a combination of compile-time checks to enforce object lifetime/ownership and runtime checks to ensure that memory accesses are valid. This safety is achieved while providing equivalent performance to C and C++.\" In line with similar stats that <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/\">Microsoft has published</a>, Google's blog post says that \"memory safety bugs continue to be a top contributor of stability issues, and consistently represent ~70% of Android’s high severity security vulnerabilities.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755060#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755060&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"651630e13b20407d1096e4b68505e1cf6766e00785e684c2316749072af9ff61","category":"Tech"}
