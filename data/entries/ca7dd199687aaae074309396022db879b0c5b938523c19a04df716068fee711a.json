[credit:\n                        Mazda                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>On Wednesday, Mazda confirmed that it will bring its new battery-electric vehicle to the US later in 2021. It's called the MX-30, and it's an attractive compact crossover <a href=\"https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/mazda/mx-30-ev/\">that has been on sale in Europe for a few months already</a>. It's the first full EV to join the Mazda lineup. The MX-30 will be joined in time by a series hybrid version that uses a rotary engine as a range extender, as well as a new plug-in hybrid for an as-yet-unseen larger vehicle, plus a US-made hybrid crossover.</p>\n<p>The MX-30's technical specs probably won't win any bench races. There's a 107 kW (144 hp), 271 Nm (200 lb-ft) electric motor that drives the front axle, and a 35.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that has a 124-mile (200 km) range under the generous WLTP testing format. And DC fast charging tops out at a maximum of 50 kW, which equates to a 36-minute pitstop to get back to 80 percent state of charge on road trips.</p>\n<p>But we're expecting it to drive like a peach, as it shares the same Skyactiv Vehicle architecture as the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/12/the-2020-mazda-cx-30-is-a-crossover-youll-actually-enjoy-driving/\">CX-30 crossover</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/11/people-asked-for-a-mazda-3-with-more-power-the-2021-mazda-3-turbo-review/\">Mazda 3</a> sedan and hatchbacks, all of which are a joy from behind the wheel.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756570#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756570&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
