Apple Music currently streams at a bitrate of 256kbps, lower than Spotify Premium’s 320 kbps, but most listeners likely wouldn’t notice a difference. However, HiFi services up the quality by a factor of 4, with Tidal offering 1411kbps for lossless audio quality. Tidal describes its HiFi tier, which costs $20 a month, as “a more robust and crisp streaming format.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t offer lossless audio files through the iTunes Music Store. Back in 2009, it <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/194277/itunestore.html\">upped the encoding to a higher-quality 256 kbps AAC</a> (Advanced Audio Coding) and raised the prices from $0.99 to $1.29 but it hasn’t changed the bitrate since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/01/ios-14-6-beta-6-hifi-apple-music/&amp;xcust=1-1-345071-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macrumors contributor Steve Mosser</a> also spotted code references to “lossless audio,” “high-quality stereo streaming,” and “HiFi” with the Music app in the iOS 14.6 beta. The new higher-quality songs would presumably be available to all listeners but will be a huge selling point for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233522/airpods-pro-review.html\">AirPods Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> with spatial audio, as well as the HomePod mini. It’s also a clue that Apple might be bringing the high-end audio feature to the third-generation AirPods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a jam-packed <strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/331864/ios-14-5-features-airtags-siri-unlock-with-apple-watch-how-to-install.html\">iOS 14.5</a></strong> that landed last week, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344220/ios-%E2%80%A6\">iOS 14.6</a> doesn’t include any obvious front-facing features, so it could be a simple update targeted at the new AirPods. </p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"bd48338b1673229474b01cc700c349cfeacf2ca4a4e4ef983f5303e9e6d297a1","category":"Apple"}
