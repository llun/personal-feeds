There may be another in the works, however, as an unreleased \"World Timer\" watch face was spotted in a UIKit developer session.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/world-timer-watch-face.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were no details provided on this watch face, and it was accidentally pictured in a slide with multiple other <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> screenshots.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe analog watch face has a world map with a 24-hour clock that has the names of major cities around it, allowing users to determine the current time in different worldwide time zones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>This new “World Timer” watch face is shown at 8:48 in the “What’s New in UIKit” session! <a href=\"https://t.co/OkMBodEc6Z\">pic.twitter.com/OkMBodEc6Z</a></p>— Duraid Abdul (@duraidabdul) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duraidabdul/status/1402374131895574528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nDesign wise, the World Timer watch face is similar to some high-end watches that offer multiple time zone functionality, and it's also somewhat similar to the GMT watch face that lets you track two time zones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe World Timer watch face is not in watchOS 8 at the current time, so unless it was scrapped, it's something that Apple could be planning to add in a later beta update.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/world-timer-watch-face-wwdc/\">Unreleased 'World Timer' Watch Face Featured in WWDC Session</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unreleased-world-timer-watch-face-featured-in-wwdc-session.2299970/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6KNkZU14MKY:B5-fwfwJX7c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6KNkZU14MKY:B5-fwfwJX7c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6KNkZU14MKY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"42f1d2664db964457024fa8f6cb5bf666fb00b1a2c57592da6ef1344aef73f48","category":"Apple"}
