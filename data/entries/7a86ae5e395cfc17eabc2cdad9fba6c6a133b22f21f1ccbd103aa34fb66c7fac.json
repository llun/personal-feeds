{"title":"Our Long National HBO Max Apple TV Nightmare Is Over","link":"https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-fixes-apple-tv-playback-problems-issues-apology","date":1623360682000,"content":"\n<p>Screen Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the end of last week we detailed an update to the HBO Max Apple\nTV app that introduced a whole host of issues, making the app\nalmost unusable. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.screentimes.net/article/hbo-max-tvos-update-breaks-several-key-features-degrading-experience-significantly\">article</a> for the very long\nlist. The issues were so bad that HBO exec <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aforssell/status/1402013973986234368\">Andy Forssell even\naddressed them in a reply to John Siracusa on Twitter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, HBO has now issued a software update that reverts the\nplayback UI to the original tvOS version. I’ve verified this in\nthe 50.30.2 update and can confirm everything is back to normal\nfrom skipping ahead to asking Siri ‘What did they say?’ and\neverything in between.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You make a mistake, you fix it as fast as you can. Kudos, HBO Max tvOS team. </p>\n\n<p>Someone should send this to the new team behind the MLB app.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/10/hbo-max-apple-tv\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7a86ae5e395cfc17eabc2cdad9fba6c6a133b22f21f1ccbd103aa34fb66c7fac","category":"Tech"}
