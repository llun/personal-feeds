For those not practised in the brand's naming system, that means you get a choice of a titanium, carbon monocoque or aluminium bike and an aluminium electric bike equipped with a Mahle EBM X35+ motor.</p>\n<p>Within those four brackets, you can choose between Sport, Enthusiast and Pro models – along with Hero for the AL e – which includes a choice of Shimano GRX groupsets, with the Ti and SL also offering the option to go for the 13-speed Campagnolo Ekar.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/bikes/gravel-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Shop the full Ribble Gravel range

and flared bars to provide greater confidence and a more planted feel over varied technical terrain.</p>\n<p>'We have optimised the design of the new platform around integration, compatibility and attention to detail to give the rider a bike that will perform whatever their chosen style of off-road riding.'</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a

internal routing to keep out the muck and a wealth of mounting points for optimum adventure potential.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/bikes/gravel-bikes/\"
