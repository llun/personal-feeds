Launch a publicly-stated target and plan to reduce car dependency in the West Midlands</li>\n<li>Appoint an Active Travel Commissioner to lead the West Midlands cycling and walking revolution; providing them with the political support and funding to achieve real change.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9435/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no1-digital-editor-joes-ride-around-kent\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No1: Digital editor Joe's ride around Kent</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9469/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no2-editor-petes-ride-around-north-london-and-hertfordshire\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No2: Editor Pete's ride around North London and Hertfordshire</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9492/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no3-website-editor-jacks-spin-around-south-london-and-surrey\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No3: Website editor Jack's spin around South London and Surrey Hills</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9519/cyclist-doorstep-rides-no4-senior-editor-stus-new-forest-gravel-ride\">Cyclist Doorstep Rides, No4: Senior editor Stu's New Forest gravel ride</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTranter said of the agreement, 'Enabling a shift to walking and cycling for short journeys is no longer a \"nice to have\", it's essential to clean up the region's toxic air, tackle climate change and to build a more equitable and healthy transport system.</p>\n<p>'We need to reduce our car dependency and the time for change is now; the next elected Mayor of the West Midlands needs to not only have a bold vision but a desire to act immediately to realise the region's active travel potential.'</p>\n<p>For more information on the pledges and to read responses from all the involved candidates, visit <a href=\"https://adamtranter.com/active-travel-pledges/\" target=\"_blank\">adamtranter.com</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a373255a85f67e9f0c7155099adf70e5f367e465a48917b7b2f6c3eaac27a158","category":"Cycling"}
