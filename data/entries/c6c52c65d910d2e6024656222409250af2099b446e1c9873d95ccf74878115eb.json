Apple is likely to be the top vendor for a six-month period that ends March 31, 2021, with total shipments of over 150 million units, up 38% from the same period of a year earlier.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSamsung Electronics will rank second and see its shipments decline slightly in the six months, or roughly 60-65 million units each for fourth-quarter 2020 and first-quarter 2021. Xiaomi will be in third place with its shipments totaling 90 million units in the six months, representing an increase of over 80% from a year earlier. Huawei will ship less than 20 million smartphones to be in sixth place in the first quarter of 2021.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\nJP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/iphone-12-still-strong-despite-weaker-demand/\">claimed</a> that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> series quarterly shipments continue to enjoy a year-on-year 13% increase, despite a dip in demand, while Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said that the firm had \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/wedbush-iphone-13-1tb-storage-lidar/\">increased confidence</a>\" that Apple's 5G-driven product cycle would extend well into 2022.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThose projections appear to be generally reflected by <em>Digitimes</em>' analyses, which predict global shipments of 5G-enabled phones to reach over 600 million units in 2021 compared to 280 million units shipped a year earlier.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHuawei, Apple and Samsung were the top-three 5G phone vendors in 2020, accounting for over 70% of global 5G phone shipments, according to the Taiwanese industry publication.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12-Pro\">iPhone 12 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/iphone-12-pro-driving-q1-global-mobile-shipments/\">iPhone 12 Pro Models Expected to Drive 50% YoY Growth in Quarterly Global Smartphone Shipments</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-pro-models-expected-to-drive-50-yoy-growth-in-quarterly-global-smartphone-shipments.2286742/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FyLG0mshYSM:I0zwtqSaMdI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FyLG0mshYSM:I0zwtqSaMdI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FyLG0mshYSM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c6c52c65d910d2e6024656222409250af2099b446e1c9873d95ccf74878115eb","category":"Apple"}
