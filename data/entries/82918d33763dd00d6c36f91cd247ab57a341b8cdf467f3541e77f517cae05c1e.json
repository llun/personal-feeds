The popup is depicted below, but shown in Portuguese. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacMagazine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MacMagazine</a> o ‌iPhone‌ no 14.6 só desistiu de instalar o watchOS 7.5 no Apple Watch series 3 direto haha já fala direto pra desinstalar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/aloadt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#aloadt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/filipeesposito?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@filipeesposito</a> antes falava que não tinha espaço <a href=\"https://t.co/Urp0OHrzky\">pic.twitter.com/Urp0OHrzky</a></p>— Nicolas Lehmann (@NLehmann) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NLehmann/status/1398001140541820928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 27, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nIt's worth noting that prior to this update, Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211283\">did recommend</a> unpairing and re-pairing for Apple Watch Series 3 owners experiencing issues, but now it appears to be part of the installation process. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the age of the Apple Watch Series 3, the limited storage space, and the extra step to install new software, it's likely that Apple is planning to discontinue the Apple Watch Series 3, likely when new Apple Watch models are released later this year. Apple is at the current time still selling it as a low-cost option, but we do not recommend purchasing it over a Series 6 or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, both of which feature much newer technology.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/27/apple-watch-series-3-restore-when-updating/\">Apple Watch Series 3 Owners Now Required to Perform Restore When Updating Due to Storage Constraints</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-3-owners-now-required-to-perform-restore-when-updating-due-to-storage-constraints.2298165/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xvqE5UQwkmk:VFow3pXqnCw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xvqE5UQwkmk:VFow3pXqnCw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/xvqE5UQwkmk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"82918d33763dd00d6c36f91cd247ab57a341b8cdf467f3541e77f517cae05c1e","category":"Apple"}
