We started last year by publishing two of our games on PC, Horizon Zero Dawn and Predator, and both were profitable and really had a very successful publishing debut... In FY21 we will begin to publish some of our iconic PlayStation IP on mobile.</blockquote>PlayStation intends to publish an increasingly large number of titles on mobile, hoping that it will \"become steadily more important as time passes\" relative to console gaming.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSony <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/14/sony-smartphone-gaming-plans/\">previously claimed</a> that its move into mobile gaming would occur with at least five titles by March 2018, but it never came to fruition.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>VideoGamesChronicle</em>, PlayStation opened a new business unit to adapt its \"most popular franchises\" for mobile earlier this year and was hiring for developers to achieve a mobile product roadmap within a three to five-year time frame.<blockquote>PlayStation has a huge catalog of diverse first-party IP that can transition to smartphone gaming and complement our AAA games or live service games. We are exploring the mobile market with some wonderful PlayStation franchises so please stay tuned.</blockquote>Sony Interactive Entertainment owns a large number of popular video game franchises, including \"God of War,\" \"Gran Turismo,\" \"Killzone,\" \"The Last of Us,\" \"LittleBigPlanet,\" \"Ratchet &amp; Clank,\" \"Until Dawn,\" \"Uncharted,\" and more. The company's intention to move into mobile gaming will presumably see some of these titles arrive on iOS and iPadOS. Sony's PlayStation 5 DualSense controller also now works with iOS and iPadOS, which may aid the gaming experience with Sony's new mobile games.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSix years ago, rival company Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/08/nintendos-smartphone-game-this-year/\">announced</a> its foray into mobile gaming on iOS and other platforms. Although the company has seen some success in the business move, it has also experienced some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/25/nintendo-shut-down-miitomo/\">misfires</a>, and there have since been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/nintendo-retreating-mobile-gaming/\">indications</a> that Nintendo is \"retreating\" from its mobile gaming plans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe arrival of Sony's \"iconic IP\" on mobile platforms will occur by the end of the financial year in March 2022.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sony/\">Sony</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/playstation/\">PlayStation</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/27/playstation-video-games-coming-to-mobile/\">Sony Bringing PlayStation Video Game Franchises to Mobile by March 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sony-bringing-playstation-video-game-franchises-to-mobile-by-march-2022.2298080/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dcGk1X2DVqY:LuGDC3StgRM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dcGk1X2DVqY:LuGDC3StgRM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dcGk1X2DVqY\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"10d2dd1fb200d498da5794a637918c59773f8bb44b44c9e577c26ff0942fc2b9","category":"Apple"}
