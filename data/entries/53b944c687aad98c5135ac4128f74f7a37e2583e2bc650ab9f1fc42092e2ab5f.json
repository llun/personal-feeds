Those previous sales look downright cheap now, though, as bidding on another sealed <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <a href=\"https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-bros-wata-96-a-sealed-hangtab-1-code-mid-production-nes-nintendo-1985-usa/a/7242-93028.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515\">has already reached $372,000 on Heritage Auctions</a>.</p>\n<p>That price comes after 13 early proxy bids, placed ahead of four days of live bidding for a large lot of comics and games memorabilia set to start on April 1. The bid also includes a 20 percent \"buyer's premium\" that will go to Heritage Auctions itself and not the game's current owner.</p>\n<h2>Early provenance, excellent condition</h2>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/meet-the-man-who-got-100000-for-a-copy-of-super-mario-bros/\">some earlier high-priced <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> sales</a>, this copy isn't from the earliest production run of the game, which had a box sealed only with a small sticker and which was only sold in New York City during the NES' late 1985 test-market run. But this copy is one of the earliest <em>shrink-wrapped</em> editions of the game, sold only for a short time in late 1986, according to <a href=\"https://www.watagames.com/learn/blog/post/nes-black-box-variant-guide/\">WATA Games' guide</a>. This copy also received an incredible 9.6 out of 10 on WATA Games' quality scale, with an \"exceptional\" A+ seal in \"near-mint\" condition. It also still has an intact hangtab, meaning it never had its seal pierced for hanging it in a store display.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752439#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752439&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53b944c687aad98c5135ac4128f74f7a37e2583e2bc650ab9f1fc42092e2ab5f","category":"Tech"}
