Time to find out.\"</p>\n<p>I don't follow Formula 1. I don't follow NASCAR. But I do live in Austin, Texas, and I regularly ride a bike. So the concept of <a href=\"http://circuitoftheamericas.com/bike\">Bike Night at the Circuit of the Americas</a> (COTA)—an event series where this famed US racetrack invites local cyclists out on Tuesday nights to try two wheels where four usually roam—seemed cool enough. A June evening in Central Texas easily exceeds 90° F, even before you consider humidity or proximity to asphalt. But what harm could some casual riding on a fancy car circuit do? I could taste the postgame Kölsch before l took my bike off the rack.</p>\n<p>Then, of course, came Turn 1. <em>Whoa</em>. Quickly, I learned why COTA's starting stunner lives in <a href=\"https://cotaexperiences.com/blog/the-best-turns-at-circuit-of-the-americas\">racing infamy</a>. It doesn't look that bad when you're peering down from the Observation Deck, but on the ground, this 133-foot climb at the start of the 3.4-mile track really sets a tone for every lap. That tone: <em>COTA will kick your butt. </em></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775718#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775718&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fbff39cd63a7432a4f459043b923e394235e89af5a9813a79041c143286b0b65","category":"Tech"}
