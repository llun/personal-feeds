As a result, we have been <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac_Pro\">recommending for some time</a> that users not purchase the &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; as a high-end standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> currently offers a better value.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere have been a few rumors of an updated &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; over the years, including from analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> almost exactly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/\">one year ago</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's unclear whether the &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; is being discontinued entirely or if Apple is selling through existing stock in advance of an update, but the unusual note about dwindling supplies suggests that the machine may indeed be on the verge of complete discontinuation. If an updated version is coming, it appears it may not be ready to launch for some time yet and there may be a gap in availability once the current model sells out.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, Ben!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac-pro/\">iMac Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac_Pro\">iMac Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/06/imac-pro-while-supplies-last/\">iMac Pro No Longer Custom Configurable, Available &#039;While Supplies Last&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imac-pro-no-longer-custom-configurable-available-while-supplies-last.2287278/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EP9mZcostTI:Zmqgw_iz54w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EP9mZcostTI:Zmqgw_iz54w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/EP9mZcostTI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f83879906bb7bb47a041c0f393d5f5b1d1b77f68e10b49e25f9e110f92633a70","category":"Apple"}
