The team’s launch had no mention of reaching the WorldTour in two years or winning the Tour de France in five. Spectra instead aims to have a gender-balanced team with UCI licenses for road, cyclocross, and mountain bike by 2024. Better still, it will complement races across these three disciplines with gravel racing, Zwift racing, “place-to-place” records, and fastest-known-time attempts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has already taken the first steps towards achieving these ambitions, announcing a gender-balanced 12-rider team with UCI cyclocross registration for the forthcoming season, with backing from Wiggle and Vitus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We think that building a different path for the sport starts with teams taking the step to do things differently,” said team principal Bruce Dalton. “We want to inspire others to do the same and for riders to look beyond riding just one style of cycling”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rider line-up</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Beth Crumpton</li><li>Abbie Taylor</li><li>Hannah Larbiester</li><li>Hannah Payton</li><li>Xan Crees (U23)</li><li>Amira Mellor</li><li>Mikey Mottram</li><li>Ian Field</li><li>Ben Chilton (U23)</li><li>Dan Barnes (U23)</li><li>Bruce Dalton</li><li>Chris McGlinchey</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/spectra-wiggle-p-b-vitus-more-teams-like-this-please/\">Spectra Wiggle p/b Vitus – more teams like this, please</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"65145e0fc8aa61b6c8978faea6ecf2e1ced8a3d3db5d110750fe3802c1fb35d9","category":"Cycling"}
