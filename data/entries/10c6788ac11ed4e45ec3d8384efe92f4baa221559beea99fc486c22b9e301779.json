Bräunlein explained in an <a href=\"https://positive.security/blog/send-my\">extensive blog post</a> that it is possible to emulate the way in which an AirTag connects to the ‌Find My‌ network and broadcasts its location. The AirTag sends its location via an encrypted broadcast, so when this data is replaced with a message, it is concealed by the broadcast's encryption.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/find-my-network-message-exploit.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBräunlein's practical demonstration showed how short strings of text could be sent from a microcontroller running custom firmware over the ‌Find My‌ network. The text was received via a custom Mac app to decode and display the uploaded data.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not immediately clear if this ‌Find My‌ network exploit could be used maliciously or what useful purposes it may serve. Nonetheless, it seems that it could be difficult for Apple to prevent this unintended use due to the privacy-focused and end-to-end encrypted nature of the system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information, see Bräunlein's <a href=\"https://positive.security/blog/send-my\">full blog post</a>, which explains in detail the entire technical process behind passing arbitrary data through the ‌Find My‌ network.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/security/\">security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/12/find-my-network-exploited-to-send-messages/\">Find My Network Exploited to Send Messages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/find-my-network-exploited-to-send-messages.2295861/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-3Dns9FwSbk:xfsJKPI1324:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-3Dns9FwSbk:xfsJKPI1324:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-3Dns9FwSbk\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"10c6788ac11ed4e45ec3d8384efe92f4baa221559beea99fc486c22b9e301779","category":"Apple"}
