{"title":"PSA: Apple is Updating Old Apps With Latest Signing Certificate Ahead of iOS 14.5","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/psa-apple-updating-old-apps-latest-certificate/","date":1618584954000,"content":"Users may notice that a number of very old apps are receiving new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> updates. Instead of fixing bugs or adding new features, the updates are occurring because Apple is updating developers' apps that use a legacy â€ŒApp Storeâ€Œ code signing certificate with the latest version so that they can launch correctly in the upcoming releases of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/app-store-blue-banner.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopers of affected apps do not need to re-sign their apps themselves, since Apple will issue the update and new signing certificate itself. Apple is issuing the updates with the What's New text \"This app has been updated by Apple to use the latest Apple signing certificate.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple alerted developers of affected apps about the required update and its purpose, and the updates have now started rolling out to users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Ah yes, legacy, ye olden time of *checks notes* 2018 ðŸ˜‚<br /><br />To be fair, that does feel like a decade agoâ€¦ <a href=\"https://t.co/RCnk7hZVnB\">pic.twitter.com/RCnk7hZVnB</a></p>â€” Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1381771866080219139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe change only affects apps that have not been updated at all for several years, and therefore have an outdated code signing certificate. Apple conducted a similar wave of signing certificate updates in July last year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe updated signing certificates will allow apps to launch as expected in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everything-new-in-ios-14-5-beta/\">iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5</a>, which are due to be released very soon.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/psa-apple-updating-old-apps-latest-certificate/\">PSA: Apple is Updating Old Apps With Latest Signing Certificate Ahead of iOS 14.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-apple-is-updating-old-apps-with-latest-signing-certificate-ahead-of-ios-14-5.2291920/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=67CQus9BjDo:Dp7FBNWtZmo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=67CQus9BjDo:Dp7FBNWtZmo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/67CQus9BjDo\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a9dfa35909ac74f28de802946e9cac716703e67e59b7197dc6ce6db820abbb93","category":"Apple"}
