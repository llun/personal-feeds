But a wooden satellite looks like it might get to orbit later this year, via a project we can fully endorse. It's a bit of silly advertising by a plywood manufacturer that will ensure that a student project gets sent to space.</p>\n<p>The project, based in Finland, is called the <a href=\"https://www.wisaplywood.com/campaigns/wisawoodsat\">WISA WOODSAT</a>, and it has taken a bit of an indirect route to orbit. The design is based on cubesat format <a href=\"https://arcticastronautics.fi/what_is_kitsat\">called Kitsat</a>, which is intended for student projects. If the goal is simply to expose students to what it takes to make a compact satellite (the design is a 10 cm/side cube), the satellite can be built using cheap, easy-to-obtain hardware. But it can also be made using space-rated materials and sent to orbit.</p>\n<p>The WOODSAT started out as more of the former, with students around the country contributing different parts to a cubesat that was then taken aloft by a balloon. But now, with an opportunity to go to orbit, another version is getting an upgrade to survive the harsh environment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756436#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756436&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a4e275176cfdf09096ac4d140d04c9e43618701f38ee35ed5b22874e79a6129","category":"Tech"}
