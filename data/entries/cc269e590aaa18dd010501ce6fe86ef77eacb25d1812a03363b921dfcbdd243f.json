She has to team up with magical creatures to discover a force more powerful than luck itself. \"Spellbound\" is a musical fantasy that's set in a world of magic where a young girl aims to break the spell that has split her kingdom in two.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nUnder the partnership, two seasons of Skydance Animation series \"The Search for WondLa\" will be coming to &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj;. The show is based on the science fiction children's book by Tony DiTerlizzi, which follows the story of Eva Nine, a girl who spent most of her life living underground before being forced to flee outside and survive with a robot named Muthr, an alien named Rovander Kitt, and a water bear named Otto.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSkydance Animation is headed up by John Lasseter, the former chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar, but he left Disney in 2018 following allegations of sexual misconduct. Prior to joining Skydance Animation in 2019, Lasseter directed popular Disney movies that include Toy Story, Cars, and A Bug's Life, plus he executive produced many others.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/apple-inks-deal-with-skydance-animation/\">Apple Inks Multi-Year Deal With Skydance Animation for Kid-Friendly TV Shows and Movies</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-inks-multi-year-deal-with-skydance-animation-for-kid-friendly-tv-shows-and-movies.2285082/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1MZxyxSWuoI:fp97H60of0Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1MZxyxSWuoI:fp97H60of0Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1MZxyxSWuoI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cc269e590aaa18dd010501ce6fe86ef77eacb25d1812a03363b921dfcbdd243f","category":"Apple"}
