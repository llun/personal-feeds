Eight hundred kilometers (500 miles) away, in Denmark, an older man who had survived a lifetime of battles died sometime in his 50s. At first glance, there’s nothing to suggest a connection between them over such a distance. But according to a recent study of their DNA, the two men were second-degree relatives: half-siblings, uncle and nephew, or grandfather and grandson.</p>\n<p>Today, their skeletons lie side by side in the National Museum of Denmark, reunited after centuries, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.</p>\n<p>Geneticists sequenced the pair’s DNA as part of a much larger study, which sampled and sequenced ancient DNA <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/ancient-dna-sheds-light-on-viking-origins-travels/\">from more than 400 human skeletons</a> at sites across Europe and Greenland. That data revealed that Vikings were much more ethnically diverse than historians have often assumed, and it helped track the migrations that defined the Viking Age. Against the backdrop of those larger patterns, the ancient DNA from two skeletons, buried hundreds of kilometers apart under very different circumstances, told a much more personal story.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774420#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774420&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
