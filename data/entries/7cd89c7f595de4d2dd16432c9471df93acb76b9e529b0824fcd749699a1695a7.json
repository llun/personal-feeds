It's often <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/firmware-hacks-vulnerable-pc-components-peripherals/\">riddled with vulnerabilities</a>, it's difficult to update with patches, and it's increasingly the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-botnet-uefi-firmware/\">target of real-world attacks</a>. Now a well-intentioned mechanism to easily update the firmware of Dell computers is itself vulnerable as the result of four rudimentary bugs. And <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000188682\">these vulnerabilities</a> could be exploited to gain full access to target devices.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.eclypsium.com/2021/06/24/biosdisconnect/\">new findings</a> from researchers at the security firm Eclypsium affect 128 recent models of Dell computers, including desktops, laptops, and tablets. The researchers estimate that the vulnerabilities expose 30 million devices in total, and the exploits even work in models that incorporate <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-secured-core-pc/\">Microsoft's Secured-core PC protectionsâ€”a system specifically built</a> to reduce firmware vulnerability. Dell is releasing patches for the flaws today.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776495#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776495&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7cd89c7f595de4d2dd16432c9471df93acb76b9e529b0824fcd749699a1695a7","category":"Tech"}
