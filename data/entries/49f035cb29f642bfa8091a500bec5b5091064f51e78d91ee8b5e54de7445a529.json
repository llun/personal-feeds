This is the first time a branded Apple TV Plus button has appeared on any remote control.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll find it on the new Roku Voice Remote Pro, announced today, which features a rechargeable battery, headphone jack for private listening, and two programmable shortcut buttons. The usual branded buttons include Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, and now Apple TV Plus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s only room for four of these buttons on this remote. This is not a small deal.</p>\n\n<p>Amazingly, you can even tell which end is which by feel on this remote.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/apple-tv-plus-roku\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"49f035cb29f642bfa8091a500bec5b5091064f51e78d91ee8b5e54de7445a529","category":"Tech"}
