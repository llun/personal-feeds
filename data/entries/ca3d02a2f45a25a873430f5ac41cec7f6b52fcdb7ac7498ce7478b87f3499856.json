But as Dr. Nirav\nShah, Maine’s CDC director, said at that first meeting, making no\ndecision was a decision. While the U.S. has plentiful supplies of\nthe Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, the J&amp;J vaccine — which\nonly requires one shot — has been very valuable in vaccinating\npeople who might have a hard time returning to the same location\nthree or four weeks later to get a shot, including homeless\npeople, people who live in remote locations, and transient\nworkers, as well as college students who may soon be going home\nfrom school. So you can’t just substitute Pfizer and Moderna shots\nfor all J&amp;J shots. What this means is that the decision to keep\nthe vaccine pause in place amounted to a decision not to vaccinate\nlots of people who otherwise would have gotten vaccinated. Some of\nthose people who did not get vaccinated have been or will be\ninfected with Covid, and some of them will be hospitalized, and\nsome will die. That was a concrete and undeniable consequence of\nthe decision to extend the pause.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ballpark numbers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At Friday’s meeting, the CDC’s Sara Oliver said that over the next\n6 months, the J&amp;J vaccine would be expected to result in 800–3500\nfewer ICU admissions, and 600–1400 fewer deaths, while causing\n26–45 cases of clotting. If you extrapolate from those numbers,\nthey suggest that if the pause had ended 10 days earlier,\nsomewhere between 33 and 75 lives would have been saved, at the\ncost of 1–2 cases of clotting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And those cases of clotting likely would not have been fatal.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/26/surowiecki-jnj-vaccine\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ca3d02a2f45a25a873430f5ac41cec7f6b52fcdb7ac7498ce7478b87f3499856","category":"Tech"}
