However, despite mass production for the laptops starting later in the year and next year, <em>DigiTimes</em> still reports that Apple will announce them in the second half of 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple plans to release two miniLED-backlit MacBook Pro products - a 14-inch and a 16-inch - in the second half of 2021, noted the sources.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJudging from the supply of miniLED backlighting applications, volume production of the 14-inch MacBook Pro is likely to begin in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the 16-inch model will start in the first quarter of 2022, said the sources.</blockquote>The scenario described by <em>DigiTimes</em> is reminiscent of the launch of the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>. The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> was announced in April but didn't begin shipping until the second half of May. Even then supply continues to remains tight, with some customers having to wait until July.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman has previously noted that Apple could be planning to announce the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/macbook-pro-64gb-ram-summer-2021/\">as soon as early this summer</a>.
