{"title":"New iMac Tidbits: Headphone Jack on Side, Ethernet Port on Power Adapter, Spatial Audio and WiFi 6 Support, No SD Card Slot","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/imac-tidbits-headphone-jack-wifi-6-ethernet/","date":1619012323000,"content":"Apple yesterday announced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-redesigned-imac/\">completely redesigned 24-inch iMac</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon chip. The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, the first major redesign of the Mac desktop computer since 2012, has several changes compared to the previous generation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/m1-imac-orange.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the aftermath of the event, a few new features and tidbits may have slipped under the radar, so we’ve compiled this list of some of the less-talked-about features and changes of the new 24-inch ‌iMac‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>First Mac with Built-In Spatial Audio</h3>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/imac-spatial-audio.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 24-inch ‌iMac‌ is the first Mac to feature built-in Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos. This is enabled by six brand new high-fidelity speakers that work in junction with force-canceling woofers. Apple says in tandem, the new speakers and woofers create \"the best speakers in any Mac.\" Spatial Audio is available on compatible <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices with Dolby Atmos content, and now it's coming to the Mac for the first time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>First iMac with WiFi 6</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌M1‌ Apple silicon <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> released in November <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/10/m1-macs-wifi-6-support/\">were the first Macs</a> to support the new and faster WiFi 6 protocol. With ‌M1‌ now on the ‌iMac‌, the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ becomes the first Mac desktop computer to support WiFi 6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Headphone Jack on The Side</h3>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iMac-power-speaker-heaphones-copy.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new 24-inch ‌iMac‌ features a radically thinner design compared to the previous generation. While visually pleasing, this new design did present a challenge for where to place the 3.5mm headphone jack. Typically, the headphone jack would be placed on the back of the ‌iMac‌, but with the new 24-inch model, the jack is placed on the left side. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Ethernet Port on Power Adapter</h3>\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/imac-ethernet-port.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother problem the new thin design of the ‌iMac‌ presented was where to place the Ethernet port. Apple's solution to the dilemma is to place the Ethernet port directly into the power adapter. Apple says this new \"cool new innovation\" means users can keep their desks less cluttered, while still enjoying the benefits of Ethernet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>No SD Card Slot</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nPrevious generation ‌iMac‌ models featured an SD card slot reader on the rear. The new design of the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ made this a challenge. In theory, Apple could have easily placed the SD card reader on the side, like the headphone jack, but instead, it instead decided to remove it entirely.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, these are just a few of the many new features coming with the 24-inch ‌iMac‌.
