The flaw, which Ivanti <a href=\"https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44784/\">disclosed last week</a>, carries a severity rating of 10 out of a possible 10. The authentication bypass vulnerability allows untrusted users to remotely execute malicious code on Pulse Secure hardware, and from there, to gain control of other parts of the network where it's installed.</p>\n<h2>Federal agencies, critical infrastructure, and more</h2>\n<p>Security firm FireEye <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/04/suspected-apt-actors-leverage-bypass-techniques-pulse-secure-zero-day.html\">said in a report</a> published on the same day as the Ivanti disclosure that hackers linked to China spent months exploiting the critical vulnerability to spy on US defense contractors and financial institutions around the world. Ivanti confirmed in a <a href=\"https://blog.pulsesecure.net/pulse-connect-secure-security-update/\">separate post</a> that the zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22893, was under active exploit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761727#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761727&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9949248818af32b104bfc9e41f806f1171f3f692358c0f8e0a14145e571b5250","category":"Tech"}
