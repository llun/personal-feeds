The British carmaker is best-known for lightweight sports cars, but it's probably nearly as well-known for being perennially broke. At least it was. In 2017, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/05/lotus-cars-is-saved-being-bought-by-chinas-geely/\">Geely bought the brand and its Malaysian parent company Proton</a> with the promise of reinvestment. And Geely has a track record in that regard—in 2010, it bought Volvo from Ford, then bankrolled it and stood back to watch as the Swedish OEM revitalized itself.</p>\n<p>Well, wonder no more because on Tuesday morning, Lotus revealed its master plan. It's preparing for <em>four</em> separate vehicle architectures, which it says will be exclusive to Lotus within the Geely group (which includes Polestar as well as Volvo) but available to other OEMs through the well-respected Lotus Engineering consultancy.</p>\n<p>The first vehicle architecture, and probably least important, is called Extreme. We've actually already seen the first car that will use this hypercar platform: the Evija, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-first-all-new-lotus-in-years-will-be-a-1971hp-electric-car/\">a four-motor electric vehicle with 1,971 hp (1,470 kW) and a $2.1 million price tag to go with it</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760341#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760341&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
