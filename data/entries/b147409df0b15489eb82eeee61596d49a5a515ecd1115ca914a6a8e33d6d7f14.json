On the outside, the electric hatchback has a bold, new face. On the inside, there are new displays and new front seats. Chevy has even cut the price by more than $5,000, which means the 2022 Bolt EV starts at $31,995 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/gm-sold-200000-electric-vehicles-by-q4-2018-reuters-source-says/\">even though GM has sold too many EVs to qualify for the IRS 30D tax credit</a>.</p>\n<p>The automaker also debuted a second Bolt derivative, called the Bolt EUV. In effect, this is a stretched Boltâ€”it's almost 3 inches (75mm) longer in the wheelbase, and more than 6 inches (161mm) longer overall. However, the $33,995 Bolt EUV is also ever so slightly wider and taller, growing 0.2 inches (5mm) in both dimensions. Consequently, the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV share no body panels, even though they're recognizable as a family.</p>\n<p>The Super Cruise hands-free highway driving assist will be an available option for the Bolt EUV, which is the first time it has appeared in a General Motors product wearing a Chevy badge. Super Cruise won't be available as an option on the Bolt EV, however.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742250#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742250&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
