Ahead of the software's debut, <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-first-look-screenshots/\">XDA Developers</a> has shared some leaked screenshots that give us an idea of what we can expect from the new software.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/google-privacy-dot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1173\" height=\"1200\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782596\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-first-look-screenshots/\">XDA Developers</a>, the screenshots are sourced from an \"early draft of a document made to summarize changes in Android 12,\" and those who are using <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> will notice a few similarities between Apple's latest update and Google's upcoming release, as <em><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3606850/this-android-12-leak-looks-an-awful-lot-like-ios-14.html#tk.rss_all\">PCWorld</a></em> points out.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple in &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; added a little dot in the status bar to let you know if the microphone or the camera is activated, and in Android 12, Google appears to have a similar option. When the camera or the microphone is in use, there's a green bar at the top of the Android interface.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAfter an app has accessed the camera or the microphone, Android 12 displays a small dot that can be tapped to let you see the specifics of which app used the phone hardware.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/google-privacy-dot-info.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"554\" height=\"361\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782597\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle is also adding toggles for universally disabling the camera and the microphone in its overhauled privacy interface, which goes a bit beyond what Apple offers. With iPhones and iPads, you can disable camera and microphone access on an app-by-app basis, but not for every app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a> interface in Android 12 is similar to the &zwnj;widgets&zwnj; interface in &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; with a cleaner look and better organization to make it easier to find &zwnj;widgets&zwnj; to use on the Home screen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/google-widgets.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"957\" height=\"1023\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782598\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple likely won't be upset that Google is following in its footsteps to boost privacy controls, as Apple execs have said several times that when it comes to privacy protections, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/craig-federighi-apple-privacy-keynote/\">is happy to see</a> competitors copying its work.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle is also planning to embrace another Apple privacy change - App Tracking Transparency. Recent reports suggest that Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/google-app-tracking-transparency-plans/\">is considering</a> a \"less stringent\" version of the feature, which requires app developers to get user permission before tracking them across apps and websites. \"We're always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app ecosystem,\" said a Google spokesperson.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe leaked screenshots from XDA Developers haven't been confirmed, but we should see the new Android 12 operating system features later in February.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/android-12-screenshots-ios-14-privacy-features/\">Leaked Screenshots Reveal iOS 14-Like Privacy Features Coming in Android 12</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaked-screenshots-reveal-ios-14-like-privacy-features-coming-in-android-12.2284009/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4l1IJWutGgQ:H95jgdXIWEo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4l1IJWutGgQ:H95jgdXIWEo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4l1IJWutGgQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d73766b95d004dc0c00542a989cc26f9b12ba532cfecc8d497f83a2de6e30565","category":"Apple"}
