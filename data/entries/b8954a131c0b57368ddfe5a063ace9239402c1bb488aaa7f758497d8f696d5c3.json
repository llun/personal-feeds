Maxxis designed the Receptor for rides on predominantly smooth surfaces with the occasional unpaved adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maxxis says the Receptor is a &#8220;semi-slick gravel tire designed for riding on pavement, hard-packed dirt roads, and light gravel&#8221;. Available in two sizes – 650x47b and 700x40c – the Receptor will be available in all black or with tan sidewalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tubeless-ready tyres feature a 120 tpi casing and dual compound design which is said to balance rolling resistance and traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-481136\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Receptor-Gravel-Tyre.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Maxxis has brought its EXO Protection technology across from its mountain bike tyres to this new gravel offering. EXO is a woven fabric said to be lightweight and flexible, adding extra sidewall protection without impacting tyre performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the addition of the Receptor, Maxxis now has five tyres in its gravel category. The Receptor sits between the high-volume Velocita slick and the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/02/maxxis-tubeless-gravel-tyres-review-ravager-versus-rambler-and-re-fuse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">knobbier Rambler</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing is TBC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For information, head to <a href=\"https://www.maxxis.com/tires/bicycle/gravelcross?typeId=136&amp;styleId=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maxxis.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/maxxis-receptor-is-a-new-gravel-tyre-featuring-mtb-tech-and-a-tan-sidewall/\">Maxxis Receptor is a new gravel tyre featuring MTB tech and a tan sidewall</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b8954a131c0b57368ddfe5a063ace9239402c1bb488aaa7f758497d8f696d5c3","category":"Cycling"}
