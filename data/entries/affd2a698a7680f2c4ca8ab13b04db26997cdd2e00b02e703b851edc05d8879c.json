Tony Martin (Jumbo-Visma) hit the sign and then the ground, and most of the peloton followed. The second crash happened at high speed with less than 10 km to go and was even more significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the dust has settled on stage 1 of the Tour, here are the riders that were injured on the day. According to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuroHoody/status/1408868495262093315\" target=\"_blank\">Tour’s official medical report</a>, a total of 21 riders received notable injuries:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Riders injured in the first big crash:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Mads Pedersen (Trek Segafredo)</strong></li><li><strong>Dries Devenyns</strong> <strong>(Deceuninck-QuickStep)</strong></li><li><strong>Xandro Meurisse</strong> <strong>(Alpecin-Fenix)</strong></li><li><strong>Jan Bakelants</strong> <strong>(Intermarché-Wanty Gobert)</strong></li><li><strong>Aurélien Paret Peintre</strong> <strong>(AG2R Citroën)</strong></li><li><strong>Søren Kragh Andersen</strong> <strong>(DSM)</strong></li><li><strong>Kristian Sbaragli (Alpecin-Fenix)</strong></li><li><strong>Casper Pedersen (DSM)</strong></li><li><strong>Jasha Sütterlin</strong> <strong>(DSM)</strong>: Large hematoma to his wrist. <span>Won’t start stage 2.</span></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>A big crash in the bunch forces <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JashaStterlin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JashaStterlin</a> to abandon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeTour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LeTour</a>.
