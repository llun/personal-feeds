The drag race between Lorena Wiebes and Emma Norsgaard on stage five could end up repeating itself today as Norsgaard searches for a win over Wiebes. The two have each taken their first ever Giro stage wins at this race, and if the breakaway doesn't have it, one of these two no doubt will.</p>\n<p><strong><em><a
