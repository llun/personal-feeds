(credit: Cricut)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Crafting device-maker Cricut has completely abandoned a plan to start requiring all device owners to pay a monthly subscription fee following a week of sustained public blowback.</p>\n<p>Cricut makes cutting machines for precise detail work used by millions of home crafters. The machines work much like printers, but in the inverse: you put a pattern into the software, send it to the device, and the machine slices your design into paper, vinyl, fabric, or a hundred other materials. Users who owned the machines have always been able to import as many of their own designs into the software, Design Maker, as they wish. </p>\n<p>Last week, however, Cricut announced it was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/cricut-retroactively-adds-subscription-fee-to-millions-of-devices/\">imposing a $7.99 monthly subscription</a>Â fee for anyone who wished to upload more than a handful of patterns into Design Maker in a given calendar month. The subscription would apply not only to new users, but also to the millions of consumers who already laid out hundreds of dollars for a Cricut device and all its attendant accessories.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750899#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750899&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kate Cox","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68dd6e95c4c5f66243e35aad9d41306264cfe2792e88b921662ba43007fbe4f4","category":"Tech"}
