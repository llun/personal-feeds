Perhaps you&#8217;ve owned a pair or maybe you&#8217;ve seen them in a shop, or on this very website back in the day. When the Eddy Merckx editions came out, traditional pedals and toe clips were the ideal foot retention system. We&#8217;ve come a long way with clipless designs since, which is why the new Velosamba cycling shoes utilize an SPD design, perfect for commuting. Adidas took this pedigree and meshed it with the classic Samba silhouette in an online-exclusive model, in four UK colors (the US market gets one color &#8211; black). </p>\n<p>The Velosamba retails for $120.
