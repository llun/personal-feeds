Both flights ended in fire at the landing site. SpaceX founder and chief engineer Elon Musk has estimated about a 60 percent chance of success this time—which suggests the probability is a little bit higher than that, given his penchant for setting expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to the previous two flights, which took place <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/starship-rises-high-performs-a-flawless-flip-but-doesnt-quite-stick-the-landing/\">in December</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/as-starships-crash-understand-this-is-a-stupidly-difficult-thing-to-do/\">early February</a>, SpaceX will launch its Starship vehicle to an altitude of about 10 km under the power of three Raptor engines. There, it will switch from its main propellant tanks to smaller ones near the top of the vehicle and perform a \"belly flop\" maneuver, reorienting itself to simulate returning from orbit. This allows Starship to both bleed off velocity as well as ensure its reusability without a massive heat shield.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746342#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746342&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4ec71c3ba00222b2a65543967b6dc8bdc817dd3ab93e6ea88b1c246923883cd","category":"Tech"}
