That&#8217;s a good sign, right? People are very interested in this bike and it&#8217;s easy to see why. Dillen from Baphomet originally called this bike his &#8220;Right-Hand Path&#8221;, with his personal hardtail being the &#8220;Left-Hand Path,&#8221; yet his Instagram followers summed it up perfectly with the catchy name &#8220;Shreddy Rando.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s look at this bike in detail, including a synopsis from Dillen.<span id=\"more-207214\"></span></p>\n<p>When I do Beautiful Bicycle galleries from framebuilders, I usually email them, clarifying my notes, and asking questions I might have forgotten during the Shop Visit. Dillen&#8217;s response made me change this up a bit, so let&#8217;s just read what he has to say:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206998\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-78.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>I specifically designed it thinking about the old forest service broncos.
