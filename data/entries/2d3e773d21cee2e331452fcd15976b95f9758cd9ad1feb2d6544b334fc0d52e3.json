Cut through by the Continental Divide, it’s home to many of the highest peaks in North America, along with semi-arid valleys and verdant forests.</p>\n<p>Subject to extreme weather as varied as the terrain, it’s a playground for cyclists with the prerequisite respect for the conditions.</p>\n<p>Located in the state capital of Denver, in the South Platte River Valley, it also provides Pactimo with both inspiration and testing ground for its range of innovative cycle clothing.</p>\n<p>From the canyon roads of Red Rocks to the extreme altitude of Pikes Peak or the endless miles of little-travelled gravel backroads, having roots in this landscape equips Pactimo products with the ability to perform anywhere in the world.</p>\n<h3>Endless summer</h3>\n<p>Translated to the marginally less rugged landscape of the UK, it means riders here can be sure Pactimo’s clothing is ready to take on whatever task they set themselves to. Now, as the weather hits its peak on both sides of the Atlantic, many of us will be looking to push our mileage while spending extended hours on the bike.</p>\n<p>The perfect foundation for the most demanding summer rides, Pactimo’s Summit Stratos bib shorts are designed for extreme adventures, all-day rides, and self-supported escapades both on and off-road.</p>\n<p>Born from Pactimo’s experience racing events in Colorado, where circuit times can easily exceed 12 hours, every effort has been made to make these shorts as supportive as possible.</p>\n<p>Based around a second-generation Elastic Interface Endurance Super Air chamois, this was designed for Pactimo specifically to provide all-day comfort. With a body constructed using Swiss-milled, ceramic-print fabric, this is both incredibly lightweight and extremely durable.</p>\n<p>Made to ease the experience of spending multiple hours in the saddle, its evenly distributed compression reinforces hardworking muscles while providing heat dissipation to regulate your temperature throughout long, sunny days.</p>\n<p>Built to be as unobtrusive as possible, the Summit Stratos’ uppers are designed to extend their supportive nature while providing absolutely no possible points of irritation. Crucial on hot and arduous rides, a combination of lightweight and breathable mesh around the waist plus a raw cut double-knit fabric for the shoulders and front straps aims to effectively make the uppers disappear.</p>\n<p>For forward-thinking road cyclists or dedicated gravel aficionados, the Summit Stratos shorts are also available with low-profile thigh pockets. Offering readily accessible extra storage, they make mid-ride refuelling easier and safer by providing supplementary space alongside your jersey pockets.</p>\n<p>Twinned with additional stretchy mesh pockets on the reverse of the uppers, they’ll also be popular with those who prefer to ride in more casual tops.</p>\n<h3>Out all day</h3>\n<p>You don’t need to have found yourself pushing into a headwind across the Great Plains to understand that aerodynamics has a significant effect on all kinds of riders. Whether racing on road, pushing distances on paved surfaces, or taking part in one of the growing number of gravel events either here or in the States, evading the wind is one way to go faster.</p>\n<p>Expanded over the course of longer rides, these benefits only increase. Pactimo’s Summit Aero jersey has therefore been designed for those who want the very best in fabrics and design in a next-to-skin aerodynamic fitting jersey. Created from four-way stretch material, it’s lightweight and breathable, making it an excellent choice for racing conditions and all-day adventures alike.</p>\n<p>Suited to the height of summer, as part of Pactimo’s ongoing effort to reduce its carbon footprint, the Italian-made Borghini fabric used to construct the jersey is 100% recycled. Complemented by strategically-placed hexagonal mesh for breathability and weight reduction, these materials are paired to a semi-auto-locking zipper which allows for one-handed operation when you want to vent or close the jersey.</p>\n<p>Matched by a low-profile collar for aerodynamic comfort, the jersey’s sleeves are raw-edged to provide comfort along with a seamless and efficient transition between it and the wearer. At the rear, wider, deeper pockets with expanding bottom bellows are backed by a separate zippered compartment for your valuables.</p>\n<p>Available in Classic and Axis versions, the first of these arrive rendered in block shades of black, blue, red, or off-white. In contrast, the Axis colourways bring together more vibrant tones with graphic striations that divide the body of the jersey.</p>\n<h3>Straight from Pactimo</h3>\n<p>Tested and designed amongst some of the world’s most beautiful, varied, and challenging terrain, Pactimo is equally demanding in its approach to production and sales. Unlike most of its competitors, Pactimo owns its factory in Guangzhou, meaning everyone who works there is an employee of Pactimo. This concentration of expertise and oversight allows for the highest welfare and quality standards.</p>\n<p>This leaves Pactimo confident enough to offer a full warranty if a product does not live up to its expected lifetime or the performance demanded by its owner. It will also replace or repair any item to restore the original function without charge for the lifetime of the garment.</p>\n<p>At the same time, despite the guaranteed performance and high-quality features of the clothing, Pactimo’s direct to consumer model ensures its prices are kept extremely competitive.</p>\n<p>This model also allows Pactimo to take responsibility for customer service – while it’s not quite as good as making it to Colorado yourself, it’s still a great benefit to have.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Riders in the UK can shop the entire range <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5718346065&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
