'It’s good to have an extra day of racing before I leave for Italy, but I’ll also start with confidence and expect a nice race.</p>\n<p>'Obviously, I would have liked to finish the UAE Tour, especially because we had a nice lead in the GC with our group after the opening stage, and a good final classification could have been in the making. But I’m also happy that we got home fairly quickly and without any problems, and that our spring campaign hasn’t been jeopardised.</p>\n<p>'We can be ambitious for Kuurne. I think I can be of added value to Tim [Merlier], who for me is one of the fastest guys in the peloton, and at the same time we can bet on two horses.' </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"dab01922de1c737f1bf6bea82d7865c4cfdeb555bb701c6dedefdbc92372dad2","category":"Cycling"}
