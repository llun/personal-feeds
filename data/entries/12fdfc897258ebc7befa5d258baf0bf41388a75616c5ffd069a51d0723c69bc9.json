This location was the city's retail hub for the first half of the twentieth century, and is now home to a dozen theater locations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the beginning, Apple has envisioned the Tower Theatre store as one of the world's most prominent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a> locations, and Apple has been overhauling the interior of the building to turn it into retail space and an active community area. Apple shared a rendering of what Tower Theatre might look like back in 2018.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/08/appletowertheatrerenovation.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe redesign preserves the ornate Renaissance Revival style of the interior of the theater, which was originally built to mimic the Paris Opera House with French, Spanish, Moorish, and Italian elements.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with all retail locations, Tower Theatre will host free Today at Apple Sessions, and the location features a Forum and a Video Wall to facilitate interaction, according to <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/11/apple-store-tower-theatre-los-angeles-opening-soon/\">9to5Mac</a></em>'s Michael Steeber.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to Apple's restoration of the location, Tower Theatre was in disrepair, which is why it took Apple so long to refurbish it. Apple used original Tower Theatre blueprints and photographs to restore original theater elements like murals, decorations, and the leaded-glass window over the entrance.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has taken on other major restoration projects and those locations have become major flagships with some of the most memorable and iconic store designs. These include Covent Garden, the Opéra store in Paris, Apple Kurfürstendamm in Berlin, Apple Amsterdam built in the famous Hirsch building, Apple's Grand Central store in New York, and the Carnegie Library store in Washington, D.C.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-basics-help-and-buying-advice.78\">Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/apple-tower-theatre-june-24/\">Apple's Flagship Tower Theatre Store Opening in Los Angeles on June 24</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-flagship-tower-theatre-store-opening-in-los-angeles-on-june-24.2300464/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2kxIthDbtx8:7iRgYS_qqyY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2kxIthDbtx8:7iRgYS_qqyY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2kxIthDbtx8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"12fdfc897258ebc7befa5d258baf0bf41388a75616c5ffd069a51d0723c69bc9","category":"Apple"}
