{"title":"Apple TV+ Original Content Quality","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/13/apple-tv-plus-highest-quality-streaming-service/","date":1618851206000,"content":"\n<p>José Adorno, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new study reveals that Apple TV+ has the highest-quality content\nwhen compared to Netflix, HBO Max, Prime Video, Disney+, and Hulu.\nThe <a href=\"https://www.self.inc/info/which-tv-streaming-service-best-value-for-money/\">analysis from Self Financial uses IMDb scores with US\ncustomer data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The study found that although Apple TV+ had the highest average\nIMDb score for its titles (7.24), it has fewer than 70 titles to\nchoose from. In terms of their libraries of content, Apple TV+ has the highest\npercentage of “good” and “excellent” at almost 86%. But, again, it\nhas the smallest offering at just 65 titles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This fits with my theory (which I <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2020/10/09/ep-298\">stole from M.G. Siegler</a>) that Apple TV+ is the new HBO: the streaming service with an emphasis on <em>quality</em> not <em>quantity</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which — I very much liked season 1 of <em><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/for-all-mankind/umc.cmc.6wsi780sz5tdbqcf11k76mkp7\">For All Mankind</a></em>, but season 2 is even better. Last week’s episode — my god, that ending. Just a terrific show.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/apple-tv-plus-quality\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"78d12c70be16690386e99a1678e889d7bce64ceb8bbc79aacb86a7e1f6e78af5","category":"Tech"}
