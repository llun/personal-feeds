{"title":"Sagan won’t join Deceuninck-Quickstep","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/sagan-wont-join-deceuninck-quickstep/","date":1622285401000,"content":"<p>Patrick Lefevere revealed in his weekly <a href=\"https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20210528_97146930\" target=\"_blank\">Het Nieuwsblad column</a> that he won’t sign Peter Sagan. The Belgian team did however reach a new six-year deal with Specialized. Sagan comes with an entourage of riders and staff and Lefevere indicates he doesn’t want a team within the team. “I can’t unite that with our Wolfpack philosophy.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not that Lefevere doesn’t believe in Sagan anymore, despite his being deemed by his current Bora-hansgrohe team manager Ralph Denk as ‘past his prime’ and ‘earning too much money’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have shown time and time again that we can get older riders back on track. I am convinced we would be able to do the same with Sagan,” Lefevere stated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The link between Sagan and Deceuninck-Quickstep comes through Specialized, the American bike brand paying a substantial part of Sagan’s salary. Deceuninck-Quickstep has been riding Specialized for many years and have renewed the contract until 2027. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Zdenek Bakala [main sponsor] and Mike Sinyard [CEO Specialized] went on a bike ride together and Zdenek liked the idea of signing Sagan. It all fit well but I stepped on the brakes. Sagan comes with his brother, Erik Baska, Daniel Oss and Maciej Bodnar, two mechanics, two soigneurs, a PR manager, a hospitality manager and a sports director. I don’t want a team within my team.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sagan’s manager Giovanni Lombardi indicated that that team of eleven could be altered but he just recently told me there was a team who would take the whole package. I read that’s Total-Direct Energie. I like Sagan for his loyalty in wanting to find places for the people around him but our cooperation will be for a next life.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lefevere is working on his team for 2022 because many of the riders have contracts that end this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am not in a rush to sign new riders. I first talk with the current riders like Florian Senéchal, Mattia Cattaneo and Fabio Jakobsen and I have some talks scheduled in the Giro. Judging by my inbox our team is still very popular. Even riders who left are now in contact to return but I won’t name names. I take my time. At the end of the transfer season there are bargains and I like to have some budget left.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/sagan-wont-join-deceuninck-quickstep/\">Sagan won’t join Deceuninck-Quickstep</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"José Been","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"be7ad594d0c3fa691cff37e1ccf337adffd776e828e849ef79f2b8aa1f82f123","category":"Cycling"}
