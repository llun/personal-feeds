Less than 33% of iOS users opt in to tracking, according to ad-measurement firm Branch Metrics Inc.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the prices for mobile ads directed at iOS users have fallen, while ad prices have risen for advertisers seeking to target Android users. […]</p>\n\n<p>Digital-ad agency Tinuiti Inc. has seen a similar pattern in its clients’ spending, research director Andy Taylor said. When iOS users opted out of tracking, Tinuiti advertisers couldn’t bid on them, he said. That dearth of iOS users drove up demand—and ad prices—for Android users. About 72.8% of smartphones world-wide use the Android operating system, and about 26.4% use iOS, according to Statcounter.</p>\n\n<p>Tinuiti’s Facebook clients went from year-over-year spend growth of 46% for Android users in May to 64% in June. The clients’ iOS spending saw a corresponding slowdown, from 42% growth in May to 25% in June. Android ad prices are now about 30% higher than ad prices for iOS users, Mr. Taylor said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If any part of this is surprising, it’s the claim that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/f/status/1412083407857852416\">as many</a> as one-third of iOS users have opted in to tracking.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/05/wsj-mobile-ad-spending\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"69fe14bbb49efc021b6c2a682c52984f21675a2d99eeca126c9ffed730c7f032","category":"Tech"}
