{"title":"Gurman: Combined HomePod/Apple TV Device Remains in Early Development","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/","date":1622206676000,"content":"Apple's work on a new combined <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> device is ongoing, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022\">Bloomberg</a></em> journalist Mark Gurman.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/HomePod-With-Screen-and-Arm-FaceTime-Feature-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-tv-combined-homepod-camera/\">previously reported</a>, Gurman reiterated that the new device will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/apple-is-rethinking-the-homepod/\">a built-in screen and a camera</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\">FaceTime calls</a>.<blockquote>As part of its broader home, audio and accessories strategy, Apple has also begun early development of a ‌HomePod‌ speaker with a built-in screen as well as a device that combines the features of a ‌HomePod‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> camera and ‌Apple TV‌, Bloomberg News has reported. Competition for speakers with screens is already widespread. Apple released a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> speaker last year and outlined a minor update to the ‌Apple TV‌ set-top box last month.</blockquote>The report suggests that, given the fairly minor update to the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-new-apple-tv-4k/\">announced last month</a>, the new combined ‌HomePod‌ device will represent a much more significant advancement in the ‌Apple TV‌ product line.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/\">explained in the past</a> that Apple is exploring a future high-end ‌HomePod‌ speaker that could include an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> connected via a robotic arm that tracks and follows users around a room.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple was planning to release an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-no-longer-planning-new-2022-homepod/\">updated HomePod model in 2022</a> as a successor to the 2017 ‌HomePod‌, but these plans were apparently shelved after the larger ‌HomePod‌ was outright discontinued. The company now appears to be focusing on this new combined HomePod-Apple TV product instead.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGurman's report earlier this morning also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">laid out Apple's plans</a> for third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> coming later this year and second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> coming in 2022 with health tracking features.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/\">Gurman: Combined HomePod/Apple TV Device Remains in Early Development</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-device-remains-in-early-development.2298245/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=COrN4GUB0XY:nHcvUW45m14:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=COrN4GUB0XY:nHcvUW45m14:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/COrN4GUB0XY\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"23bb7221ebc8a4c76e8149c15f09691d87e1d431133a52dafbd35436edb6d1ef","category":"Apple"}
