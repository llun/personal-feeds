They’ve remained an integral part of the team through 2016. In 2017 the team became WM3 and moved to Ridley, but Liv returned as bike supplier in 2019 under the name CCC-Liv. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liv is also sponsoring the highly anticipated Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our team was founded in 2009 and is deeply rooted in women’s cycling. Many of the team’s successes have been achieved together with Liv, and we are excited to begin this next phase together,” said Liv Racing WorldTeam manager Eric van den Boom. “Liv has shown time and again to be very involved in and supportive of women’s cycling — both on a recreational and a professional level. The level of ambition Liv has to advance women’s cycling is very high and matches well with the goals of this team.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 Liv Racing has notched a handful of impressive wins, most of them by Belgian national champion Lotte Kopecky. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipubTtwLTxAhWYAGMBHf66CyUQFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcyclingtips.com%2F2021%2F06%2Fliv-launches-new-langma-disc-brake-bike-for-2022%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw18-Oq30p2pyfPaPY-LH2Za\" target=\"_blank\">The new Liv Langma</a> and Kopecky recently won the Lotto Belgium Tour final stage and overall. Kopecky is slated to leave the team in 2022 for SD Worx, but this longstanding partnership with Liv will allow the WorldTeam to expand on their already impressive roster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our title sponsorship of the Liv Racing WorldTeam this year, and the expansion of our partnership going forward represents our commitment to creating more opportunities for women in professional road racing,” said Phoebe Liu, chief branding officer of Giant Group. “Liv works with women at every level of cycling, from beginners to the pro peloton. This partnership exemplifies how we work with our pro road team to create the most innovative performance products on the market for women, like our new 2022 Langma Advanced SL Disc. These riders are an essential component to our research, design and development process. We are proud of what we’ve accomplished and excited to continue to evolve our performance road products together.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/liv-to-sponsor-liv-racing-through-2024/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4de3d657b88f5e0c0fe05858b32173797ecee895aaf34955a13fa2fc9410d6eb","category":"Cycling"}
