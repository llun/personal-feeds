The YouTube account of Spinks' game dev company, Re-Logic, was hit with some kind of terms-of-service violation, resulting in Google banning Spinks' entire Google account, greatly disrupting his company's ability to do business. After three fruitless weeks of trying to get the situation fixed, Spinks <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661842147692549\">announced</a> that his company will no longer do business with Google and that the upcoming Stadia version of <em>Terraria</em> is canceled. \"I will not be involved with a corporation that values their customers and partners so little,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661843192012801\">Spinks said</a>. \"Doing business with you is a liability.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1354203035174633474\">Three weeks ago,</a> the official <em>Terraria</em> Twitter account publicly pleaded with YouTube for some kind of resolution to a recent Google account ban. The <em>Terraria</em> account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1354212973376634882\">explained</a>, \"We have not added anything new to our only YT channel (RelogicGames) in several months. However, we randomly received an email saying there was a TOS violation but that it was likely accidental and as such, the account would receive no strikes.\" The <em>Terraria</em> Twitter account continued, \"Three days later, the entire Google account (YT, Gmail, all Google apps, even every purchase made over 15 years on Google Play Store) was disabled with no warning or recourse. This account links into many business functions and as such the impact to us is quite substantial.\"</p>\n<p>Re-Logic's vague recollection of \"a TOS violation\" highlights one of the main frustration points of a Google account ban: you immediately lose access to your Gmail account, so you can't give a thorough account of what happened or what any communication said, because you can't read your email. Re-Logic's YouTube channel, which is still up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ReLogicGames/videos\">here</a>, (with a disabled profile picture) appears to be nothing but trailers of the company's games.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740488#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740488&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cfadab7f3ce11e11952f0935b93d0e11ca4a84aaa315c1de4fbfe35b8e99323","category":"Tech"}
