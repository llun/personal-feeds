Well, the Dutch pro is back at it again, this time racing Speecoâ€™s Aero Breakaway Handlebar at the Belgium Tour.</p>\n<p>The former track world champion is known for using a particularly narrow handlebar (narrow is aero, after allâ€¦) but Speecoâ€™s Breakaway steps things up when it comes to unconventional cockpit setups.</p>\n<p>In fact, van Schip developed the crazy handlebar in conjunction with Speeco, the Dutch company that launched the Breakaway in December 2020.</p>\n<blockquote><p>ðŸŽ¥: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sporza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sporza</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Y4gtGpECTD\">pic.twitter.com/Y4gtGpECTD</a></p>â€” BEAT Cycling (@beatcyclingclub) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beatcyclingclub/status/1403342116261175299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2021</a></blockquote><p>The one-piece, integrated handlebar features extended forearm supports, allowing van Schip to adopt an aerodynamic, flat-back position when riding on the hoods.</p>\n<p>As we know, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/uci-bans-supersapiens/\">UCI isnâ€™t averse to banning any new, unconventional technology</a>, so weâ€™re more than a little surprised that cyclingâ€™s world governing body hasnâ€™t outlawed the Breakaway bar. Yet.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Van Schip joined a five-rider breakaway on stage three.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Bas Czerwinski / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Van Schip, who rides for the UCI Continental-registered BEAT Cycling team, is using the handlebar on his Koga bike at the Belgium Tour and made a move into the breakaway on todayâ€™s third stage.</p>\n<p>The Breakaway features a short (for road bikes) 70mm, 17-degree stem as standard and flared drops, but the reach is customised.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Van Schip is known for typically using a super-narrow 32cm handlebar, as pictured.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Luc Claessen / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The handlebarâ€™s â€˜extensionsâ€™ have a concave shape to support the forearms. Despite the unconventional design, Speeco says the shifter position remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>Interested?
