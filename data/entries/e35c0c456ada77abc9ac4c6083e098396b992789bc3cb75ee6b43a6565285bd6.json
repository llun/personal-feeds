That will put webOS in direct competition with other platforms in use across TV brands, such as alternatives from Roku, Amazon, and Google.</p>\n<p>LG says \"over 20 TV manufacturers\" have \"committed to the webOS partnership\" and names RCA, Ayonz, and Konka as examples. They'll ship the OS in their TVs and, in so doing, gain access to voice control features, LG's AI algorithms, and a fairly robust library of already built streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube, or Disney+.</p>\n<p>For smaller manufacturers, this is more cost-effective than developing these features on their own or lobbying companies like Netflix or Disney to support new platforms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744799#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744799&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e35c0c456ada77abc9ac4c6083e098396b992789bc3cb75ee6b43a6565285bd6","category":"Tech"}
