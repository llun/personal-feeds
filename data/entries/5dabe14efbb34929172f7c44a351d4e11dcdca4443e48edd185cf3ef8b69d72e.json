I’m using a Halfords holder here, but any will do.</p>\n<ul><li>£33</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n\n<h2>Hammerhead Karoo 2 GPS bike computer</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Hammerhead-Karoo-2-7-e32e84f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Karoo 2 could be a real Garmin rival. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/06/Hammerhead-Karoo-2-9-605e034.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Karoo 2 uses a proprietary mount but can be adapted to Garmin-style ones</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>A number of brands have tried to challenge Garmin’s dominance of the GPS bike computer market, most notably Wahoo with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-v2/\">new Elemnt Bolt computer</a>, but the Karoo 2 from Hammerhead might be one of the most interesting rivals yet.</p>\n<p>This fully-featured computer has an ultra-crisp 3.2in colour touchscreen (along with physical buttons too), a claimed battery life of 12 hours, and all the connectivity you could possibly want – Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi, and the option to add a sim card too.</p>\n<p>It’ll also talk to electronic groupsets from the big three, plus other accessories such as Garmin’s Varia radar.</p>\n<p>The Karoo 2 ships with a sturdy-feeling proprietary out-front mount, but also includes an adapter to let it work with more common Garmin-style mounts.

stronger and lighter.</p>\n<p>The new valves are said to be 2g (yes, really) lighter than the old ones and they’re designed to work better with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/no-more-flat-tyres-three-puncture-preventers-tested/\">tyre inserts</a>, with slots machined into their bases to allow air and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tubeless sealant</a> flow even if there’s an insert getting in the way.</p>\n<p>The valves ship with three types of grommet to fit a variety of rim bed shapes, and an extra valve cap that doubles as a core removal tool.</p>\n<p>They’re available in lengths of 44mm, 60mm, and 80mm and come in a choice of ten colours.</p>\n<p>On my scales, these 60mm valves weigh 13g with the tool-cap installed.</p>\n<ul><li>£24.99</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n
