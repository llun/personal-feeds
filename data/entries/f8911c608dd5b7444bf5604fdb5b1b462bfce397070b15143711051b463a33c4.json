SpaceX needs this legal designation in some of the states where it won federal funding to deploy broadband in unserved areas. Dish asked the FCC to deny SpaceX the needed status in the 12 GHz band.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746518#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746518&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f8911c608dd5b7444bf5604fdb5b1b462bfce397070b15143711051b463a33c4","category":"Tech"}
