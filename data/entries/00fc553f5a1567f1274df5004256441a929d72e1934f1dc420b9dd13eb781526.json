More recently, series like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/littlebigplanet-3-single-player-impressions-waiting-for-the-internet/\"><em>Little Big Planet</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/dreams-ps4-world-premiere-hands-on-finally-a-good-3d-take-on-littlebigplanet/\"><em>Dreams</em></a> have shown just how powerful simple controller-based game creation tools can be, while experiments like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/01/kodu-beta-comes-to-the-pc/\">Kodu</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/10/project-spark-review-if-its-in-the-game-design/\">Project Spark</a> have failed to find the necessary audience to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Nintendo isn't new to this concept, either—the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/finally-you-can-build-an-entire-game-out-of-super-mario-maker-2-levels/\"><em>Mario Maker</em> series</a> and games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/03/warioware-diy-making-games-an-inch-wide-a-mile-deep/\"><em>WarioWare DIY</em></a> have given players robust creation tools to play with. But <em>Game Builder Garage</em> is Nintendo's most ambitious effort yet to let its users make games, using a coding-free environment built for the Nintendo Switch.</p>\n<h2>Meet the Nodons</h2>\n<p>The basic layout of <em>Game Builder Garage</em> will be familiar to anyone who has used visual programming tools <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\">Scratch</a> or the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/gorgeous-unreal-engine-4-brings-direct-programming-indirect-lighting/\">Unreal Engine's Kismet environment</a>. Instead of being built with lines of code, <em>Garage</em> games are made by placing and connecting little colored square beings called Nodons, which sit in the design space and distractingly blink their eyes at you every few seconds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768474#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768474&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00fc553f5a1567f1274df5004256441a929d72e1934f1dc420b9dd13eb781526","category":"Tech"}
