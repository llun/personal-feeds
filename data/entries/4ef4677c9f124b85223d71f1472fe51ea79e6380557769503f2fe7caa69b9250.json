The men didn’t like women racing at all. They didn’t want them to go riding through the night, it was expected that they sleep – but the clock wouldn’t stop”. </p>\n<p>With the shift north towards Bristol the wind was more obliging. They successfully navigated the city centre with support from Bristol club members and Boy Scouts. The shift up through the industrial heartland was marked by the onset of rain at Whitchurch. </p>\n<p>The Shap presented no obstacle; “my speed never dropped below 10mph, even over the final stiff incline for which I used my 72- inch gear”. </p>\n<p>She covered 432 miles in the first twenty-four hours before taking a break at Carlisle for “hot broth… a change of clothing… a blanket bath and a short nap of fifteen minutes”.</p>\n<p>At Beattock it rained and the wind shifted around, blowing down the climb. The challenge of the long slog wore away at her reserves of mental strength. </p>\n<p>“The editor of Cycling, H. H. England, was stood at the side of the road. He said, “I’m so sorry, Eileen” – he didn’t expect me to go on. I didn’t want to give up, but I was questioning myself: would I be strong enough?” </p>\n<p>It was in the balance, but she pressed on through the dark, before picking up pace as she rode towards Stirling. By late Saturday afternoon, the prospect of a second night weighed on the mind, with Drumochter summit “appearing like a monstrous forbidding shadow, streaked here and there with snowdrifts”. The headlamps from the following car threw shadows against the rock “like a huge cyclist going past”. </p>\n<p>Dawn at 1500 feet saw the temperature drop further, an intense frost causing painful feet. Frank gave her his socks, then waited barefoot for another pair to arrive with the caravan. Such are the privations – two nights without sleep and intense cold, a struggle for the helpers as well as the rider. </p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><p> </p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4ef4677c9f124b85223d71f1472fe51ea79e6380557769503f2fe7caa69b9250","category":"Cycling"}
