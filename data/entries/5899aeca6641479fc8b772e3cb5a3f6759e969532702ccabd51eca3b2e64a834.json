Think of them as a lighter and zippier wheelset for XC or riding where the terrain doesn&#8217;t demand stouter wheels. These wheels are made in the United States from the revolutionary &#8220;FusionFiber&#8221; material, which replaces resin with a nylon-like material. It combined with German and Japanese fibers results in a rim that is 100% recyclable. The RW27 offers the same flex as the RW30, but is 50g lighter. </p>\n<p>-27mm width<br />\n-29” rim diameter<br />\n-Available in 28H or 32H drilling<br />\n-Complete wheels or rim only<br />\n-Wheelsets available with 28H Industry 9 Hydra (1740g) or 1/1 hub (1770g) options<br />\n-XD or Microspline driver body options<br />\n-ERD: 592<br />\n-Rim depth 35mm<br />\n-Rim only weight: 430g<br />\n-Lifetime warranty<br />\n-Rim is recyclable FusionFiber material<br />\n-Recommended tire width 2.2-2.5”<br />\n-Rim only $699 &#8211; i9 1/1 wheelset $1975 &#8211; i9 Hydra wheelset </p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.revelbikes.com/our-bikes/revel-wheels-27/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Revel</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"5899aeca6641479fc8b772e3cb5a3f6759e969532702ccabd51eca3b2e64a834","category":"Cycling"}
