This could be just a general cleanup of the language because there's no real need to refer to it as the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote anymore, but it also suggests that the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote will not be called the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote and will have a simpler name.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe update renames the \"Home Button\" under the \"Remotes and Devices\" section to \"TV Button,\" but the functionality is ultimately the same and can be set to go to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app or the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOther new features include frame rate options of 29.97Hz and 59.94Hz instead of 30Hz/60Hz, an optional \"Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;\" Accessibility feature that can be enabled, which mirrors the Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature on iOS devices, a new option for choosing \"Other Wireless Speakers\" as the Default Audio Output, and tweaks to the Podcasts app to bring it in line with the changes introduced in iOS 14.5.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe release of tvOS will see Apple begin enforcing its new App Tracking Transparency rules, with developers now required to ask for and receive a user's permission to access their random advertising identifier (known as the IDFA) to track user activity across apps and websites for ad customization purposes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoing forward, when an app wants to access a person's advertising identifier on tvOS, users will have a prompt with options to \"Allow Tracking\" or \"Ask App Not to Track.\" Selecting \"Ask App Not to Track\" will prevent the app's developer from accessing the user's IDFA, and developers will also have to respect the user's tracking preference and refrain from using other invasive cross-app tracking methods.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe main <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a> update released in September brought expanded Picture in Picture support, new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> integration with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a> cameras, support for multiple &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; profiles, and more, with details available in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">our tvOS 14 roundup</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/apple-seeds-tvos-14-5-beta-6-to-developers/\">Apple Seeds Sixth Beta of tvOS 14.5 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-sixth-beta-of-tvos-14-5-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2290221/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=t6_ocCrXPdk:cjb5m2xAluk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=t6_ocCrXPdk:cjb5m2xAluk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/t6_ocCrXPdk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a798f694eb184a8b646b1b864fc8fdf947889065fd8b6b6f17fa906de9e59f0a","category":"Apple"}
