Gelsinger says the expanded capacity will take on manufacturing for third-party chip designers in addition to Intel's own CPUs—similar to the business model of TSMC, the Taiwan-based fabricator that builds processors for many \"fabless\" industry giants, including Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm.</p>\n<p>The move comes in sharp contrast to many analysts' predictions that Intel would spin-off silicon fabrication entirely. Intel has had great difficulty shrinking its manufacturing process beyond 14 nm, adding to its ability to keep up with AMD—which has benefited greatly from TSMC's successful process shrink to 7 nm.  Since then, TSMC has added volume production for 5 nm process, with a further shrink to 3 nm expected later this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751886#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751886&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2a24fc043676f5f2f5001c5c6106862c93ec12716aa1af27bd45f4bfe79a996","category":"Tech"}
