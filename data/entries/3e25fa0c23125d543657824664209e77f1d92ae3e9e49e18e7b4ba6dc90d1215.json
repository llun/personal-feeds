{"title":"Apple Pay Launch Appears Imminent in Israel","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/apple-pay-israel-rumors/","date":1614185550000,"content":"Apple Pay is likely a few days to a few weeks away from launching in Israel, according to local website <em><a href=\"https://theverifier.co.il/51867/pepper-add-support-for-apple-pay/\">The Verifier</a></em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/pepper-apple-pay-israel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785461\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe report notes that Israeli mobile banking service Pepper recently updated its iPhone app, with the release notes for the latest version mentioning a \"surprise\" that would be shared at a later time. Pepper may have accidentally jumped the gun, however, as the app briefly showed users a splash screen with an option to add the Pepper card to the Wallet app for use with Apple Pay. The screen is apparently no longer being shown.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis serves as pretty good evidence that Apple Pay will likely expand to Israel soon, after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-pay-launches-in-mexico/\">launching in Mexico</a> earlier this week. First introduced in 2014, Apple Pay is now available in over 50 countries or regions around the world.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/apple-pay-israel-rumors/\">Apple Pay Launch Appears Imminent in Israel</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-launch-appears-imminent-in-israel.2286040/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=x6ZQN64f2x4:I5JujJ2Tvx4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=x6ZQN64f2x4:I5JujJ2Tvx4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/x6ZQN64f2x4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3e25fa0c23125d543657824664209e77f1d92ae3e9e49e18e7b4ba6dc90d1215","category":"Apple"}
