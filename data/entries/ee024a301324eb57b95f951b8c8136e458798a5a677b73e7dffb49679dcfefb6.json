Bike choice is key, but there’s no perfect machine for an event like the Highland Trail 550 – as you’ll find out.</p>\n<p>Fifty-five riders took to the start line of the 2021 event. Here we bring you an in-depth look at three very different bikes that took first, third and fourth place overall.</p>\n<h2>Who won the 2021 Highland Trail 550?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Highland Trail 550 is the UK’s premier bikepacking race.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\"><strong>James Robertson</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>After opening up a 50-mile lead, the race was won in impressive style on Tuesday evening by Liam Glen, riding a rigid <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-fixies-and-singlespeed-bikes/\">singlespeed</a> Stooge Cycles Scrambler and finishing in a time of 3d 10h 55m – a new singlespeed record, and a time within spitting distance of the overall record.</p>\n<p>Second place was then taken by Andrew Hutcheson. Unfortunately, our photographer on the ground, James Robertson, was unable to catch him, with Andrew heading home shortly after his 02:14am finish.</p>\n<p>Third place went to 2017 Transcontinental winner James Hayden aboard a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-releases-carbon-version-of-neuron-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Canyon Neuron CF</a>, with Josh Ibbet, another former Transcontinental winner, taking fourth on an unreleased Mason Raw hardtail.</p>\n<p>The women’s field is currently led by Annie Le onboard her Salsa Spearfish. We’ll be keeping our ear to the ground as this group continues towards the finish in Tyndrum and will bring you a similar gallery if at all possible.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The race is defined by savage hike-a-bikes and gruelling river crossings in spectacular terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\"><strong>James Robertson</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>We’ve been following this year’s racing over on <a href=\"https://dotwatcher.cc/race/highland-trail-550-2021\">DotWatcher.cc</a> – which is one of our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-apps/\">favourite cycling apps</a> – and have been equally horrified and impressed by the biblical weather the riders have faced.</p>\n<p>This has been made all the more challenging due to covid restrictions – the route is usually served by a handful of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/uk-smallest-bothy-video/\">bothies</a> (small open-door mountain shelters), but these are currently closed due to the pandemic, leaving riders continually exposed to the elements.</p>\n<p>Good luck to all of the riders still out on the route and thanks to Liam, James and Josh for taking some time from (we assume) lying down very still and enjoying not being on the bike to let us get these photos</p>\n<h2>Liam Glen – Stooge Cycles Scrambler</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/03_Liam_Glen_HT550_Stooge_Scrambler-28d65f0.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Liam Glen took the overall win on his Stooge Cycles Scrambler.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\">\n                <strong>James Robertson</strong>\n            </a>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/02_Liam_Glen_HT550_Stooge_Scrambler-91f2ded.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The bike has a distinctive twin-plate crown.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\">\n                <strong>James Robertson</strong>\n            </a>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/01_Liam_Glen_HT550_Stooge_Scrambler-c58204c.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Liam used a mix of luggage from Apidura and other brands, as well as his own homemade frame pack.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\">\n                <strong>James Robertson</strong>\n            </a>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/08_Liam_Glen_HT550_Stooge_Scrambler-b8c69ae.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Scrambler has a distinctive twin top tube, which gives plenty of locations to secure luggage.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\">\n                <strong>James Robertson</strong>\n            </a>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/05_Liam_Glen_HT550_Stooge_Scrambler-41bf0b5.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The fact that Liam won onboard a singlespeed bike makes his victory all the more impressive.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\">\n                <strong>James Robertson</strong>\n            </a>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/10_Liam_Glen_HT550_Stooge_Scrambler-b54d37f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>His bike is also hardly at the cutting-edge of tech, and is mostly made up from older parts.

This allows the bike to easily accept the largest frame bag possible.</p>\n<p>Liam has made full use of this available space, producing his own framepack to go with the bike.</p>\n<p>This is a seriously slick looking bit of kit, suggesting he’s as much of a maestro on the <a href=\"https://www.gathered.how/sewing-and-quilting/sewing/best-sewing-machines-for-beginners-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">sewing machine</a> as he is on the pedals.</p>\n<p>The rest of the build – and we don’t think Liam would mind us describing it as such – is a lovable hodge podge of simple and dependable kit.</p>\n<p>Looking back through his Instagram, most of the build appears to have been taken from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BedkTQll1Si/\">his old On-One Inbred</a>. The rear wheel was only borrowed in the days leading up to the race.</p>\n<p>His make-do-and-mend approach is a refreshing contrast to the flashy-shiny-go-fast pro kit we usually feature on BikeRadar, and serves as an important reminder that you don’t need the latest and greatest kit to perform well.</p>\n<h3>Liam Glen’s custom Stooge Cycles Scrambler spec highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Stooge Cycles

This, in the words of Mason, is designed to “deliver a springy, propulsive and soothing ride quality”.</p>\n<p>In a first for the brand, the Raw is manufactured in the UK, with fabrication sub-contracted out to Fiveland Bikes.</p>\n<p>In terms of geometry, the bike is designed to strike a balance between singletrack shredding ability while remaining “stable and safe” when loaded with bikepacking kit.</p>\n<p>The bike is outfitted with a full suite of Miss Grape bikepacking bags and is built around a 120mm-travel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-rockshox-sid-ultimate-fork-review/\">RockShox SID fork</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Josh is a hugely experienced ultra-distance racer and former Transcontinental winner.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://www.jamesrobertson.co.uk/\"><strong>James Robertson</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>A really neat custom bag support made from a thin alloy plate is fitted to the fork. This presumably mounts using an expanding bung fitted to the underside of the fork crown, which is pre-loaded with the top cap seen in the photos above. This should stop the bag from bouncing or swaying on rough descents.</p>\n<p>Lighting Josh’s way was an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/11spd/11spd-this-weeks-best-new-bike-gear-102/\">Exposure Revo dynamo light</a> powered by an as-of-yet unreleased <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/mtb-axle-standards/\">Boost-spaced</a> version of SON’s legendary dynamo hub.</p>\n<p>This is laced to a pair of carbon rims that Hunt has confirmed are still in the prototype stage. A pair of 2.25in WTB Ranger tyres are fitted to these.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for a full news story on this prototype bike in the next few days.</p>\n<h3>Josh Ibbet’s unreleased Mason Raw spec highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Unreleased Mason Raw hardtail frame</li>\n<li>RockShox SID Ultimate fork</li>\n<li>Shimano XT groupset</li>\n<li>ESI silicone groups</li>\n<li>WTB Volt saddle</li>\n<li>Shimano SLX Trail brakes</li>\n<li>X-Fusion Manic dropper post</li>\n<li>Prototype Boost-spaced SON dynamo light</li>\n<li>Prototype Hunt carbon rims</li>\n<li>Exposure Revo headlight</li>\n</ul>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ee024a301324eb57b95f951b8c8136e458798a5a677b73e7dffb49679dcfefb6","category":"Cycling"}
