Now a new rumor supplies a possible date: May 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LukeMiani/status/1392965631641853959&amp;xcust=1-1-346526-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple-centric YouTuber Luke Miani tweeted</a> a cryptic “May 18” on Thursday afternoon,  Internal Store followed up with the following tweet:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>AirPods 3.<br /> Music+.<br />May 18th.<br />Press Release.<br />6:00 AM (PST).</p>— Internal Store (@InternalStore) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/InternalStore/status/1393008113498804226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-346526-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 14, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p>That’s pretty confident. We’re a little skeptical that Apple would announce a new product during the same week that a bunch of new products is shipping, but on the other hand, new AirPods and an enhanced Apple Music+ pair nicely with the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343706/ipad-pro-2021-faq-price-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344032/apple-24-inch-imac-display-m1-specs-storage-ports-ram-ethernet-colors-touch-id.html\">24-inch iMac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need more fuel to this rumor fire, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2021/05/14/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-streaming/&amp;xcust=1-1-346526-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">9to5Google has spotted references</a> to “<em>Lossless audio files</em>” in the most recent Apple Music APK for the Google Play Store. Specifically, Apple warns about data usage, telling users that songs will take up “significantly more space” and “consume significantly more data” than the standard files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As previously rumored, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/339494/multiple-sources-claim-airpods-3-wont-be-part-of-apples-march-event.html\">the third-generation AirPods were a last-minute scratch</a> at Apple’s Spring Loaded event. They are expected to look more like the AirPods Pro with shorter stems but probably won’t bring noise-cancelation. The Apple Music+ service will reportedly up the quality from the current bitrate of 256kbps to more than a thousand kilobits per second, which should make a huge difference in streaming quality, especially when using AirPods or a HomePod speaker.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f5a42ee68312cfe033fd33a099354d576015a82f07be96887c50921a116b0b6e","category":"Apple"}
