Eddy Merckx's <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> record of 34 stage wins looked impregnable until seven days ago. But here we are just six stages into this year's Tour and there is now a genuine possibility that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\">Mark Cavendish</a> could take the record outright.</p>\n<p>Yesterday's win felt different to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/9810/gallery-mark-cavendishs-fairytale-tour-de-france-victory\">that of two days ago</a>. With the Stage 4 win into Fougères came tears, emotions, relief. Like a pressure cooker had been opened and years of frustration and anger had been lifted from Cavendish's shoulders.</p>\n<p>On Stage 6 into Châteauroux, we saw the old Cavendish both off and on the road.</p>\n<p>On it, it was not just the fact he was the fastest man in the race that impressed, it was his decision making that stood out. Making the split-second call not to follow teammate Michael Morkov, he instead jumped on to the wheel of Jasper Philipsen, a decision that ultimately earned him victory. That is a sign that Cavendish is back.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9141/mens-worldtour-team-bikes-2021-a-breakdown\">Men's WorldTour team bikes 2021: a breakdown </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 115: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nOff it, it was a vintage Cavendish performance in the press conference: forensic recall of the Châteauroux finish line of 13 years previous, questioning the motives of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/groupama-fdj\">Groupama-FDJ</a> and Arkea-Samsic, jousting with the interviewer over the name that shall not be mentioned.</p>\n<p>'Don't say the name, don't say the name!' Cavendish said in relation to Merckx.</p>\n<p>'I'm not thinking about anything. Again, I just won a stage of the Tour de France. If that was my first stage or if that was my 32nd stage, I'd just won a stage of the Tour. That's what people work their whole lives for. I'm very, very happy, that's all I've got to say.</p>\n<p>'If I'm good enough to win 50 more, I'm good enough to win 50 more. If I'm good enough never to win again here, so be it.'</p>\n<p>It is only natural we mention Merckx though, <em>isn't it</em>? </p>\n<p>Below, Chris Auld's images from Stage 6:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9822/tour-de-france-stage-6-gallery#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 15</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cauldphoto-tdf-stage6-9816.jpg?itok=5vjl26Mx\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>15</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9822/tour-de-france-stage-6-gallery\">Tour de France Stage 6 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>2 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9822%2Ftour-de-france-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%20Stage%206%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9822%2Ftour-de-france-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%20Stage%206%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9822%2Ftour-de-france-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%20Stage%206%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9822%2Ftour-de-france-stage-6-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9822/tour-de-france-stage-6-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 15</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/cauldphoto-tdf-stage6-9837.jpg?itok=-gMVFz9k\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9e9e631aa71bcbd2813fc2db7e421ab0fda6a441bf2dd071cea14995b6bf89a8","category":"Cycling"}
