Like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/exploring-epic-games-stores-biggest-sale-yet-coupons-and-steam-comparisons/\" target=\"_blank\">last year's deals event</a>, the sale also <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/coupons/mega-sale\" target=\"_blank\">includes a recurring coupon</a> that takes $10 off any eligible game priced at $14.99 or more after existing sale discounts. You'll have to be signed in to an Epic Games account to access this feature, but once used, the coupon will immediately reset and become usable for your next purchase of a game priced at $15 or more. There's no way to stack multiple coupons for one purchase, but Epic says anyone who has pre-purchased a game that launches during the sale will get a $10 refund to account for the coupon when said game comes out. The company says the Mega Sale will last until June 17.</p>\n<p>While the Epic Games Store still isn't quite as robust or well-stocked as Steam—and while we expect Valve's storefront to launch its own annual Summer Sale sometime in the coming weeks—this sales event includes good discounts on several games we like, including former <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Game of the Year winners <em>Hades</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2019/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Control;</em></a> the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/loop-hero-review-ive-somehow-gotten-hooked-on-an-rpg-that-plays-itself/\" target=\"_blank\">recently Ars Approved <em>Loop Hero</em></a>; widely heralded titles like <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Outer Wilds;</em> and blockbusters like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/red-dead-redemption-ii-review-getting-muddy-in-the-wide-open-frontier/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/a-week-spent-in-cyberpunk-2077s-beautiful-messy-urban-future/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/death-stranding-is-kojima-unleashed-and-its-as-weird-as-youd-expect/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>. Also of note, <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/nba-2k21\" target=\"_blank\"><em>NBA 2K21</em></a> is currently available at no cost until May 27, at which point Epic will roll out a new free game. We've picked out a sampling of steeper-than-usual discounts below.</p>\n<p>If you can't stand the thought of adding even more games to your backlog, our curated deals roundup also includes sales on Apple's Mac Mini, various iPads and Roku media streamers, Fitbit's Sense smartwatch, microSD cards, portable batteries, and more.
