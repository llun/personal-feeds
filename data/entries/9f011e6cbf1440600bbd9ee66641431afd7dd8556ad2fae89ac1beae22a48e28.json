On first appearance the Hannah Enviolo could simply be another step-through framed city bike – it’s that simple-looking.</p>\n<p>But to describe as simple is to do it a gross injustice. The Hannah not only hides its electric credentials but incorporates many clever features too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://velorution.com/schindelhauer-hannah-enviolo.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Schindelhauer Hannah Enviolo e-bike now from Velorution</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>For starters there’s no need to worry about a messy, oily chain. In place of this, there is a Gates CDX belt drive that works with an Enviolo variable transmission built into the rear hub.</p>\n<p>This clever hub will ensure that you always get the maximum benefit from the Bosch Performance Line motor tucked away in the base of the aluminium frame between the cranks.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/schindelhauer_hannah_enviolo_review_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Similarly, the matching Bosch Powertube battery is hidden away in the frame, as are the brake cables.</p>\n<p>That concept of keeping everything integrated extends beyond the obvious motor and battery to the mudguards and lights.</p>\n<p>The Hannah’s Wingee mudguards not only help protect the rider from road dirt and rain but carry the assimilated Supernova lighting system too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://velorution.com/schindelhauer-hannah-enviolo.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Schindelhauer Hannah Enviolo e-bike now from Velorution</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>That’s not the only trick in the Wingee’s bag: the stays for the rear mudguard do double duty as mounting points for bags. Should you want to carry heavier items, Schindelhauer also offers the option of a luggage rack for the front of the Hannah.</p>\n<p>Given that the Hannah will mostly be ridden on city streets, the use of large-profile WTB tyres is a wise choice because the generous capacity of the wide tyres will easily deal with the worst potholes and bumps.</p>\n<p>However, if you need to stop quickly to avoid a hazard the Shimano disc brakes won’t let you down.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9543/the-top-10-riders-from-the-2021-spring-classics\">The top 10 riders from the 2021 Spring Classics</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9211/tom-pidcock-and-the-case-of-his-curious-5km-run\">Tom Pidcock and the case of his curious 5km run</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8672/tom-pidcock-wins-baby-giro-ditalia-title-after-dominant-performance\">Tom Pidcock wins Baby Giro d'Italia title after dominant performance</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Schindelhauer Hannah Enviolo specs</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated weight:</td>\n<td>24.7kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame material</td>\n<td>6061 T6 aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Motor</td>\n<td>Bosch Performance Line (Cruise)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Bosch Powertube 500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated range</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gearing</td>\n<td>Shimano, Enviolo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Fabric Scoop Shallow Sport</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bars</td>\n<td>Satori Seagull</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>Alexrims EXR25 650b</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyres</td>\n<td>WTB Horizon 650b x 47c</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.schindelhauerbikes.com\" target=\"_blank\">schindelhauerbikes.com</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9f011e6cbf1440600bbd9ee66641431afd7dd8556ad2fae89ac1beae22a48e28","category":"Cycling"}
