Canalys pointed out that the significant\nincrease in Apple’s notebook and tablet shipments in India was due\nmainly to Apple opening its online store in September 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Research firm IDC’s figures also show Apple’s PC shipments in\nIndia (excluding tablets) grew 335.5% on year in the first quarter\nand only lagged Asustek’s by around 2,000 units.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>iPhone sales in India are up too, but these numbers are about the Mac and (I think) iPads. A lot has changed for Apple in the last 20 years, but one thing remains unchanged: they sell more products when they have their own stores, online or physical.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/28/apple-india-market-share\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"00ebb74ca9c5ee9644ac4e1427542a945b040a97d2155efc2c45f26979db0ec4","category":"Tech"}
