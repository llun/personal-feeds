Doyon now faces all of the original charges for coordinating a 2010 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Orbit_Ion_Cannon\">High Orbit Ion Cannon</a> (HOIC) DDoS attack on servers belonging to Santa Cruz, California, plus a serious new charge for jumping bail.</p>\n<p>This has been a surprising turn of events for the homeless hacktivist, who spent his years first in Canada and then in Mexico issuing press releases, hanging out on Twitter, writing a self-published memoir, appearing in documentaries, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/anon-on-the-run-how-commander-x-jumped-bai/\">meeting up with journalists like me</a>â€”all without apparent response from the US government.</p>\n<p>All that changed on June 11, when Doyon was arrested by Mexican police. This was confirmed by a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-mountain-view-resident-christopher-doyon-apprehended-mexico-and-returned-united\">press release</a> from the US Attorney for the Northern District of California, where Santa Cruz is located, though no details were provided.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774127#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774127&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bd277e4c341eebc330c643ae8df547cb5b3a4acb84ef3137f00acfa28fbeceb0","category":"Tech"}
