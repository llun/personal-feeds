{"title":"iOS 15 Brings FaceTime to PC and Android Users With New Option to Join on the Web","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/facetime-pc-android-users-ios-15/","date":1623101549000,"content":"With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, iPadOS 15, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> updates, Apple is expanding the reach of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> by allowing anyone, even those without Apple devices, to join a ‌FaceTime‌ call.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/facetime-new-features.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn ‌iOS 15‌ and its sister updates, you can create a link to a ‌FaceTime‌ conversation that can be shared anywhere. Using this link, friends and family members who do not have an Apple device can log into a ‌FaceTime‌ call using a web browser.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNon-Apple users can join a one-on-one ‌FaceTime‌ call or a Group ‌FaceTime‌ call, effectively making ‌FaceTime‌ a more platform-agnostic video service that is no longer just limited to iOS users. You do, however, need an iOS user to start a ‌FaceTime‌ call and send a link.<blockquote>Invite anyone to join you in a ‌FaceTime‌ call, even friends who don't have an Apple device.2 They can join you for one-on-one and Group ‌FaceTime‌ calls right from their browser instantly -- no login necessary.</blockquote>Apple says that non-Apple users can join calls using the newest versions of Chrome or Edge. Sending video requires H.264 video encoding support.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are a ton of other updates and improvements to ‌FaceTime‌, including Spatial audio support, Portrait mode support, Voice Isolation mode for drowning out background noise, Grid view for seeing all participants, and a new SharePlay feature that's designed to let you watch movies, listen to music, and share your screen with friends and family members.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/facetime-pc-android-users-ios-15/\">iOS 15 Brings FaceTime to PC and Android Users With New Option to Join on the Web</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-brings-facetime-to-pc-and-android-users-with-new-option-to-join-on-the-web.2299635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C9xIystihkU:yC4otCKxImw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C9xIystihkU:yC4otCKxImw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/C9xIystihkU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bc4848847c9ac40d31a6d37fe89ecf27c2ab3c2191cd3d785ea0d044a7d002c6","category":"Apple"}
