{"title":"Encrypted Messaging App Signal Stops Working in China","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/signal-messaging-app-banned-china/","date":1615890312000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/signal-icon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"243\" height=\"242\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-774988\" />Encrypted messaging app <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a> appears to have been banned in China, reports <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/signal-is-down-in-china/?guccounter=1\">TechCrunch</a></em>. While the app remains available in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, the service is no longer operational in mainland China, according to the censorship tracking website <a href=\"https://en.greatfire.org\">Greatfire.org</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWestern-run social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have been unavailable in the country for some time, but Signal has largely flown under the radar of China's authorities until now. Signal has yet to comment on the issue.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's unclear what has caused the country's government to act and whether the ban is permanent, however Signal and rival service Telegram have both recently experienced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/messaging-app-signal-sees-surge-signups/\">significant uptick in users</a> following WhatsApp's bungled PR campaign explaining its upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp-privacy-policy-data-sharing-facebook/\">privacy policy update</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLike Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp are still listed on the China &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, although access to the services requires the use of VPNs â€“ another category of apps that local authorities have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/03/popular-mobile-vpn-services-shut-down-in-china/\">cracked down on in recent years</a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nVPNs circumvent China's \"Great Firewall\" by routing and encrypting internet traffic to servers outside of the country, making them popular with privacy-conscious users who have limited access to online content because of government restrictions. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/signal/\">Signal</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/signal-messaging-app-banned-china/\">Encrypted Messaging App Signal Stops Working in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/encrypted-messaging-app-signal-stops-working-in-china.2288483/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wjDWLTIL-wc:VdVUsmb63tI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wjDWLTIL-wc:VdVUsmb63tI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wjDWLTIL-wc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8ca5fb96d23fd01ac2c172931220ede466303cabeaa5f6166d42fd0af1586490","category":"Apple"}
