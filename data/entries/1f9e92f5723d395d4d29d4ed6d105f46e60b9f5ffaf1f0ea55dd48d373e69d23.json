These include local details, such as the stars that have passed through an area from which something would <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/who-could-know-were-here-on-earth/\">be able to detect Earth</a>. And it includes far larger structures, like the trails of stars left behind by smaller galaxies that have merged with our own.</p>\n<p>But one feature we've discovered has been a bit confusing: trails of stars that are too small and thin to have come from a galaxy collision. There are dozens of them that we've not identified a source for. Their size suggests they came from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster\">globular cluster</a>, but there's no obvious mechanism for these clusters to eject stars at a rate sufficient to generate this sort of stream.</p>\n<p>Now, a team of researchers has suggested a not-so-obvious mechanism: Over time, clusters may become dominated by black holes that eject all the stars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778619#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778619&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f9e92f5723d395d4d29d4ed6d105f46e60b9f5ffaf1f0ea55dd48d373e69d23","category":"Tech"}
