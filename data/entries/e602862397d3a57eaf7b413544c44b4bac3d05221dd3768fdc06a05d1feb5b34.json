They found that this detail improved both aerodynamics and rolling resistance and allows the rider to run lower tyre pressures, making it even smoother and faster.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/equipment/cycling-components/bike-wheels/carbon-wheels/c/E433/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy Bontrager Aeolus RSL wheels now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Adding that all up, Bontrager claims that in a typical Mads Pederson sprint the new RSL 62 TLR saves 34 Watts over the XXX 6 Tubular and a rider leading the peloton on the RSL 51 TLR will save 6.3 watts over the XXX 4 Tubular.</p>\n<p>On top of the design revolution, the new wheels use Trek's lightest and strongest RSL-level OCLV (Optimum Compaction Low Void) Carbon and the extra lightweight Ratchet EXP freehubs with DT Swiss 240s internals.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9484/bontrager-aeolus-rsl-images#16\"><p><span>Image 17 of</span> 40</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/bontrageraeoluspro51tlrdiscroadwheel_34499_b_alt2.png?itok=z9jHQO44\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 17 of </span>40</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Also released alongside the RSL wheels is the Aeolus Pro 51, which uses most of the same technology at a more accessible price point, as was seen with the Pro 37 released last year alongside the RSL 37. The Pro 51 has a slightly lower level Pro OCLV Carbon and comes with DT Swiss 350 hubs.</p>\n<h3>Specs</h3>\n<p>The Bontrager Aeolus RSL wheels are available in four depths with each designed for specific ride types: the ultralight 37mm for climbing; 51mm for speed and stability in all conditions; 62mm for sprinters and speed merchants; and 75mm for <a href=\"/tags/time-trial\">time-trials</a> and triathlons.</p>\n<p>All the wheels are disc and TLR clincher only and can be easily set tubeless with rim strips or tape. They are also sold individually and have the same shape for front and rear meaning you can mix and match – Stuyven set out with a 62 front and 75 rear in Milan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/equipment/cycling-components/bike-wheels/carbon-wheels/c/E433/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy Bontrager Aeolus RSL wheels now</strong></em></a></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9510/scottish-cyclist-to-attempt-record-for-furthest-distance-cycled-in-a-week\">Scottish cyclist to attempt record for furthest distance cycled in a week</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9395/goodwood-to-host-duchenne-dash-charity-challenge-in-july\">Goodwood to host Duchenne Dash charity challenge in July</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/rapha/9021/rapha-black-friday-ride-raises-over-130000-for-charity\">Rapha Black Friday Ride raises over £130,000 for charity</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9240/how-to-ride-your-first-century-tips-for-beginners-to-reach-100-miles\">How to ride your first century: Tips for beginners to reach 100 miles</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nRecommended tyre size for the new wheels is 25c and although rolling resistance improves slightly at 28c, the brand says it leads to slightly increased drag.</p>\n<p>Bontrager offers a lifetime warranty with every carbon wheelset and its Carbon Care Wheel Loyalty Program provides a free replacement for any riding damage within the first two years.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/aeolus-rsl-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">trekbikes.com</a></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong></strong></td>\n<td><strong>RSL 51</strong></td>\n<td><strong>RSL 62</strong></td>\n<td><strong>RSL 75</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Pro 51</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rim depth</td>\n<td>51mm</td>\n<td>62mm</td>\n<td>75mm</td>\n<td>51mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inner rim width</td>\n<td>23mm</td>\n<td>23mm</td>\n<td>23mm</td>\n<td>23mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight (per wheelset)</td>\n<td>1,410g</td>\n<td>1,520g</td>\n<td>1,645g</td>\n<td>1,590g</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price</td>\n<td>Front: £899.99; Rear: £1,099.99</td>\n<td>Front: £899.99; Rear: £1,099.99</td>\n<td>Front: £899.99; Rear: £1,099.99</td>\n<td>Front: £549.99; Rear: £649.99</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9484/bontrager-aeolus-rsl-images\">Bontrager Aeolus RSL images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>13 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9484%2Fbontrager-aeolus-rsl-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Bontrager%20Aeolus%20RSL%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9484%2Fbontrager-aeolus-rsl-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Bontrager%20Aeolus%20RSL%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9484%2Fbontrager-aeolus-rsl-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Bontrager%20Aeolus%20RSL%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9484%2Fbontrager-aeolus-rsl-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9484/bontrager-aeolus-rsl-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 40</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/bt21_aeolus_rsl_51_domane.jpg?itok=bR09fWEk\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/wheels\">Wheels</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e602862397d3a57eaf7b413544c44b4bac3d05221dd3768fdc06a05d1feb5b34","category":"Cycling"}
