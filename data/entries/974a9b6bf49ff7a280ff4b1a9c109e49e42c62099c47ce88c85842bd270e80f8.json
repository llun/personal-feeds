Today, the company announced the next device in its flagship foldable-smartphone line: the <a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/mate-x2/\">Huawei Mate X2</a>. While 2019's Mate X (X1?) was an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/huaweis-foldable-mate-x-finally-hits-the-market-after-five-months-of-delays/\">innovative-but-impractical form factor</a> with a single wraparound display on the outside of the phone, the Mate X2 follows Samsung's lead and goes with a book-style foldable with a rigid phone screen on the outside and a foldable tablet screen on the inside. It looks just like a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-is-official-its-2000-and-ships-9-18/\">Galaxy X Fold 2</a> but with a few interesting design evolutions.</p>\n<p>Huawei spent a lot of time saying the Mate X2 was better than the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, pointing out bigger interior and exterior screens as well as a smaller hinge area with slimmer bezels on the front. One thing Huawei didn't compare is the price, which starts at a whopping $2,784, while the Galaxy Fold 2 is $2,000.</p>\n<p>The exterior screen is a 6.45-inch, 2700×1160, 90Hz OLED, while the interior screen is an 8-inch, 2480×2200, 90Hz OLED. Both are bigger than those in the Fold 2, which has a 6.2-inch outside display and a 7.6-inch inside display. Huawei's work to slim down bezels looks impressive, and it really feels like the company got the aspect ratios right. Huawei managed to fit a bog-standard 21:9 display on the front—it looks like a normal smartphone from some angles. The interior display is nearly two 21:9 display put together, with what Huawei called a \"8:7.1 aspect ratio.\" It's hard to say what the interior aspect ratio \"should\" be, since Android tablet apps are nearly nonexistent, but at least this will be good for split-screen app usage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744188#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744188&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"974a9b6bf49ff7a280ff4b1a9c109e49e42c62099c47ce88c85842bd270e80f8","category":"Tech"}
