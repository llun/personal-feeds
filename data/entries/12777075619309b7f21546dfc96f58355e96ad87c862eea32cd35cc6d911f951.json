Now I get what he was talking about.'\"</p>\n<p>\"The answer you expect\" would probably be \"we're sticking with PC games,\" so any answer involving console plans would definitely be unexpected. But the lack of specifics in Newell's statement has left a lot of Valve-watchers guessing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764492#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764492&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12777075619309b7f21546dfc96f58355e96ad87c862eea32cd35cc6d911f951","category":"Tech"}
