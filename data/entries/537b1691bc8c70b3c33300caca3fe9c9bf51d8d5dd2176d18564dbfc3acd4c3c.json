Before Scott’s departure, Jaime Waydo, who led autonomous car safety and regulation teams, departed to become the chief technology officer at Cavnue, a startup focused on the safety of autonomous cars on public roads.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn February, Benjamin Lyon, who helped create Apple’s original car team several years ago and was key in the future project’s development, left to become the chief engineer at Astra, a company developing technology for sending satellites to space.</blockquote>Over the last few months, a flurry of reports have surfaced detailing potential specifics on an ‌Apple Car‌. <em>Bloomberg</em> has previously reported that the self-driving vehicle is still in early development and is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-launch-5-to-7-years-away/\">still at least five years away</a>, while reliable Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes that the vehicle is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/27/kuo-apple-car-2025-2027-at-earliest/\">unlikely to launch until 2025 at the earliest</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the recent departure of some top-level managers from the project, Apple has added notable executives to \"Project Titan.\" In February, the Cupertino tech giant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/apple-car-chassis-porsche-vp-hire/\">hired a former Porsche executive</a> with experience in chassis design.
