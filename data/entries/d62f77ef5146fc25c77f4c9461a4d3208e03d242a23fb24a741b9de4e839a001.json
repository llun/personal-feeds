{"title":"Apple Previews New Accessibility Features, Including an Astonishing AssistiveTouch Feature for Apple Watch","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/","date":1621460183000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Later this year, with software updates across all of Apple’s\noperating systems, people with limb differences will be able to\nnavigate Apple Watch using AssistiveTouch; iPad will support\nthird-party eye-tracking hardware for easier control; and for\nblind and low vision communities, Apple’s industry-leading\nVoiceOver screen reader will get even smarter using on-device\nintelligence to explore objects within images. In support of\nneurodiversity, Apple is introducing new background sounds to help\nminimize distractions, and for those who are deaf or hard of\nhearing, Made for iPhone (MFi) will soon support new\nbi-directional hearing aids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My spidey-sense has been suggesting that next month’s WWDC is going to be a big one, jam-packed with announcements. Here’s our first evidence: a slew of  very good accessibility features that apparently didn’t make the cut for the keynote. All of this stuff would have been great in a keynote.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To support users with limited mobility, Apple is introducing a\nrevolutionary new accessibility feature for Apple Watch.\nAssistiveTouch for watchOS allows users with upper body limb\ndifferences to enjoy the benefits of Apple Watch without ever\nhaving to touch the display or controls. Using built-in motion\nsensors like the gyroscope and accelerometer, along with the\noptical heart rate sensor and on-device machine learning, Apple\nWatch can detect subtle differences in muscle movement and tendon\nactivity, which lets users navigate a cursor on the display\nthrough a series of hand gestures, like a pinch or a clench.\nAssistiveTouch on Apple Watch enables customers who have limb\ndifferences to more easily answer incoming calls, control an\nonscreen motion pointer, and access Notification Center, Control\nCenter, and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Stop what you’re doing, follow the link to Newsroom, and watch the video demonstrating this feature. This is really hard to believe. It makes Apple Watch very accessible to, say, someone who only has one arm, or who for whatever reason can’t use their non-watch hand to touch the watch with accuracy. Wow.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/19/apple-new-accessibility-features\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d62f77ef5146fc25c77f4c9461a4d3208e03d242a23fb24a741b9de4e839a001","category":"Tech"}
