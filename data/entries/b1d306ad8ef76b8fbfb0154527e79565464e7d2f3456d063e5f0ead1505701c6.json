Victims automatically received the malicious packages, with no social engineering or trojans required.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBirsan was able to create counterfeit projects using the same names on open-source repositories, each containing a disclaimer message, and found that applications would automatically pull public dependency packages, without needing any action from the developer. In some cases, such as with PyPI packages, any package with a higher version would be prioritized regardless of wherever it was located. This enabled Birsan to successfully attack the software supply chain of multiple companies.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nUpon verifying that his component had successfully infiltrated the corporate network, Birsan reported his findings to the company in question, and some rewarded him with a bug bounty. Microsoft awarded him its highest bug bounty amount of &#36;40,000 and released a white paper on this security issue, while Apple told <em>BleepingComputer</em> that Birsan will receive a reward via the Apple Security Bounty program for responsibly disclosing the issue. Birsan has now earned over &#36;130,000 through bug bounty programs and pre-approved penetration testing arrangements.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA full explanation of the methodology behind the attack is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610\">available at Alex Birsan's <em>Medium</em> page</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cybersecurity/\">cybersecurity</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bug-bounty/\">bug bounty</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/researcher-breaches-systems-of-over-35-companies/\">Researcher Breaches Systems of Over 35 Companies, Including Apple, Microsoft, and PayPal</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/researcher-breaches-systems-of-over-35-companies-including-apple-microsoft-and-paypal.2284132/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lz-fSpAd7aI:x9xqCAAwQTA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lz-fSpAd7aI:x9xqCAAwQTA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lz-fSpAd7aI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b1d306ad8ef76b8fbfb0154527e79565464e7d2f3456d063e5f0ead1505701c6","category":"Apple"}
