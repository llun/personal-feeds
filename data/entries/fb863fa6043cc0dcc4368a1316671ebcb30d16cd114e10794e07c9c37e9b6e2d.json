(credit: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us\">Microsoft</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Ahead of Xbox's next major game-reveal event, slated to air online this Sunday, the console-maker's leadership team hosted an hour-long press briefing about how its business has been doing alongside hints of what to expect beyond specific games. Though the presentation was the kind of ham-fisted, Xbox-biased stuff you'd expect from an internal production, it still included a few compelling reveals and statements—and I'm saving you an hour of your life by breaking them out from the rest of the Xbox-and-pony show, now that the embargo has lifted.</p>\n<p>Most of the event's biggest announcements, unsurprisingly, revolve around the wildly successful <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=ArsGamePassE32021&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Game Pass</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/bethesdas-leap-to-xbox-game-pass-adds-12-classics-morrowind-oblivion-more/\">subscription service</a>—and new ways to access its wealth of over 200 games, particularly via <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/stadia-what-xbox-game-streaming-will-become-part-of-game-pass-in-2020/\">the Azure-powered cloud-gaming library</a> (available as part of Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions). That's assuming your <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/google-stadia-might-be-gamings-future-but-in-the-present-it-looks-rough/\">bandwidth</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/google-stadia-in-4k-might-push-you-past-your-home-internet-data-cap/\">monthly caps</a> are up to snuff, at least.</p>\n<p>Microsoft's execs confirmed plans to roll out a smart TV app for Xbox cloud gaming, which will allow interested Game Pass subscribers to access Xbox's cloud-hosted games using nothing more than their Internet connection and a compatible gamepad. The presentation didn't confirm which \"global TV manufacturers\" will support the app or whether these efforts would lead to more streamlined ways to install the service's TV-specific app on existing streaming sticks. (And we have no idea when those apps will roll out; MS didn't offer even a vague estimate like \"this year,\" which means <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/18-months-after-launch-google-stadia-now-supports-android-tv/\">Google Stadia will likely beat Xbox on this TV-specific front</a>.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771960#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771960&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb863fa6043cc0dcc4368a1316671ebcb30d16cd114e10794e07c9c37e9b6e2d","category":"Tech"}
