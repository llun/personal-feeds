It's a simple app that adds additional sharing utility for those who need it.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.postbox-inc.com\">Postbox</a></strong> (&#36;40) - Postbox bills itself as a \"Power Email\" app with a built-in Message Triage feature for quickly getting through what's in the inbox. There's a Quick Bar with a series of quick actions for dealing with emails, a built-in unsubscribe feature, gesture support, filters, and deep organization to keep everything where it belongs. There are also quick reply features, canned responses, search tools, professional email examples, quick-insert clips, signatures, image effects, and more. There are also anti-tracking features to let you know if emails contain tracking tools.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://stclairsoft.com/Jettison/\">Jettison</a></strong> (&#36;4.95) - Jettison is a simple little app that's designed to eject all external drives automatically when you put your MacBook to sleep.

A menu bar addition counts down the time to your next meeting or event, and lets you know when it's time to join. Multiple calendar accounts and subscriptions are supported so you can see everything you need to do at a glance. Superpowered has a free trial, but costs &#36;10 per month after that.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br/>\r\nKnow of a must-have Mac app or game that we haven't highlighted yet?
