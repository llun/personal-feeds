Due later this year, the software updates will introduce major new features to notifications and other parts of the experience.</p>\n<p>In the age of coronavirus, FaceTime is, unsurprisingly, getting new features to make conversations more natural. A new spatial audio feature will make it sound like \"people are in the same room.\" Callers' voices will come from the same direction as their thumbnails. Machine-learning-powered voice isolation will block out background sounds, while a \"wide spectrum\" mode will pick up everything in the room.</p>\n<p>Grid view will let you view FaceTime calls just like Zoom. Portrait mode will blur out your background, just like a camera mode. You can also generate a link for a FaceTime call, making it work, again, just like joining Zoom. FaceTime is even coming to Android, sort of, via a browser. A new feature called \"Shareplay\" will let you share media or your device screen over the video call.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770202#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770202&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85a33c41520f159591eb4cbdc4bdfe083dd9dd70233e7782a4d0aafaa5b3b425","category":"Tech"}
