Asahi Linux is a fledgling distribution founded with the specific goal of creating a workable daily-driver Linux experience on Apple M1 silicon.</p>\n<p>This is a <em>daunting</em> task. Apple does not offer any community documentation for Apple Silicon, so Martin and cohorts must reverse-engineer the hardware as well as write drivers for it. And this is especially difficult considering the M1 GPU—without first-class graphics support, Asahi cannot possibly offer a first-class Linux experience on M1 hardware such as the 2020 M1 Mac Mini, Macbook Air, and Macbook Pro.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756008#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756008&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8248c371d9e1b7b213fc4ba2c3eaed5afe725f3cc71e313c17004f88868b0064","category":"Tech"}
