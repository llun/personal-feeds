Not for Lael Wilcox, however, who took on the XL at this year’s Unbound Gravel. The XL traverses 358 miles (576km) of the Flint Hills out of Emporia, Kansas, all self-supported and just as hard as years prior. </p>\n<p>We’d like to congratulate Lael, who finished in 26 hours, 55 minutes; the first woman and 10th overall.
