Not only does this result mark yet another year of domination for Martin, but it is also his 50th time trial (or prologue) victory since turning pro in 2008, four of them World Championship titles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CORVOS_00033238-012-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Lisa Brennauer (Ceratizit-WNT) wins the time trial at the German National Championships.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fellow former world champion Lisa Brennauer (Ceratizit-WNT Pro Cycling) claimed her fourth ITT national title on the same 30.5 km route. Brennauer finished with a time of 40:33, going 31 seconds faster than defending champion Lisa Klein (Canyon-SRAM), whose 21-year-old teammate Hannah Ludwig took third 1:01 down. The fourth-place finisher came in 1:43 slower than Ludwig, which goes to show the strength of the elite women’s podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brennauer will attempt to do the double at Sunday’s road race, which would be her third consecutive national road title and the fourth of her career.</p>\n<br /><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/martin-and-brennauer-both-add-another-german-itt-title-to-their-palmares/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"617160cf1bddf6cf7145615d6c43ef40bdc3516152ac993c103607f830279c8f","category":"Cycling"}
