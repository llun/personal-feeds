This would mark the first update to the standard AirPods since March 2019, when the second-generation pair launched with the H1 chip for hands-free \"Hey Siri\" functionality and up to 50 percent more talk time than the original AirPods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe second-generation AirPods are priced at $159 with a wired charging case and at $199 with a wireless charging case, and the third-generation AirPods would maintain a lower price than the AirPods Pro, which cost $249 regularly but are frequently on sale. It's likely that the third-generation AirPods will lack some higher-end features like active noise cancellation to maintain this lower price point.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the AirPods Pro, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">second-generation pair with fitness tracking</a> are rumored to launch next year, and they may have a more compact design similar to Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/beats-studio-buds-launch/\">Beats Studio Buds</a> released earlier this month.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/new-airpods-substrate-shipments/\">New AirPods Expected Later This Year as Suppliers Begin Component Shipments</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-expected-later-this-year-as-suppliers-begin-component-shipments.2302033/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gCFdr72XTQk:zKiPs9AhMjE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gCFdr72XTQk:zKiPs9AhMjE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gCFdr72XTQk\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fab0f490f9c2257bedc945773c8e3f9fd4e1b3246a3a9363df058ab5d163fd1","category":"Apple"}
