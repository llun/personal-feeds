Initial plans called for the digital pass to launch at the end of March, but undisclosed reasons pushed the release into mid-Apri.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe app will show whether a person has tested positive for COVID-19 and may become the international standard for proving someone has been vaccinated.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKamil Alawadhi, IATA's regional VP for Africa and the Middle East, says the new app will only become valid when counties, airports, and airlines adopt it and make it a requirement. Already, UK-based airline Virgin Atlantic said that it would begin a trial of the pass with a flight on April 16 from London to Barbados, which will require travelers to present upon arrival.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/iata-covid-19-travel-passport-app-april/\">Airline Body IATA to Launch COVID-19 Travel Passport App in April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airline-body-iata-to-launch-covid-19-travel-passport-app-in-april.2290194/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AJ-ACcwVm4Y:ALNl8QEwWcc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AJ-ACcwVm4Y:ALNl8QEwWcc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AJ-ACcwVm4Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"55a68c703e09ec31c7bd2e9c39e33f30ffbb83db3f87c88f7cc70f6f29f45405","category":"Apple"}
