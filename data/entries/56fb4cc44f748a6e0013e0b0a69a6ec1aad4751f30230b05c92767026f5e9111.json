These programs apparently worked as intended during a heat wave in which the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) <a href=\"http://www.ercot.com/news/releases/show/233037\">requested</a> that thermostats be set at 78° F (26° C) or higher to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/texas-grid-operator-ercot-urges-energy-conservation-amid-forced-outages-2021-06-14/\">cut electricity use</a>.

English said he unenrolled the family's thermostat from the program after discovering that it was being operated remotely.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775142#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56fb4cc44f748a6e0013e0b0a69a6ec1aad4751f30230b05c92767026f5e9111","category":"Tech"}
