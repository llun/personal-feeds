{"title":"Acorn 7.0","link":"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/","date":1618091509000,"content":"\n<p>Beautiful update to my favorite image editor. Big new features include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A unified document window, where the tools (which used to be in floating palettes) are built right into the document window itself. (There’s also a preference setting if you still want them as palettes.)</li>\n<li>Native Apple Silicon code.</li>\n<li>A new “Command Bar”, that is sort of like Spotlight <em>but just for Acorn</em>. You pop up the Command Bar with Shift-Command-O and type what you’re looking for — you get instant results for Acorn commands <em>and</em> Acorn’s excellent Help documentation. (BBEdit and Nova both have features similar to this; it’s a great way to expose a deep professional app’s many commands to the keyboard without asking the user to memorize dozens of distinct shortcuts.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://shapeof.com/archives/2021/3/acorn_7.html\">Acorn author Gus Mueller’s write-up on his blog</a>, and the copiously-detailed <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">Acorn release notes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Acorn is usually $40, but is currently on sale for just $20 — a veritable steal for a pro tool like this — <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">at Flying Meat’s website</a> and <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/appstore/\">on the Mac App Store</a>. 14-day free trial, too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/10/acorn-7\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0cecc675a2be27898a8d31f789902641007928f23815b14ab0e90fe9315720f0","category":"Tech"}
