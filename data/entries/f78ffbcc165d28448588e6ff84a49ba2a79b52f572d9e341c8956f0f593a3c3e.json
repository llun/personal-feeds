That's about $25 off its usual street price online, almost $40 off Razer's MSRP and, outside of a couple of brief drops to $80, the second-lowest price we've tracked. While it's still pretty expensive, the Viper Ultimate is currently our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/finding-the-best-wireless-mouse-for-your-desktop-for-both-work-and-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top recommendation among wireless gaming mice</a>: it offers an ultralight (74 g) and ambidextrous design, a number of easily customizable settings, and supremely accurate performance. If you're interested in a premium wireless mouse but would prefer a less flat design, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2P3TYBG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Razer's Basilisk Ultimate</a> offers similar performance and is also on sale for about $30 off. Just note that neither mice connects over Bluetooth, so you'll need a free USB-A port to use either device's wireless receiver.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, our deals roundup includes an ongoing sale on Sony's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outstanding WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones</a>, a <a href=\"https://fave.co/2PvsGUR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rare 30 percent off sale</a> on Away luggage gear, the lowest price we've tracked on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/half-life-alyx-review-the-greatest-vr-adventure-game-yet-and-then-some/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">excellent VR game <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>, deals on good portable SSDs, and much more.
