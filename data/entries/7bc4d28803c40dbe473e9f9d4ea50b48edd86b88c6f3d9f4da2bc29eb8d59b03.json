The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text#toc-HED684F5FC4AE4EE38E13A40FEF27CDE7\">fund</a> is part of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319\">$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan stimulus</a> sent to President Joe Biden yesterday after being approved by the House and Senate. Biden <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-signs-covid-relief-bill-american-rescue-plan/\">signed</a> the bill into law today.</p>\n<p>The emergency fund should help students who live in areas where broadband is available but cannot afford it. This emergency measure may just be a prelude to a $94 billion broadband package that includes $80 billion to deploy high-speed broadband to parts of the US that do not have it.</p>\n<p>Democrats introduced the $94 billion broadband initiative yesterdayâ€”it isn't yet clear whether or when it will pass, but such initiatives have a much better chance now that Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress. More details on the larger broadband bill are included later in this article.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748971#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748971&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7bc4d28803c40dbe473e9f9d4ea50b48edd86b88c6f3d9f4da2bc29eb8d59b03","category":"Tech"}
