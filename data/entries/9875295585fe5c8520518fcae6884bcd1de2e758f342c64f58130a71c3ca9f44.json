Developers also have access for a new integration to develop features for the Start Page.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe update includes optimizations for using iOS apps on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs. When running <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> apps on &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs, there's a Touch Alternatives preference pane that allows users to set keyboard commands for touch input alternatives, plus iPadOS apps launch with a larger window if the Mac's display allows it. Touch Alternatives can be enabled for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps by clicking on the app's name in the menu bar and then selecting the Preferences option. Touch Alternatives let you customize taps, swipes, and drags. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 also adds support for the latest PlayStation 5 DualSense and Xbox Series X/S controllers for use with macOS games.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the Reminders app, reminder lists can be sorted by Due Date, Creation Date, Priority, or Title, and there is an option to print lists by going to File > Print. Reminders can also be moved manually across lists with drag and drop, something that wasn't possible before.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is adding a new \"Made For You\" library shortcut in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> for finding personal mixes and Replay playlists, and the Listen Now section has been updated with support for highlighting live events.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are new sorting options in the Reminders app along with options to print, and &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; has been updated with a Made for You shortcut and a live events option in the Listen Now section.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/\">Apple News</a> app, there's a redesigned &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ tab with a dedicated \"For You\" section and a new Browse tab that makes it easier to browse through available content. The new For You section is designed to help &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ users find favorite magazines and newspapers much faster, plus it adds new tools for managing downloaded issues.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/02/macos-big-sur-11-3-beta-brings-new-support-menu-with-details-on-warranty-coverage-and-applecare/\">9to5Mac</a></em> discovered that &zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 includes an updated \"Support\" interface when accessing \"About This Mac.\" The new design includes details on your warranty and it allows for starting a repair right from the Mac interface.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/macos-11-3-warranty.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781622\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe tab will work similarly to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a> coverage menu in the iOS Settings app, which lets users request repairs, buy an &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; plan, and check their coverage. This updated support menu is not visible in the first beta of &zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3, but it could come at a later date. There are also signs that Apple may be planning to bring a support app to the Mac.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.3 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/macos-11-3-homepod-stereo-pairs/\">adds support</a> for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> Stereo pairs, allowing a set of paired HomePods to be set as the default sound output option, with the two HomePods showing up as a single selectable speaker rather than separate as in prior versions of macOS.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/apple-seeds-first-macos-big-sur-11-3-public-beta/\">Apple Seeds First Public Beta of macOS Big Sur 11.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-public-beta-of-macos-big-sur-11-3.2283366/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QP53Xl3_x2U:SyN77Qh-Ats:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QP53Xl3_x2U:SyN77Qh-Ats:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QP53Xl3_x2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9875295585fe5c8520518fcae6884bcd1de2e758f342c64f58130a71c3ca9f44","category":"Apple"}
