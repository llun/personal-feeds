Sales on these devices are hitting at &#36;20 off across the board, although the HyperDrive 4-in-1 USB-C Hub is seeing only a &#36;10 discount.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHyper's hubs plug into one (or both) of the MacBook Pro's USB-C ports, providing extra ports like HDMI, microSD, USB-A, and more. There are also options that connect to the iPad Pro and provide similar port additions, and even include a 3.5mm headphone jack.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-4-in-1-usb-c-hub-for-ipad%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3D4-in%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0\">HyperDrive 4-in-1 USB-C Hub for iPad Pro/Air</a> - &#36;39.99, down from &#36;49.99</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-solo-hub-for-usb-c-macbook-pc-devices%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3Dsolo%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0\">HyperDrive SOLO 7-in-1 USB-C Hub</a> - &#36;59.99, down from &#36;79.99</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-6-in-1-hub-for-ipad%3F_pos%3D3%26_psq%3D6-in-1%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0\">HyperDrive 6-in-1 USB-C Hub for iPad Pro/Air</a> - &#36;69.99, down from &#36;89.99</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fnew-2020-hyperdrive-duo-7-in-2-usb-c-hub\">HyperDrive DUO 7-in-2 USB-C Hub</a> - &#36;79.99, down from &#36;99.99</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-power-9-in-1-usb-c-hub-for-mac-pc-android-usb-c-devices%3F_pos%3D4%26_psq%3Dpower%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0\">HyperDrive POWER 9-in-1 USB-C Hub</a> - &#36;79.99, down from &#36;99.99</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-viper-10-in-2-usb-c-hub%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3Dviper%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0\">HyperDrive VIPER 10-in-2 Docking Station</a> - &#36;99.99, down from &#36;119.99</li></ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>MagSafe Charger</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple launched the MagSafe Charger last year alongside the new iPhone 12 line of smartphones. The device is a wireless charger that aligns perfectly with the latest iPhones, but it'll still work with iPhone 8 and later devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nToday on Amazon we're seeing one of the first discounts on the accessory, priced at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG\"><strong>&#36;34.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;39.00.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafe-arrival-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3414\" height=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-765325\" /><div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;5 OFF</div>MagSafe Charger for &#36;34.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlthough this is just a &#36;5 discount, Apple's first party accessories typically don't see steep markdowns this early in their lifespan.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Apple Watch Series 6</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nNext, you can get the (Product)RED <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=macrumors-20&geniuslink=true&th=1\">40mm GPS Apple Watch Series 6</a> for &#36;339.00, down from &#36;399.00. The Space Gray and Blue color options are slightly higher at &#36;349.00, but all are in stock and ready to ship today.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-watch-series-6-red-sale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782822\" /><div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=macrumors-20&geniuslink=true&th=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;60 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm GPS) for &#36;339.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis is &#36;10 off from the lowest price that we've ever tracked for this model of the Apple Watch Series 6, so it's a solid deal if you're shopping for the wearable in February. In regards to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5Y89C7?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1\">44mm GPS models</a>, you'll find about &#36;49 off the Blue and (Product)RED color options.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Magic Keyboard</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nLastly, Amazon is still discounting a few of Apple's keyboards for the iPad Pro and iPad Air, with the best sale centering on the Magic Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Pro at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for this Magic Keyboard, which can also be used with the fourth generation iPad Air.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/magic-keyboard-100-off.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1778\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-779847\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can also get the Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but this discount isn't quite as steep. It's priced at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F794B?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"><strong>&#36;329.70</strong></a>, down from &#36;349.00. Both versions of the Magic Keyboard provide a full keyboard with a trackpad, backlit keys, and a new floating cantilever design that lets you adjust the iPad Pro to find the best viewing angle.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;100 OFF</div>Magic Keyboard (11-Inch) for &#36;199.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor even more deals related to the iPad, head to our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-deals/\">Best Deals guide for iPad</a>.
