A new study finds the cuttlefish can delay gratification—a key feature of the famous \"marshmallow test.\" (credit: Alexandra Schnell)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Certain species show a remarkable ability to delay gratification, notably great apes, corvids, and parrots, while other species do not (such as rodents, chickens, and pigeons.) Add the cuttlefish to the former category.</p>\n<p>Scientists administered an adapted version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment\">Stanford marshmallow test</a> to cuttlefish and found the cephalopods could delay gratification—that is, wait a bit for preferred prey rather than settling for a less desirable prey. Cuttlefish also performed better in a subsequent learning test, according to a new paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. It's the first time such a link between self-control and intelligence has been found in a non-mammalian species.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/r-i-p-walter-mischel-father-of-the-infamous-marshmallow-test/\">we've previously reported</a>, the late Walter Mischel's <a href=\"https://bingschool.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/115-dev_psych_1990.pdf\">landmark behavioral study</a> involved 600 kids between the ages of four and six, all culled from Stanford University's Bing Nursery School. He would give each child a marshmallow and give them the option of eating it immediately if they chose. But if they could wait 15 minutes, they would get a second marshmallow as a reward. Then Mischel would leave the room, and a hidden video camera would tape what happened next. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746506#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746506&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d21a98e2f07f9eb5a579ec1c7606355c4a7c0b15056e15991a9b6865a472cd75","category":"Tech"}
