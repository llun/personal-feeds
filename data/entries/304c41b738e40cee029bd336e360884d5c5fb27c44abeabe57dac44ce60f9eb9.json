For more advice on the key features to look out for, we’ve got a full buyer’s guide towards the end of this article.</p>\n<h3>Lightweight fabrics</h3>\n<p>Summer cycling shorts use lightweight, stretchy and breathable fabrics, and are typically constructed from multiple panels to provide a comfortable, anatomical fit.</p>\n<p>These are neatly stitched together with thoughtfully located flatlock seams to provide maximum comfort while offering support. Your shorts should feel skintight and supportive, without causing any discomfort.</p>\n<h3>Chamois pad</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A good quality chamois pad is key to comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudrey / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Padded cycling shorts will feature a chamois stitched inside the shorts to provide relief and comfort around the sit bones.</p>\n<p>Not all pads are created equal and finding a design that works for you is crucial to long-term comfort.</p>\n<p>Once again, the fit should be snug to avoid chafing, while a breathable pad will help keep things good downstairs.</p>\n<p>Most pads vary the density and thickness of padding through the chamois to provide support where it’s needed most, while some use gel inserts in a bid to improve comfort.</p>\n<h3>Comfortable bib straps</h3>\n<p>Bib straps are designed to help keep your bib shorts in place, without the need for an uncomfortably tight waistband.</p>\n<p>The stretchy straps need to be tight enough to hold your shorts in place securely, but not be so tight that they make putting the shorts on difficult or uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>If possible, we’d recommend trying shorts on for size before you make a purchase.</p>\n<h3>Leg grippers</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Leg grippers are designed to stop the shorts riding up.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudrey / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Leg grippers help keep the ends of the shorts in place while pedalling, ideally providing a secure fit without causing discomfort.</p>\n<p>There are a number of ways to achieve this, from a simple silicone strip or elasticated band on more affordable shorts to a laser-cut hem backed with a sticky fabric on high-end shorts.</p>\n<p>Read to the end for our full buyer’s guide to cycling shorts.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>The best cycling bib shorts in 2021</h2>\n<p>Here are 21 of the best cycling bib shorts for men in 2021, as rated and reviewed by BikeRadar.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Assos Mille GT Summer Bib Shorts GTS: </strong>£165 / $230 / AU$330 / €190</li>\n<li><strong>Endura FS260-Pro SL II Long Leg Bib Shorts:</strong> £120</li>\n<li><strong>Giordana FR-C Pro Bib Shorts:</strong> £100</li>\n<li><strong>Rapha Core Cargo Bib Shorts:</strong> £110 / $150 / AU$195 / €135</li>\n<li><strong>7Mesh MK3 Bib Shorts:</strong> £150 / $200 / €175</li>\n<li><strong>Assos Equipe RS Bib Shorts S9:</strong> £175 / $260 / AU$370 / €200</li>\n<li><strong>Assos T.Equipe Evo Bib Shorts:</strong> £150</li>\n<li><strong>Castelli Free Aero Race 4 Kit Bib Shorts:</strong> £150 / $200 / €170</li>\n<li><strong>Decathlon Triban RC 100 Bib Shorts:</strong> £25 / $40</li>\n<li><strong>dhb Aeron Bib Shorts:</strong> £80 / $106 / AU$145 / €90 </li>\n<li><strong>Endura FS260-Pro Bib Shorts:</strong> £85</li>\n<li><strong>Endura Pro SL Bib Shorts:</strong> £120 / $195 / €140</li>\n<li><strong>Le Col Pro Bib Shorts:</strong> £160 / $230 / AU$300 / EU€190</li>\n<li><strong>Lusso Carbon v2 Bib Shorts:</strong> £95 / $132 / AU$170 / €110 </li>\n<li><strong>Sportful Total Comfort Bib Shorts:</strong> £130</li>\n<li><strong>Alé PRR Green Bib Shorts:</strong> £145 / $175 / AU$220 / €145</li>\n<li><strong>Altura Race Bib Shorts:</strong> £89 / €100</li>\n<li><strong>Castelli Endurance 3 Bib Shorts:</strong> £130 / $160 / AU$200 / €130</li>\n<li><strong>Fizik Link R3 Snake Bib Shorts:</strong> £165</li>\n<li><strong>Pearl Izumi Interval Bib Shorts:</strong> £150 / $150 / AU£$279.95 </li>\n<li><strong>Q36.5 Salopette Dottore L1 Bib Shorts:</strong> £247 / €246</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Assos Mille GT Summer Bib Shorts GTS</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The superlative MILLE GT bibs are aimed at the racer who demands top performance for long days in the saddle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> XS–XXXL</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Black</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £165 / $230 / AU$330 / €190 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Assos Mille GT Summer GTS Bib Shorts are the second generation of the premium Mille shorts, aimed at rider’s who demand top performance for long days out.</p>\n<p>The bib shorts have an all-new design that makes them suitable for wearing in the heat of summer.

Delivering exceptional comfort, they led us to ask whether they are the perfect set of cycling shorts.</p>\n<p>7Mesh has made these shorts from Miti Gravity Interpower, which is 38 per cent elastane and 62 per cent warp knit nylon. The result is a fabric that is super-soft against the skin and is slightly compressive, aiding blood flow and reducing fatigue in the legs as a result.</p>\n<p>The seat pad uses a high-density foam that has been designed to reduce numbness in the perineum area, and almost completely eliminates any unwanted pressure.</p>\n<p>Up top, the shoulder straps aren’t excessively tight, giving you room to move, but they still hold the shorts perfectly in place. They are also thin enough to let any heat dissipate.</p>\n<p>Overall, if you’re looking for a sleek set of shorts with superb comfort and excellent quality, you can’t go wrong with these bibs.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/road-cycling-shorts/7mesh-mk3-bib-shorts-review/\">Read the full 7Mesh MK3 Bib Shorts review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Assos Equipe RS Bib Shorts S9</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> One of the best fitting shorts and worth the outlay.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Sizes:</strong> S–XXXL</li>\n<li><strong>Colours:</strong> Black, Black/White, Black/Red, Black/Green</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £175 / $260 / AU$370 / €200 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Assos combines a minimalist approach with technology in these lightweight bibs.

Extra material up front provides added comfort for man bits.</p>\n<p>The bib system sees the rear straps attach lower down the back to hold the seat pad in position. This works well at stabilising, even when getting out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>The three-layer perforated waffle foam S9 pad has a micro-shock core and soaks up vibrations admirably.

Many people worry about looking silly, for example.</span></p>\n<p><span>There isn’t really an argument against that particular point, but, in our opinion, the performance difference is very much worth it, and the comfort levels are much higher. </span></p>\n<p><span>Lycra shorts offer a number of advantages over normal clothes or even the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-shorts/\">best mountain bike shorts</a>. These advantages include better aerodynamic efficiency, better breathability and an ability to dry more quickly, and less chance of chafing or your shorts getting snagged on your saddle.</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, though, you should ride in whatever you feel most comfortable and confident in. If you prefer baggy shorts over your padded shorts, then that’s good too.</span></p>\n<h3>Should you wear underwear under your cycling shorts?</h3>\n<p><span>In short, no. This is because the pads in padded cycling shorts are designed to sit directly next to your skin.</span></p>\n<p><span>For a detailed explanation on this subject, see our article on </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/should-i-wear-underwear-under-padded-cycling-shorts/\"><span>should I wear underwear under padded cycling shorts?</span></a></p>\n<h3>Bib shorts versus waist shorts</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most cyclists prefer bib shorts, which use straps to provide a secure, comfortable fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudrey / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The general consensus among dedicated cyclists is clear: bib shorts are better than waist shorts.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shorts-are-superior-to-bib-shorts/\"><span>Not everyone agrees</span></a><span>, but most find that shorts with bib straps tend to stay in place better than shorts without.</span></p>\n<p><span>The added tightness in the vertical plane helps pull the chamois up into your body, preventing it sagging away from you when you stand up on the pedals. This means less shifting around and more consistent pad placement, and ultimately comfort. </span></p>\n<p><span>It also does away with the need for a tight, high waistband, instead putting the emphasis on the elasticated shoulder straps to keep everything in place. This can enable the use of a slightly lower front panel as well, for increased ventilation.</span></p>\n<h3>What is a chamois pad?</h3>\n<p><span>A chamois pad, or seat pad, is the saddle-shaped padding usually found in cycling bib shorts. They are called a “chamois” because, back in the olden days, they used to literally be made from chamois leather, which is named after the European mountain goat it’s derived from.</span></p>\n<p><span>Today, they’re usually made from a combination of synthetic, multi-density foams and fabrics. These are designed not only to provide some cushioning for your derriere, but also to wick sweat away to help keep your crotch area dry and healthy.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A chamois pad is sewn onto the inside of cycling bib shorts to increase comfort and help wick sweat away from your body.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bend-in-the-road-proper-chamois-placement-is-key/\"><span>Proper placement of the pad is key</span></a><span>, so it’s worth taking into consideration the type of riding you’ll be doing. Cyclists taking part in time trials or triathlons, with aggressive, forward positions, need much more padding around the front than mountain bikers, who are likely to be sat more upright.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, you also need a good saddle, and performance-oriented saddles tend to be firmer than you might expect because they’re designed with cyclists wearing padded shorts in mind. Read our guide on </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-choose-a-bike-saddle/\"><span>how to choose a bike saddle</span></a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Do you need to use chamois cream?</h3>\n<p><span>Potentially. If you’re getting on just fine without it, then there’s no need to start using it.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you experience any chafing or saddle sores though, a good quality, cycling-specific<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-chamois-creams/\"> chamois cream</a> (or simply a generic antibacterial barrier cream) can help prevent infections and reduce friction. We have a guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-avoid-and-treat-saddle-sores\">how to avoid and treat saddle sores</a>. </span></p>\n<h3>How much money should you spend?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Good quality – and comfortable – bib shorts needn’t cost the Earth.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>As with many things in life, you do get what you pay for to a certain extent.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re going to be doing really long days in the saddle or using your cycling shorts fairly regularly then spending a bit more is likely to get you a more comfortable, more durable pair of shorts.</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, if you just want something for short commutes or weekend rides then one of the top-rated</span> <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-womens-cycling-shorts/\">cheap women’s bib shorts</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-cycling-shorts/\">men’s bib shorts for cycling on a budget</a> as tested by our expert reviewers will do the job, and do it well.</p>\n<p><span>Like with bikes, though, once you get above a certain price point (around £75 / $95 / €85), the returns on your investment do start to get more marginal. </span></p>\n<p><span>That’s not to say those gains won’t be worth it for some riders, but we’d certainly be happy riding all day in Lusso’s Carbon v2 Bib Shorts as mentioned above, for example.</span></p>\n<p><span>Above this price, you’re paying for more modest improvements such as big-name brand labels, more technical fabrics that take into account things such as weather protection and aerodynamics, and often nicer styling.</span></p>\n<h3>What colour shorts should you get?</h3>\n<p><span>For a long time, black was the go-to colour for many riders. But over recent years brands have provided more and more options, with blue, grey and dark green being common choices. </span></p>\n<p><span>Bib shorts remain pretty plain but that does make it easier to pair them up with more <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-jerseys/\">jerseys</a>. </span></p>","author":"Ian Osborne","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"304c41b738e40cee029bd336e360884d5c5fb27c44abeabe57dac44ce60f9eb9","category":"Cycling"}
