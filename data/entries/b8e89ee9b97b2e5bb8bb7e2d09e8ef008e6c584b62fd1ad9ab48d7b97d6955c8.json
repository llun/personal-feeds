A meeting of the G20 next month is expected to continue the talks with a wider group of nations, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, and Turkey.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAny broader, final agreement could have repercussions for low-tax countries and tax havens, such as Ireland, where Apple is headquartered outside the U.S. Low-tax countries are expected to try to build support for a minimum rate as close as possible to around 12.5 percent or seek exemptions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmerican multinationals play a significant role in Ireland's economy, attracted by the country's \"BEPS\" tools, that protect their nonâ€“U.S. profits from the U.S. \"worldwide\" corporate tax system, and provide an effective Irish tax rate of zero to 2.5 percent. As a result, large multinational companies, particularly in the technology industry, such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, are expected to be heavily impacted by the new international tax plans.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe agreed minimum corporation tax rate of 15 percent is still above the level in countries such as Ireland, but below the lowest level in the G7. The 15 percent rate is lower than the 21 percent that was expected ahead of the summit, and some countries, such as France, are arguing that the 15 percent rate should be viewed as a base level for setting a higher, more ambitious rate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA move toward making companies declare their environmental impact in a standardized way, primarily so that it is clearer to investors, was also agreed upon.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/corporate-tax/\">corporate tax</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tax/\">tax</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/05/big-tech-to-be-hit-by-international-tax-agreement/\">Big Tech Companies to Be Hit by 'Historic' International Tax Agreement</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/big-tech-companies-to-be-hit-by-historic-international-tax-agreement.2299293/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0jwPqb3qzzI:RnZrucSYo3Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0jwPqb3qzzI:RnZrucSYo3Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0jwPqb3qzzI\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b8e89ee9b97b2e5bb8bb7e2d09e8ef008e6c584b62fd1ad9ab48d7b97d6955c8","category":"Apple"}
