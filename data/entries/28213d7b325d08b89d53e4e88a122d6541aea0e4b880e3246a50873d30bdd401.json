If a site offers two-factor authentication, you can set up verification codes under Passwords in Settings -- no need to download an additional app. Once set up, verification codes autofill when you sign in to the site.</blockquote>Apple says that you can set up verification codes under Passwords in the Settings app, and once set up, verification codes will autofill when you sign into a site, which will make using two-factor authentication on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> much more streamlined.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis feature is available on ‌iOS 15‌, iPadOS 15, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-built-in-password-authenticator/\">iOS 15 Includes Built-In Password Authenticator With Autofill, Replacing Google Authenticator and Authy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-includes-built-in-password-authenticator-with-autofill-replacing-google-authenticator-and-authy.2299594/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I_gD4UMsLOE:oM5wUeUCl30:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=I_gD4UMsLOE:oM5wUeUCl30:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/I_gD4UMsLOE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"28213d7b325d08b89d53e4e88a122d6541aea0e4b880e3246a50873d30bdd401","category":"Apple"}
