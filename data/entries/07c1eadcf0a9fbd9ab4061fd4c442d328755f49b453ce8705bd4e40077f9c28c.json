By utilizing dynamic head tracking, it brings a theater-like audio experience to the movie or video you're watching, so that it seems as if the sound is coming from all around you.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/spatialaudiofeature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1598\" height=\"898\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-758736\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe feature works by comparing the data from your iOS device's gyroscope and accelerometer against the data from your ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>‌ Pro or &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, ensuring that the sound field stays anchored to the device, even if you move your head. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nUnsurprisingly, spatial audio isn't universally supported by third-party apps and services.
