According to Pole, the Voima is the only eMTB currently using this high-grade material. All manufacturing is done in Finland.</p>\n<p>The new bike has a whopping 190mm of travel, via elevated chain and seat stay linkage design.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Pole Voima is the Finnish brand’s first-ever electric mountain bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pole Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>In the downtube sits a large 725Wh battery for the Brose S Mag motor, which pumps out up to 90Nm of torque. The motor is almost fully enclosed within the frame.</p>\n<p>The battery is installed from the top of the downtube, rather than from below as per most eMTBs around.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike uses a new Brose S Mag motor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pole Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>These design features are used as, according to Pole, many electric bike failures are as a result of water and dirt ingress.</p>\n<p>By enclosing the motor, forming the battery’s opening on the top of the downtube and placing charging hardware high up by the headtube, this is reduced.</p>\n<p>The 190mm of suspension gives a clear indication that Pole wants this bike to be ridden hard – as does the ability of the bike to be run with dual crown forks (as we’ve seen with bikes such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-habit-neo-and-moterra-e-mtbs/\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale Moterra</a>).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike has a genuinely unique silhouette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pole Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>The unique-looking linkage is called ‘Sensei’.</p>\n<p>It’s raised up to reduce chainslap and to keep the linkage away from the motor.</p>\n<p>The kinematic is designed for eMTBs. It has a progressive stroke, which can be used with either airo or coil shocks, while a falling rate of anti-squat keeps pedal kickback on bigger hits low.</p>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        \n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Pole has managed to keep the anti-squat figure at around 100% in all gears at the sag point, keeping the pedalling performance consistent, something which many <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">suspension design layouts</a> don’t achieve.</p>\n<p>In the dynamic area of suspension travel (around 30-60 per cent) the shock’s leverage ratio is held at around 2.6.</p>\n<p>The falling rate suspension is said to give good small bump sensitivity, mid-stroke support and smooth bottom-out resistance.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like Pole’s other bikes, the frameset is CNC machined from 7075-T6 aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pole Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>Pole says it has mounted the shock sideways to reduce stresses on the mounting hardware. Other frame features include internal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post cable</a> routing that doesn’t need motor removal, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-universal-derailleur-hanger/\">SRAM’s UDH mech hanger</a>, and a pair of bottle cage bosses.</p>\n<h2>Pole Voima geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is built around a BMW V10 battery, which is integrated into the down tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pole Bicycles</i></span></div>\n<p>Four frame sizes will be offered – K1 to K4. Looking at the K3 (which we’d equate to a large) gives the following key geometry figures.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Reach:</strong> 510mm</li>\n<li><strong>Head angle:</strong> 63.5 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube angle:</strong> 80 degrees</li>\n<li><strong>BB drop:</strong> 0mm</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelbase:</strong> 1,343mm</li>\n<li><strong>Chainstay length:</strong> 455mm</li>\n<li><strong>Seat tube length:</strong> 420mm</li>\n</ul><div></div>\n<h2>Pole Voima components</h2>\n<p>To start, the Voima will be frame only, with full builds appearing in early 2022. I</p>\n<p>n order to get hold of one, a €200 downpayment will ensure you get a build slot for the frame this autumn.</p>\n<p>The bike is priced with an introductory price of €5,490 (K2 and K3 sizes only), rising to €5,990. Though not available until 2022, introductory full build prices will be €8,490, rising to €8,990.</p>\n<p>The single build gets the following components.</p>\n<ul><li>RockShox Zeb Select 190mm fork</li>\n<li>RockShox Super Deluxe shock</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-gx-eagle-12-speed-drivetrain-review/\">SRAM GX Eagle</a> drivetrain</li>\n<li>SRAM Code R brakes</li>\n<li>Crank Brothers Synthesis E wheels</li>\n<li>Maxxis Assegai 29×2.5 WT tyres</li>\n<li>RaceFace finishing kit</li>\n<li>Crank Brothers dropper post</li>\n</ul>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0e47be327409217fcee3166c5a1f4cfcd0213e368aa55d662e8561cfb5d92ad2","category":"Cycling"}
