However, Prosser says his source has been \"very cryptic\" and that he assumes it's the upcoming ‌MacBook Air‌ powered by the M2 chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the information is true, the new colorful lineup of MacBooks would be a throwback to the older iBook G3. Apple first started to offer vibrant color options for its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, released in October, and the ‌iMac‌ followed suit last month. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has reported that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-macbook-air-mini-led-2020-launch/\">future model of the low-end portable Mac will feature a mini-LED display</a>; however, that shouldn't be in the near future. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/thinner-lighter-high-end-macbook-air-2021/\">working on a thinner and lighter MacBook Air</a> that could launch in the second half of 2021, however, Bloomberg has not reported that the new models will come in different colors.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/prosser-macbook-air-colors-similar-to-imac/\">Prosser: Next MacBook Air Could Come in Colors Similar to iMac</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prosser-next-macbook-air-could-come-in-colors-similar-to-imac.2295206/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qlzz9lZ7wwo:ibs1M85zEmw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qlzz9lZ7wwo:ibs1M85zEmw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Qlzz9lZ7wwo\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"345851afa3b6ea00075307d04cda957ed19436cd576da9371e8a08c5e4f24045","category":"Apple"}
