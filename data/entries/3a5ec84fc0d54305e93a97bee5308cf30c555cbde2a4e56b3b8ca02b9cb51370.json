If you don&rsquo;t have iCloud Photos enabled, the next easiest way to shift a movie you shot on your iPhone to your Mac is via AirDrop. However, some people have found the resulting video is of lower resolution or quality than the original on the iPhone. AirDrop isn&rsquo;t designed to reduce fidelity, so what&rsquo;s at work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The culprit appears to be <em>Settings &gt; Photos &gt; Transfer to Mac or PC</em> in iOS/iPadOS. If this option is set to Automatic instead of Keep Originals, the iPhone or iPad may opt to export the media to transfer to a Mac, particularly if the Mac is a release or two behind the current macOS version. Changing the option to Keep Originals always forces the actual stored video at its original size.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2464\" height=\"2285\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"iOS 14 video transfer options\" class=\"wp-image-100060904\" srcset=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg 2464w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg?resize=300,278 300w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg?resize=768,712 768w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg?resize=1024,950 1024w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg?resize=1536,1424 1536w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ios14-airdrop-video-transfer-options.jpg?resize=2048,1899 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2464px) 100vw, 2464px\"><figcaption><p>Set the preference for Photos to always transmit originals (left), or use instead or in addition Options settings when sharing to include all photo and video information.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also bypass that option in Photos, as well as send even more information along with an image or video:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>In Photos in iOS or iPadOS, tap the <em>Share</em> button.</li><li>Select one or more images.</li><li>Tap the <em>Options</em> link at the top of the view.</li><li>Enable <em>All Photos Data</em> below the Include label.
