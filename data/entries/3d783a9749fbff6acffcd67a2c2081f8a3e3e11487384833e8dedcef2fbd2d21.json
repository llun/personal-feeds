It was shot with a Sony A9ii and a Sony 24-70 f2.8 GM lens in the San Juan Basin, NM.</em></p>\n<p>“In the Four Corners, within the northwestern corner of New Mexico lies the San Juan Basin, which is home to various badlands. These formations were created through water deposition by various forms of water. Seas, rivers, and swamps deposited vegetation, organic matter, and minerals over the course of 550 million years. Through the combination of uplift and aeolian erosion (wind), these unique landscapes were slowly shaped over the last 2 million years.”</p>\n<p>For a high-res JPG, suitable for print and desktop wallpaper*, right-click and save link as – <a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/03/2021CalendarMar-scaled.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Radavist 2021 – March</a>.
