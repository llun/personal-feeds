As usual, WWDC saw the introduction of Apple's next-generation operating system versions for all of its major platforms, along with a number of developer-focused announcements, but there were no hardware announcements on this year's agenda.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Top-Stories-53-Feature2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to this week's preview of all of the upcoming software changes, we also saw the official launch of Spatial Audio and Lossless Audio on Apple Music, which offer the options of improved audio quality and a more immersive music experience.
