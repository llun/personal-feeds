Priced at &#36;70, the Legend Band is a slim, attractive black leather strap that has a bright blue interior accent and highlight stitching in black or colorful teal and pink variants.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/ampere-legend-band-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1710\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782202\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nMade from German leather, the Legend Band has been specially treated to make it water and sweat resistant so it can be comfortably worn all day long and for any activity. The leather will age over time and take on a unique patina that will be different for each wearer.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/ampere-legend-band-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782203\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Legend Band has a traditional buckle closure and the design matches any of the available Apple Watch colors. It is available in 42 or 44mm size options, so it will fit Apple's larger Apple Watches. It is compatible with all Apple Watch models, from the Series 1 to the Series 6 and SE.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/ampere-legend-band-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782204\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAlong with the Legend Band, the accessory bundle also includes the Unravel Apple Watch+ charger, which is a wireless charging station designed for Apple devices. It features two 10W wireless charging coils for Apple's iPhones and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, along with a built-in Apple Watch charging puck for the Apple Watch.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/ampere-unravel-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782205\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Unravel AW+ has a neat hinge design that lets it fold over itself so it's portable and ideal for travel.
