Here’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=world.hey.com&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live\">a simple search on Twitter</a> to see all the Hey World posts that have been tweeted so far.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone knows friction in software is harmful. But I think we all continually underestimate just how big an influence friction is on what people actually do and use. People don’t write long multi-tweet threads because it’s a good way to post a short essay, they do it because it’s so low friction. That’s what makes Hey World such a great idea. If you’re using Hey for email, there’s literally nothing you need to do to set it up.</p>\n\n<p>Can you edit your posts? Yep. Creating a new post is exactly like sending an email to the magic world@hey.com address, but once sent/posted, Hey treats such messages differently than regular emails. You can see all your Hey World posts in a list by themselves, accessed from a new item in the main Hey menu, and if you open a post, you can edit it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Hey World Blogging Goes Live’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/05/hey-world-goes-live\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"26b20100d4f675140bce86ff208020f81f333847386f9986c5986468ddf22b42","category":"Tech"}
