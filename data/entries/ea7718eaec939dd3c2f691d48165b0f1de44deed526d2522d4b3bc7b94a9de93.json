Which is equivalent to 82 chocolate smarties stacked on each other. I also am able to eat all the smarties.</p>— Conor Dunne (@conordunnealot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conordunnealot/status/501841383377084417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 19, 2014</a></blockquote><p>Dunne started his career at An Post Chain Reaction and also spent a year with JLT Condor, before getting his Grand Tour chance with Aqua Blue Sport and the Israel Cycling Academy. He ended his career after the 2019 season, after being unable to find a team for the new year.</p>\n<p>At An Post, bike sponsors Vitus <a href=\"http://vitusbikes.com/news/a-dunne-deal-vitus-create-bike-for-uci-s-tallest-rider/\" target=\"_blank\">had to create a new XXL 62cm (yes, sixty-two!) frame size</a> to accommodate Dunne, with a longer top tube allowing extra reach.</p>\n<h3>Guillermo Brunetta, 2.04m</h3>\n<p>Dunne isn’t the only 6ft 8in giant to have enjoyed a career on two wheels.</p>\n<p>While it seems no pro rider has ever been taller, Guillermo Brunetta is the same height as Irishman at 2.04m.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Guillermo Brunetta matches Dunne at 2.04m.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/argentine-cyclist-guillermo-brunetta-competes-in-the-4-000-news-photo/1157406651\"><strong>Martin Bernetti / Getty</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>Brunetta was not just tall, he also weighed in at 97kg – a product of his track-cycling upbringing.</p>\n<p>Brunetta’s career was spent in South America in the 2000s, where his powerful frame was put to good effect in winning four Argentinean national time-trial titles.</p>\n<h2>Keeping record</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Conor Dunne (2.04 m) y Samuel Dumoulin (1.59 m).

The answer relates to equipment regulations and the reach allowed on aero extension bars.</p>\n<p>Since tightening up on regulations (outlawing the Superman position developed by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/the-bikeradar-meets-podcast-graeme-obree/\" target=\"_blank\">Graeme Obree</a>), the horizontal distance between the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">bottom bracket</a> and the tips of the extension bars must be no more than 75cm for most riders. Those riders over 1.90m get extra scope – theirs can be 85cm.</p>\n<p>That’s not necessarily enough for all, however. Dunne appealed – to no avail – for even more leeway earlier in his career, arguing his aero position still saw his knees hit his handlebars.</p>\n<h2>Does height matter?</h2>\n<p>In short, yes, height does matter for professional cycling… sort of.</p>\n<p>ProCyclingStats’ <a href=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/articles/who-is-the-tallest-shortest-lightest-or-heaviest\" target=\"_blank\">2017 study</a> found the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">top time-triallists</a> were, on average, taller than the average WorldTour pro.</p>\n<p>At the opposite end of the scale, climbers were much shorter; the top climbers were, on average, 1.6cm shorter than the top sprinters and 2.7cm shorter than the average WorldTour pro.</p>\n<p>There will always be exceptions to the rule, however. Chris Froome, for example, is 1.86m (6ft 1in) – much taller than most of his Grand Tour rivals.</p>\n<p>However, the key factor is not height, but power – and, for climbing, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-to-weight-ratio/\" target=\"_blank\">power-to-weight ratio</a>.</p>","author":"Colin Henrys","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ea7718eaec939dd3c2f691d48165b0f1de44deed526d2522d4b3bc7b94a9de93","category":"Cycling"}
