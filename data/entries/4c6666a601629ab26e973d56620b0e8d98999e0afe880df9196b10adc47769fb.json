The world may have moved on to sleeker, less bulky technology since Nintendo's first portable landed in shopping malls and mom-and-pop electronics stores back in 1989. But a number of developers are returning to the green hue of Nintendo's flagship handheld to explore new ideas for the platform, using the classics as a template.</p>\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/pokemon/\"><em>Pokémon</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/zelda/\"><em>Zelda</em></a> are obvious, really surface level,\" Izma, creator of new Game Boy game <a href=\"https://izma.itch.io/deadeus\"><em>Deadeus</em></a>, says of his inspirations. \"But then there's some that I would say are a little deeper. <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/335670/LISA_The_Painful/\"><em>Lisa: The Painful</em></a>, the vibe and tone of that game heavily influenced [<em>Deadeus</em>].
