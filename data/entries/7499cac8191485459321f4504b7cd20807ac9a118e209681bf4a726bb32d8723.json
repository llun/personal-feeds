The first two letters now designate the cleat interface (RK for Keo, RS for SPD-SL, and XC for SPD), and the following numbers indicate whether the pedals offer dual-sided or single-sided power measurement (100 for single-sided, 200 for dual-sided).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505644\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>SPD-compatible power meter pedals will likely appeal more to the gravel crowd rather than trail riders given the prevalence of rock-induced pedal damage when riding off-road. But that&#8217;s not to say these won&#8217;t make their way on to plenty of XC race bikes, too.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on posted images from an unnamed consumer who was apparently able to buy a set in error from a brick-and-mortar retailer, the Rally XC model features an aluminum body with steel retention hardware, adjustable release tension, and (hopefully) replaceable stainless steel wear plates on the body. Garmin is also sticking to replaceable coin-cell batteries instead of a rechargeable setup, seemingly using the same size as the current Vector 3 road pedals, but with a metal cap that should hold up better than the Vector’s plastic one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stack height looks to be quite tall, however, especially as compared to Shimano’s latest XTR model — an unfortunately consequence of packing all of the necessary hardware into such a confined space. But on the plus side, Garmin looks to have provided some extra length to the pedal threads for riders who might want to run a couple of extra spindle washers for a wider stance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505647\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-3.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The coin cell battery is tucked away underneath this metal cap. Also clearly visible in this image is the pedal&#8217;s relatively tall stack height and the use of separate steel wear plates on the aluminum body.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the unnamed buyer, the retail price for the dual-sided version was US$1,200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the Shimano SPD-SL0-compatible Rally RS200, all we have to go on at the moment is a picture of the box, which suggests an identical stainless steel spindle assembly, a carbon composite body, and replaceable stainless steel wear plates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6-1340x702.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505698\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6-1340x702.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6-650x341.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6-190x100.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6-1080x566.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6-16x8.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garmin-Rally-XC-power-meter-pedals-6.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>We don&#8217;t have images of the actual pedals just yet, but the Shimano SPD-SL-compatible version is just as real as the SPD ones.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We otherwise don’t yet have any official communication on these from Garmin currently, so we’re also missing key details such as weight, claimed battery life and accuracy, retail pricing, availability, and Garmin’s arrangement — if any — with Shimano to allow a third-party user of its tightly controlled SPD-SL road system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, even this bare-boned information should be more than enough to whet plenty of appetites.
