However, there are plenty of flags</p>\n<div>\n      <p> Remember the <a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d’Italia</a> last year when everyone went ducking mental at <a href=\"/tags/ef-education-nippo\">Education First</a>, Rapha and Palace skateboards for collaborating on a special jersey that had a few ducks on it?</p>\n<p>The UCI was apoplectic that a team had the audacity to do something a little different and so came down hard on them with fines, failing to see the upside of kids who had never even heard of Jonathan Calceido or the Madonna di Campiglio suddenly snatching up anoraks and cycling shorts at retail price with the sole purpose of selling them on at twice their value to a fellow hype beast.</p>\n<p>It was quite the controversy, or ‘disruption’ as <a href=\"/tags/rapha\">Rapha</a> expertly branded it.</p>\n<p>Well, ducikly, this year’s jersey switch-out is a little less quackers because instead of aquatic birds, creepy faces and skateboards, Rapha and EF Education Nippo have collaborated on a more poignant message than ‘disruption by duck’ with the ‘Euphoria’ collection.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/05/dsc04979.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>No relation to Loreen’s iconic Eurovision-conquering anthem from 2012, Rapha describes the collection as a ‘kaleidoscopic creation, designed to celebrate people from different backgrounds and nations coming together in pursuit of a common goal’.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race plus daily photo galleries</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nHow have they done this? Well, by designing a vexillologist's dream: a rather lovely jersey with flags on it!</p>\n<p>The American team have swapped out their usual pink – to avoid a colour clash with the <em>maglia rosa</em> of the race leader – for a black jersey base emblazoned with a series of abstract flags with definite nods to Japan, Brazil, Bangladesh and Bulgaria all visible.</p>\n<p>It’s simple, it’s classy, it’s effective. And ironically, it’s not even the most ‘out there’ jersey at this year’s Giro. That award goes to the Israel Start-Up Nation posse and their ‘I’ve spilt red Fantini wine on the sofa’ tie-dye look.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/05/e0sfuu1xeaafs3c.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Obviously, <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha will be selling this new ‘Euphoria’ collection from its stores and online</a> in due course, however we expect it not to be as popular as last year’s range so no rush. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9580/ef-education-nippo-giro-ditalia-kit\">EF Education-Nippo Giro d'Italia kit</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>6 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9580%2Fef-education-nippo-giro-ditalia-kit\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=EF%20Education-Nippo%20Giro%20d%27Italia%20kit%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9580%2Fef-education-nippo-giro-ditalia-kit\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=EF%20Education-Nippo%20Giro%20d%27Italia%20kit%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9580%2Fef-education-nippo-giro-ditalia-kit\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=EF%20Education-Nippo%20Giro%20d%27Italia%20kit&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9580%2Fef-education-nippo-giro-ditalia-kit\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9580/ef-education-nippo-giro-ditalia-kit#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 6</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/dsc04945.jpg?itok=-XhRgrBk\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7b75a2e986c41973475e3d1b355b19fa5a492f5749db6f26c027c7575e6977da","category":"Cycling"}
