Bad weather saw race organisers strip out the ascents of the Passo Fedaia and the Passo Pordoi, cutting the stage from 212km to 153km and losing almost 2,000m of vertical elevation.</p>\n<p>Not that it mattered. As the race hit the snowy slopes of the Passo Giau, <em>maglia rosa</em> Egan Bernal unleashed an attack that silenced any doubts as to whether he was the strongest rider in the race. By the finish in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Bernal had put a further 27 seconds into Damiano Caruso, 80 seconds into Hugh Carthy, 2 minutes 37 seconds into Simon Yates... and 24 minutes into Remco Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>Rolling into the finishing straight, Bernal had crushed his competition to such an extent he even had time to remove his rain jacket and cross the line resplendant in pink. Class.</p>\n<p>Sure, we couldn't watch the day's action on the television but at least we have these photos.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9664/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giroditalia2021-stage16-3.jpg?itok=ROxvlCs2\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>33</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9664/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery\">Giro d'Italia 2021 Stage 16 Gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>24 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9664%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2016%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9664%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2016%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9664%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2016%20Gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9664%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9664/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-16-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giroditalia2021-stage16-1.jpg?itok=uO75cLRr\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"583c882a2d8b8f8c627b624646cb191ffb5d1d43a64b7be0ced78ffff5489822","category":"Cycling"}
