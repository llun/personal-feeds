Huawei has also launched \"Huawei Card,\" featuring a very similar model to ‌Apple Card‌ with a physical and virtual card, cashback, and other perks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the increasing number of smart card options from major tech companies, it is likely that Oppo Card will seek to compete with cashback and software integrations, but little else is known about the  finance product at this early stage.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oppo/\">Oppo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-card-rumored-to-face-oppo-card-competitor/\">Apple Card Rumored to Face 'Oppo Card' Competitor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-rumored-to-face-oppo-card-competitor.2302913/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LTM1znNi62M:ydMxDhBSQBI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LTM1znNi62M:ydMxDhBSQBI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LTM1znNi62M\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5505d40740a8fcf544f50106192e6224fbe14e2bf1d55c26f60e3db2913bd486","category":"Apple"}
