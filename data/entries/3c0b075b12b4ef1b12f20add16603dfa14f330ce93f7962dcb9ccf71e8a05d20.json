{"title":"Vanilla JavaScript Code Snippets","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/vanilla-javascript-code-snippets/","date":1617618600000,"content":"<p>Every now and again we have to deal with legacy code, wading through dark and eerie sides of the code base, often with a vague, ambiguous and unsettling documentation — if any is provided at all. In such cases, <strong>refactoring</strong> the component seems inevitable.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps you need to manage dates and arrays, or manipulate DOM — there is just no need to add an external dependency for a simple task of that kind, but we need to figure out the <em>best</em> way to do that. It’s always a good idea to explore <strong>lightweight vanilla JavaScript snippets</strong> as well — preferably the ones that don’t have any third-party dependencies. Fortunately, there is no shortage in tooling to do just that.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n\n<h4>More Useful Tools:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-auditing-tools/\">CSS Auditing Tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-generators/\">CSS Generators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/svg-generators/\">SVG Generators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/complete-guide-accessible-front-end-components/\">Accessible Front-End Components</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/useful-chrome-firefox-devtools-tips-shortcuts/\">Useful DevTools Tips and Shortcuts</a></li>\n<li>Also, <a href=\"/the-smashing-newsletter/\">subscribe to our newsletter</a> to not miss the next ones.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3>30 Seconds Of Code</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.30secondsofcode.org/\">30 Seconds of Code</a> features a <strong>huge repository of short code snippets</strong> for JavaScript, including helpers for dealing with primitives, arrays and objects, as well as algorithms, DOM manipulation functions and Node.js utilities.

You can also get all <a href=\"https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30\">30 days challenges and solutions</a> as a GitHub repo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/32ecd1ba-4462-4b5b-8d26-2422da9e648d/6-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://coursesfree.org/course/vanilla-javascript/\">Vanilla JavaScript video crash course</a> is another <strong>free video course</strong> with 43 sessions, starting out with JavaScript DOM all the way to async JS, Babel and Webpack and a JavaScript password generator.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b9090bf2-1244-46d1-9262-b28b7b98b171/7-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Migrating from jQuery to Vanilla JavaScript</h3>\n<p>If you still find yourself in the land of legacy systems running on jQuery, there is a number of resources that allow you to slowly move away from jQuery with more lightweight and standardized options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://plainjs.com/\">PlainJS</a>, <a href=\"http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/\">You Might Not Need jQuery</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/nefe/You-Dont-Need-jQuery\">You Don’t Need jQuery</a> are great references for vanilla JavaScript snippets. The sites feature repositories of code snippets for everything from UI and inputs to media, navigation and visual effects (with use cases <strong>not just for jQuery</strong>, but pretty much any legacy code).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/snipcart/learn-vanilla-js\">Learn Vanilla JS</a> features books, courses, <strong>evergreen resources</strong>, communities, podcasts all around vanilla JS. A fantastic repository that’s worth keeping close.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sebastiandedeyne.com/javascript-framework-diet/\">JavaScript Framework Diet</a> is Sebastian De Deyne’s <strong>ongoing series</strong> on common tasks, solved without JavaScript frameworks. You’ll learn about selecting element, event delegation, file structure, dropdowns and enter and leave transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Natively Format JavaScript Dates And Times</h3>\n<p>Do we still need libraries like Moment.js or date-fns to format JavaScript dates and times? With native browser capabilities being quite good these days and browser support being great, too, not necessarily, as Elijah Manor points out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/90b4d4e6-6dd1-4a5e-a986-d9f4ced3fbfb/8-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<p>Elijah summarized <a href=\"https://elijahmanor.com/blog/format-js-dates-and-times\">three different methods for dealing with time and dates</a>. The <code>toLocaleDateString</code> method comes in handy when you want a date that contains only numbers, a long wordy date, or one that outputs in a different language. If you only need to output the time portion of a JavaScript date object, there’s <code>toLocaleTimeString</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the generic method <code>toLocaleString</code> lets you pass one or all of the options from the former ones into one method. Elijah built a <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/musing-cherry-tufr3?expanddevtools=1&amp;fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;theme=dark\">CodeSandbox playground</a> where you can experiment with the different approaches.</p>\n<h3><code>this</code> vs. <code>that</code></h3>\n\n<p>The deep knowledge of a subject really lies in understanding subtle differences between alternate ways of solving the same problem. How is <code>nodeName</code> different from <code>tagName</code>? How are the two increment operators different, e.g. <code>++value</code> and <code>value++</code>? <a href=\"https://thisthat.dev/\"><code>this</code> vs. <code>that</code></a> is a friendly reference site for sorting out just this kind of questions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6860ef2e-d33c-4b50-8f7b-92ecc626b314/9-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<p>The growing little repository by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nghuuphuoc\">Phuoc Nguyen</a> <strong>explains differences between properties and functions</strong> for JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as DOM, HTML and CSS. Also, <a href=\"https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs\">WTF.js</a> is a growing repository of common headaches, gotchas and unexpected behaviors around JavaScript.</p>\n<h3>Writing Clean, Reusable Code</h3>\n<p>No one likes to deal with badly written code, but in reality it happens all too often. To help us do better, Ryan McDermott adapted the software engineering principles from Robert C. Martin’s book <em>Clean Code</em> for JavaScript. The result is a <a href=\"https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript\">practical guide</a> to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/09f877bc-794a-416f-9eb8-5dd968234804/10-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<p>From making variables meaningful and explanatory to limiting the amount of functions and dealing with error handling, the guide <strong>compares good and bad code examples</strong>. Of course, not every principle has to be strictly followed, but the guidelines help you assess the quality of the JavaScript code you and your team produce.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript The Right Way</h3>\n<p>Learning a new language can be quite a challenge, especially when there are so many tools and frameworks out there to get the most out of it as there are in the case of JavaScript. To prevent you from getting lost in all the possibilities and help you learn the <strong>best practices from the ground up</strong> instead, William Oliveira and Allan Esquina put together the guide “<a href=\"https://jstherightway.org/\">JavaScript The Right Way</a>”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01643cfe-b840-4dc3-80d4-a39a67f330b0/11-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<p>Aimed at both <strong>beginners and experienced developers</strong> who want to dive deeper into JavaScript best practices, the guide gathers articles, tips, and tricks from top developers, covering everything from the very basics to code style, tools, frameworks, game engines, reading resources, screencasts, and much more to make a developer’s life easier. The guide is available in eight languages. A gold mine full of JavaScript wisdom.</p>\n<p>And if you need another deep dive into JavaScript, Kyle Simpson's <a href=\"https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS\">You Don't Know JS</a> is always a good starting point (Kyle is working on the second edition at the moment, and also has plenty of books and video courses to explore).</p>\n<h3>Picking The Right JavaScript Framework</h3>\n<p>There are plenty of options when choosing a new JavaScript framework. But do you need one? And if so, how do you pick the right one? Sacha Greif’s <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-12-things-you-need-to-consider-when-evaluating-any-new-javascript-library-3908c4ed3f49/\">12-Points-Checklist</a> highlights <strong>12 things to keep in mind</strong> when evaluating any new JavaScript library. Most notably, features, performance, learning curve, compatibility and track record.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a15c2952-f3e0-47ed-a30b-adc9610d4295/12-vanilla-javascript-code-snippets.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://perf-track.web.app/\">Perf-Track</a> tracks <strong>framework performance at scale</strong>. It basically tracks the performance in terms of Core Web Vitals for Angular, React, Vue, Polymer, Preact, Ember, Svelte and AMP — on mobile and on desktop. The data set is currently still from 2020, but it gives us some insights into how well sites with these frameworks perform in the wild. For example, React with Gatsby perform better than the ones created with Create React app.</p>\n<p>Tim Kadlec also <a href=\"https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/\">conducted some research</a> around that, comparing <strong>jQuery, Vue.js, Angular and React</strong>. The end result: the current crop of frameworks isn’t doing enough to prioritize less powerful devices and help to close the gap between desktop and mobile. These figures might give you at least some context to make a more informed decision.</p>\n<h3>Standalone Vanilla JS Libraries</h3>\n<p>The libraries below are tiny, vanilla JavaScript libraries without any dependencies. Just as they are lightweight, sometimes you might need to make some adjustments, e.g. to provide announcements to screen readers, or support legacy browsers.
