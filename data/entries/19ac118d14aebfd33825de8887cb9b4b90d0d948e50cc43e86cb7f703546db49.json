The British automaker has a new global strategy, as revealed earlier on Monday by new CEO Thierry Bolloré. There's a new roadmap for Jaguar, which will lose its internal combustion engines as it focuses on purely electric luxury cars. Six new battery EVs are in the works for Land Rover, and the company is exploring hydrogen fuel cells as well.</p>\n<p>\"Jaguar Land Rover is unique in the global automotive industry,\" said Bolloré. \"Designers of peerless models, an unrivaled understanding of the future luxury needs of its customers, emotionally rich brand equity, a spirit of Britishness and unrivaled access to leading global players in technology and sustainability within the wider Tata Group. We are harnessing those ingredients today to reimagine the business, the two brands and the customer experience of tomorrow. The Reimagine strategy allows us to enhance and celebrate that uniqueness like never before. Together, we can design an even more sustainable and positive impact on the world around us.\"</p>\n<p>Under the Reimagine strategy, Bolloré said that JLR will become a \"battery first business.\" For Land Rover, there are six new BEVs scheduled to arrive by 2026, although the first of these isn't due until 2024. Future Land Rovers will be built using a pair of new flexible vehicle architectures—Modular Longitudinal Architecture and Electric Modular Architecture—both of which are powertrain-agnostic. And production for MLA vehicles will take place at Solihull in the British midlands.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742340#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742340&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
