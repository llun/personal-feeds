It’s no more real than the interfaces Tony Stark uses in the <em>Iron Man</em> movies.</p>\n\n<p>Me, back in 2011, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/27/microsoft-future\">regarding a concept design video from Microsoft</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This video encapsulates everything wrong with Microsoft. Their\ncoolest products are imaginary futuristic bullshit. Guess what,\nwe’ve all seen <em>Minority Report</em> already. Imagine if they\ninstead spent the effort that went into this movie on making\nsomething, you know, real, that you could actually go out and\nbuy and use today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos\">And in a follow-up</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’m not arguing that making concept videos directly leads to a\nlack of traction in the current market. I’m arguing that making\nconcept videos is a sign of a company that has a lack of\ninstitutional focus on the present and near-present. Can you\nimagine a sports team in the midst of a present-day losing season\nthat makes a video imagining a future championship 10 years out?</p>\n\n<p>The designs in these concept videos are free from real-world\nconstraints — technical, logical, fiscal. Dealing with\nconstraints is what real design is all about. Institutional\nattention on the present day — on getting innovative\nindustry-leading products out the door and creating consumer\ndemand for them — requires relentless company-wide focus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Facebook ‘Reality’ Labs’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/22/facebook-reality-labs\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"be488cce1cdcd1e89a709b0ad6fbde4981daa2f7fb96a8b7572c61a97bde8663","category":"Tech"}
