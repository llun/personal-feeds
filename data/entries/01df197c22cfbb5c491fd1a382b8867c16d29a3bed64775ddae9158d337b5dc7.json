Come June, all code relating to FTP will be removed altogether with the release of Firefox 90.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"Most places where an extension may pass 'ftp' such as filters for proxy or webRequest should not result in an error, but the APIs will no longer handle requests of those types,\" wrote Mozilla add-ons manager Caitlin Neiman in a <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2021/04/15/built-in-ftp-implementation-to-be-removed-in-firefox-90/\">blog post</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"To help offset this removal, ftp has been added to the list of supported protocol_handlers for browser extensions. This means that extensions will be able to prompt users to launch a FTP application to handle certain links.\"</blockquote>When Firefox 90 is released, users will need a dedicated FTP browser to access remote servers in the future. Google removed FTP support with the release of Chrome 88 in January.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mozilla/\">Mozilla</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/firefox/\">Firefox</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/firefox-88-to-disable-ftp-protocol/\">Firefox 88 to Disable FTP Next Week With Full Removal Set for June</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/firefox-88-to-disable-ftp-next-week-with-full-removal-set-for-june.2291888/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wuqWWe50D50:u5RAKKvi1hQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wuqWWe50D50:u5RAKKvi1hQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wuqWWe50D50\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01df197c22cfbb5c491fd1a382b8867c16d29a3bed64775ddae9158d337b5dc7","category":"Apple"}
