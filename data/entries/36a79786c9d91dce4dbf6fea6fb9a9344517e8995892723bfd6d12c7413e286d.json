[credit:\n                        YouTube/Disney+                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>For all its touted meta-elements celebrating different TV decades, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision\"><em>WandaVision</em></a> wrapped up its nine-episode run in classic Marvel fashion, with Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda and Paul Bettany's Vision valiantly defending their suburban nuclear family from the nefarious forces lined up against them. It was a satisfying, quite moving finale to this imaginative series. But fans expecting a surprise big-name cameo—Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange was a favorite of the pre-finale rumor mill—were disappointed.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below; major reveals for finale below the gallery. We'll give you a heads up when we get there,)</strong></p>\n<p>Frankly, I <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/everyone-loves-the-new-couple-on-the-block-in-first-wandavision-trailer/\">was skeptical</a> of the <em>WandaVision</em> concept when the studio <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/ewan-mcgregor-confirms-he-will-return-as-obi-wan-for-new-star-wars-series/\">offered a brief sneak peek</a> during D23 Expo 2019, Disney's annual fan extravaganza. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige—a fan of classic sitcoms—envisioned the series as a love letter to the golden age of television, with each episode channeling a sitcom style from a particular decade. Head writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jac_Schaeffer\">Jac Schaeffer</a> (<em>Captain Marvel, Black Widow</em>) championed the concept from the start, despite a brief backlash against the perceived silliness of the title. Schaeffer thought viewers would change their minds once they actually saw the series, and she was right: <em>WandaVision</em> currently boasts a 92 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It even won over my skeptical soul.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747396#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747396&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36a79786c9d91dce4dbf6fea6fb9a9344517e8995892723bfd6d12c7413e286d","category":"Tech"}
