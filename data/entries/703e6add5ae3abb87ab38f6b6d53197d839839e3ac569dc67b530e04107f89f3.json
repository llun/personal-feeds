Here is to the step back and rebound. Here is to the cold beers at the end and the diners that taste better.<br />\nComing home was the hardest part.<span></span></p>\n<p>There are three new ultra-distance cycling challenges organized in Portugal, the N2 which always existed and is regarded as a small route 66 traversing the country vertically, about 730 km, the N222 often described as the most beautiful road of Portugal, Europe, and maybe even the world, 230 km, and the less famous N230 going from the seaside towards the highest mountains of the country. </p>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>It is a 210 km ride accumulating 3700 meters of elevation, it is not that hard but it has to be completed in one ride and it is a fairly long ride. These are completely free events, you register and you get on your bike, you record your progress, and voilà! This is a new kind of event that we see more and more as Covid regulations still make races impossible in most parts of the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/TRAIN-SHOT-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Samuel Beckett once wrote, “Fail, fail again, fail better.”</em></p>\n<p>I don’t know if he had an imposter syndrome or just massive respect for his craft.<br />\nBut it resonated with me when I was studying film.<br />\nAnd it makes even more sense to my cyclist self!<br />\nTake the pressure off,<br />\n“failing was never an option” is for the KOM hunters, the epic riders on a dry Sunday who wax their legs and treat their beards.<br />\nFailing should always be an option,<br />\nor you’ll stay on the couch,<br />\nthe first time you tried walking,<br />\nmost likely, you failed and fell,<br />\nwalking is taking a lunge and catching yourself up,<br />\nif failing was no option, you would be crawling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Blank-Billboard-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Failing is ok when all you wanna do is learn, get better, come back, up to great and navigate through unknown situations that you haven’t encountered a million times before</p>\n<p>The country (Portugal) started reopening, so did my rides, going a bit further every time, I have a hard time with loops, I like the A to B more than the A to A. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/BIRDS-SHOT-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Little by little and in a very organic way this “project” became bigger in my life and am very lucky to be able to count on the help of some friends in the business who decided to support my failing attempts at little challenges!<br />\nIf I had to make a point, if I was to have a message, it would have to be the answer to this precious question:  “Daddy how can I always stay a kid?”</p>\n<p>“Well I think you oughta do only the things that give you kicks of joy or a sense of purpose but mostly joy, it’s a purpose in itself.

At the end we go back to dust.
