{"title":"Sports Tech Huge Amazon Prime Day Roundup & Tracker!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/06/sports-tech-huge-amazon-prime-day-roundup-tracker.html","date":1624263604000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>In the unlikely event the internet or Amazon hasn’t already informed you, today and tomorrow (Monday/Tuesday) is Amazon Prime Day. That means that most (all? Update: Not All, Not Canada) Amazon country properties are doing pretty substantial deals across the board on all sorts products, including yes, sports tech gear. Historically held in July, this year it’s a bit earlier, and historically, Amazon Prime Day has been *VERY* strong for sports tech deals – even eclipsing Black Friday (from an Amazon perspective).</p>\n<p>In some ways, for sports tech items it’s timed perfectly. See, typically Black Friday deals are for ‘older’ things, rarely the ‘just announced’ stuff that often comes in the late August to October timeframe (especially cycling trainers, and watches). But with Prime Day being in June, there’s frankly not a lot of ‘just announced’ stuff. Thus, more opportunity for brands to put things on sale for a one-off summer day.</p>\n<p>To take advantage of Amazon Prime Days you simply need to be an Amazon Prime member. The good news is that you can sign-up with the free trial and cancel later if you don’t find value in it. Just hit up this giant banner below to do so:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I’ve organized all the best sports technology Amazon Prime Days deals (and a few others I’ve found) below in the tables by category. I’ll be updating them throughout the next two days. <strong>Keep in mind not all deals last</strong> (in fact, most don’t). So if you see something that’s hot, I’d strongly suggest buy now (and return later if need be).</p>\n<p>With that, onto the deals! And thanks for supporting the site via the links below.

Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Europe Folks Note: This year almost *ALL* of the watch/cycling deals you’ll see in the main lists are available in Europe too! So you can click on those links and it’ll redirect to the correct Europe store. For the most part, the %-off are the same (a first!). I’m also adding in Europe-only/unique deals to the bottom Europe section too.</strong></p>\n<h3><span>Watches &amp; Wearables:</span></h3>\n<p>This covers anything you can wear that’s watch-like or activity band-like, including sensors.  Generally speaking, you’ll mostly find deals here that are on things I’ve written about in the past.  So you won’t find a deal on some random non-sports tech watch here, or on socks.  Unless the socks have some crazy sensor or something in them.</p>\n<table>\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th></th><th><span>Product</span></th><th><span>Sale Price</span></th><th><span>Amazon</span></th><th><span>Other site</span></th><th><span>Sale Notes</span></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=17c96bdf8da524c531b135fb002d1d4d&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2019/11/Apple-AirpodsPro-TransparentV2-125x125.png\" /></a></td><td>Apple AirPods Pro - $60 off!<br /><small>$249</small></td><td>$189</td><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=17c96bdf8da524c531b135fb002d1d4d&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></td><td></td><td></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1N9023PDKOS7I&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=airpods+wireless+charging+case&amp;qid=1602697840&amp;sprefix=airpods+wi,aps,258&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySFpWQlpRV1cxVE1WJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTYzMTE1M05KWTU2NEtaQkFZJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0MjE0MzMzUDg3QUMyWDMyUVdTJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=11acbfac920416f7a38e4bb9505e1419&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2020/10/Apple-Airpods-TransparentV2-95x125.png\" /></a></td><td>Apple AirPods with Wireless Charging Case - $50 Off!</td><td>$149</td><td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=1N9023PDKOS7I&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=airpods+wireless+charging+case&amp;qid=1602697840&amp;sprefix=airpods+wi,aps,258&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySFpWQlpRV1cxVE1WJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTYzMTE1M05KWTU2NEtaQkFZJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0MjE0MzMzUDg3QUMyWDMyUVdTJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=11acbfac920416f7a38e4bb9505e1419&amp;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></td><td></td><td>⚡ I use AirPods primarily when I'm travelling just to listen in airports, planes, etc...
