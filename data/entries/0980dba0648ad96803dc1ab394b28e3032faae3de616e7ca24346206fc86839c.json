{"title":"iPad Pro 'Center Stage' Camera Feature Will Support Third-Party Apps","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/ipad-pro-center-stage-camera-third-party-apps/","date":1618992979000,"content":"Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-ipad-pro-with-m1-chip/\">newly announced M1 iPad Pro models</a> boast a new video calling feature called <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/m1-ipad-pro-center-stage-selfie-camera/\">Center Stage</a>, which uses machine learning to automatically pan and zoom the front-facing camera to keep you center in the frame as you move around. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/ipad-pro-center-stage.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple envisages Center Stage being used for video calls that involve things like whiteboarding with coworkers or attending a virtual family gathering. Presumably the feature will also correct the problem of a user not appearing centered in the shot when the iPad is in landscape orientation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDuring its announcement, Apple didn't explain whether it would be exclusive to FaceTime calls, but according to iOS developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1384584226050387970?s=20\">Federico Viticci</a>, third-party apps will be able to use Center Stage via an API framework, which could mean we'll one day see the feature enabled on Teams and Zoom calls.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Center Stage, the new iPad Pro feature that uses the front-facing camera to automatically follow the user during video calls, is *not* exclusive to FaceTime. Third-party apps can use Center Stage and there'll be an API available to toggle it on/off. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AppleEvent</a></p>— Federico Viticci (@viticci) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1384584226050387970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nCenter Stage is made possible on the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro thanks to the new chipset and an improved TrueDepth camera system, which includes a a 12MP Ultra Wide front-facing camera with a 120° field of view, compared to the standard 7MP wide-angle front-facing camera on the previous generation models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor that reason, it's unlikely that Center Stage will come to older iPads. The new 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $799, while the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,099. Pre-orders begin April 30, with availability beginning in the second half of May. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/ipad-pro-center-stage-camera-third-party-apps/\">iPad Pro 'Center Stage' Camera Feature Will Support Third-Party Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-center-stage-camera-feature-will-support-third-party-apps.2292538/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AVr8yyc0Qcc:k76zlk1Jr2A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AVr8yyc0Qcc:k76zlk1Jr2A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AVr8yyc0Qcc\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0980dba0648ad96803dc1ab394b28e3032faae3de616e7ca24346206fc86839c","category":"Apple"}
