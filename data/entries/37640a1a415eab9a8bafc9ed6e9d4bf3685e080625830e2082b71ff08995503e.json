The American got her first taste of pro racing at the Joe Martin Stage Race and Colorado Classic in 2019 and will join the European-based team for more race experience at the highest level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Working with this world-class organization is a dream come true,” said McGowan in a press statement. “I’m excited to spend more time with my teammates during team camp next month and training hard before setting race goals for August and beyond.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McGowan is an activist to get more diversity and inclusivity in women&#8217;s cycling. Her longstanding goal was to become the first African American woman at an elite level. She has years of American crit racing experience with her team <a href=\"https://www.aquickbrownfox.com/press\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">A Quick Brown Fox</a>. In 2019 she finished the Joe Martin Stage Race with the Amy D Foundation in 33rd place, the same year McGowan raced the Colorado Classic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McGowan participates in various initiatives to equalize cycling, one of those being her &#8216;Do Better Together&#8217; virtual ride series. Her dedication to become a professional racer is fueled by her desire for more women and young girls to see themselves represented at the highest levels of cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>McGowan discovered racing relatively late, compared to the World Tour riders she hopes to line up against. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 34-year old rider has been an ambassador for Liv bikes for a few years but will now enjoy the expertise and facilities of a World Tour set-up as she gets ready to join the team in Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As Ayesha works with our team resources, including ongoing training and monitoring, we look forward to investing in her development. We will aim to guide Ayesha as well as possible including equipment, training programmes and our knowledge and expertise. In this way, we hope to take her to the next level in her career, just as we have done with many other talents before. Together with Ayesha, we are excited to get started,&#8221; team manager Eric van den Boom said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Liv Racing team is the continuation of Team CCC-Liv. McGowan will join the 11-rider roster of Sofia Bertizzolo, Soraya Paladin, Valerie Demey, Lotte Kopecky, Alison Jackson, Marta Jaskulska,&nbsp;Jeanne Korevaar, Evy Kuijpers, Pauliena Rooijakkers, and Sabrina Stultiens. Per UCI rules, Liv Racing can officially employ trainees on the first of August. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/ayesha-mcgowan-on-her-way-to-womens-world-tour-with-liv-racing/\">Ayesha McGowan on her way to Women&#8217;s World Tour with Liv Racing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"José Been","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"37640a1a415eab9a8bafc9ed6e9d4bf3685e080625830e2082b71ff08995503e","category":"Cycling"}
