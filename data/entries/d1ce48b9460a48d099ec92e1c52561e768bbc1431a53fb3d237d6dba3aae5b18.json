{"title":"Women's WorldTour Calendar 2021: The Rouleur Racing Guide","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/worldtour-womens-calendar-2021-the-rouleur-racing-guide","date":1617187348000,"content":"\n      <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a late start due to the cancellation of the Australian races, the Women’s World Tour (WWT) season is well underway now, with four rounds already raced and another one on the way this Sunday. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, each WWT race has been won by a different rider from a different team; with Chantal van den Broek Blaak (SD Worx) outdoing Elisa Longo Borghini (Trek-Segafredo) to take Strade Bianche, Longo Borghini taking Trofeo Alfredo Binda in emphatic style, Grace Brown (BikeExchange) time trialling to a win and upsetting the sprinters at De Panne and a classic show of speed and style from Marianne Vos (Jumbo Visma) at Gent-Wevelgem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s dominant duo of Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx) and Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) were absent from the past three WWT races. We will see them both return on Sunday for Tour of Flanders, but will they be able to fend off an increasingly strong group of favourites throughout this season? </span></p>\n<br>\n<h4><strong>Races so far </strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strade Bianche 1. WWT (06/03)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trofeo Alfredo Binda 1.WWT  (21/03)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oxyclean Classic Brugge-De Panne 1.WWT (24/03)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gent-Wevelgem In Flanders Fields 1.WWT (28/03)</span></p>\n<br>\n<h4><strong>Flanders 1.WWT (04/04)</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tour of Flanders, or Ronde van Vlaanderen, is one of the longest-running women’s classics with the first edition held in 2004. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2020 Chantal van den Broek Blaak won the race solo and, since 2007, the race has not been won by the same rider more than once. The style of each win has been equally as varied, from solo breakaways to a small group and even a bunch sprint making this one of the most exciting and unpredictable races on the calendar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the route for this year’s race has not been made public, we can expect it to be around 150km, starting and finishing in Oudenaarde and incorporating some of the legendary cobbled climbs such as the Oude Kwaremont and the decisive Patterberg, the top of which comes with just 13km to the line. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Anna van der Breggen,Chantal van den Broek-Blaak, Annemiek van Vleuten, Elisa Longo Borghini</span></p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Emma Cecille Norsgaard, Sarah Roy, Demi Vollering, Lisa Brennauer, Grace Brown</p>\n<br>\n<h3><b>Paris Roubaix 1.WWT (11/04)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confirmation is yet to be given as to whether the inaugural Women’s Paris Roubaix will go ahead on the 11th April. After being cancelled in 2020 fans had the date marked in their calendars for the first women’s race on the hallowed cobbled roads of ‘The Hell of the North’ but after mixed announcements from French officials and the ASO there is still no official word on the fate of the race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the men, the race has been held since 1896 and has a long and feted history. The route released for the women’s race last October was a shorter, modified version which the start in Denain, just south of Roubaix. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 116km the route may appear truncated but the punishing terrain means there will be no shortage of a challenge for the peloton. The route for the women’s race incorporates 29.5km of cobbles including some of the hardest sectors such as the Carrefour de l'Arbre. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the women’s peloton do race over cobbles in other classics, those at Paris Roubaix are a different beast as many teams found out when they went to recon the course last year. Equipment and course knowledge will play a big part for whoever wants to make history by winning the first women’s edition of this iconic race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Chantal van den Broek-Blaak, Anna van der Breggen, Ellen van Dijk, Lucinda Brand, Marianne Vos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Lotte Kopecky, Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado, Lisa Brennauer, Amy Pieters.</span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/DSC00066_1024x1024.jpg?v=1617179834\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><em>Photo credit: Zac Williams/SWpix.com</em></p>\n<h3><b>Amstel Gold Race 1.WWT (18/04) </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On to the Ardennes. The first edition of the women’s Amstel Gold race was held in 2001, however there would only be a further two editions before the race was shelved with the organisers citing difficult logistics as the reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was in 2017— after a 14-year hiatus —that the revamped edition of the women’s Amstel Gold Race returned, with Anna van der Breggen taking the win. Due to the pandemic, the race was not held in 2020 and the 2021 version will be held on a closed, but no less challenging, 16.5km circuit featuring the Bemelerberg, Geulhemmerberg, and Cauberg with the women completing seven laps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Anna van der Breggen, Kasia Nieuwiadoma, Annemiek van Vleuten, Marianne Vos, Elisa Longo Borghini, Marianne Vos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Elisa Balsamo, Marta Cavall.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3><b>La Fleche Wallonne 1.WWT (21/04)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second Ardennes classic of the season is also one of the longest-established one-day races for women with the first edition held in 1998. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impressively, Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx) has won every edition since 2015 — can anyone challenge her on the Mur de Huy or will she take a seventh win?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Anna van der Breggen, Annemiek van Vleuten, Marianne Vos, Kasia Newiadoma, Ashleigh Moolman Pasio.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Demi Vollering, Mikayla Harvey.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3><b>Liège–Bastogne–Liège 1.WWT (25/04)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The finale of last year’s fourth edition of Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes was nail-bitingly close as Grace Brown (BikeExchange) tried to chase down Lizzie Deignan (Trek-Segafredo) who had been away solo. Deignan held the Australian off but final margin between Deignan and Brown was just nine seconds. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, as if it wasn’t hilly enough, the 141km race features a new climb: the Côte de Desnié in addition to the rest of the backloaded côtes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Lizzie Deignan, Anna van der Breggen, Marianne Vos, Annemiek van Vleuten, Kasia Niewiadoma. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Floortje Mackaij, Demi Vollering, Amanda Spratt.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3><b>Festival Elsy Jacobs 2.Pro (30/04-02/05)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only the second stage race of the season for the women but the start of a string of them throughout the month of May. Festival Elsy Jacobs might not be a World Tour race but it certainly attracts a World Tour crowd. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Held in Luxembourg where the eponymous first ever women’s UCI Road World Championship and former Hour record holder was from, the race has been run since 2008. Marianne Vos has been victorious on three occasions while Anna van der Breggen has won two editions. The race was not held in 2020 but the previous four editions have each been won by different riders.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Lisa Brennauer, Christine Majerus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Lizzy Banks, Lisa Klein.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3><b>Vuelta a Burgos Féminas 2.WWT (20/05-23/05)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New to the WWT for 2021, Vuelta a Burgos Feminas started out as a Spanish National Cup race before moving up to UCI status in 2019. The race comes off the back of a series of 1.1 races in the north west of Spain and the four stages look set to be for the climbers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Annemiek van Vleuten, Mavi Garcia, Ashleigh Moolman Pasio, Anna van der Breggen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Marta Cavalli, Ane Santesteban.</span></p>\n<strong>Internationale Lotto Thüringen Ladies Tour 1.Pro (25/05-30/05)</strong>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, not World Tour, but as the longest-running (and longest) women’s stage race on the calendar (held since 1986) the German race is worth a mention. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race, held in the German region of </span><span>Thuringia, was</span> upgraded to 2.Pro status in 2020 however due to the pandemic it was unable to run. Back again for 2021 and still with 2.Pro status, the six-day long race will be held in late may rather than its usual early June slot. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Lisa Brennauer, Lisa Klein, Ellen van Dijk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Kathrin Hammes, Liane Lippert.</span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20200829LCB2044-A.S.O.__Thomas_Maheux_1024x1024.jpg?v=1617179462\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><em>Photo credit: A.S.O./ Thomas Maheux/SWPix.com</em></p>\n<h3><b>La Course 1.WWT (27/06)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year’s La Course was one of the most exciting races of the season, with Lizzie Deignan beating Marianne Vos in a sprint to the line in Nice after team mate Elisa Longo Borghini set her up perfectly. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Course has a mixed pedigree, starting out as a circuit race around the Champs Elysees on the final day of the men’s Tour de France </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year’s edition will mark the longest in the event’s history at 130km and feature six ascents of the Mûr-de-Bretagne. It is also the last one-day event before the Olympics Road Race so expect the peloton to be sizing each other up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Lizzie Deignan, Marianne Vos, Anna van der Breggen, Annemiek van Vleuten, Kasia Niewiadoma, Elisa Longo Borghini, Cecille Uttrup Ludwig.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Évita Muzik, Marta Cavalli, Mavi Garcia, Soraya Palladin.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3>Giro Rosa Internazionale Femminile 2.Pro (02/07-11/07)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being demoted from WWT to 2.Pro this season when the organisers failed to supply live images of the race last year hasn’t deterred many high-profile riders from naming the Giro Rosa as a target race in 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that it’s so close to the Olympic it’s perhaps not a surprise that riders want to use the 10 day event as a tuneup before the big event. In true Giro Rosa style there is little to no information on the race as yet, other than it will be back up to the usual ten stages after being reduced to nine in 2020. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After crashing out of the race while leading the GC in 2020, Annemiek van Vleuten will likely be back with a vengeance to claim her third win overall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Annemiek van Vleuten, Anna van der Breggen, Kasia Niewiadoma, Ashleigh Moolman Pasio, Cecille Uttrup Ludwig.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Mikayla Harvey, Mavi Garcia, Soraya Palladin.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3>Donostia San Sebastián Klasikoa Women 1.WWT (31/07)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A first edition of Itzulia Basque Country for women was due to take the place of Donostia San Sebastián Klasikoa this season, however due to the pandemic it was unable to go ahead. Organisers instead decided to hold another Donostia San Sebastián Klasikoa Women in place of the stage race, which will kick off in 2022 instead. </span></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span>Donostia San Sebastián Klasikoa Women was itself a new race in 2019, and has only had one pro edition so far, won by Lucy Kennedy (Team BikeExchange). </span><br></span></p>\n<p>Favourites: Annemiek van Vleuten, Cecille Uttrup Ludwig, Lucy Kennedy</p>\n<p>Outsiders: Mavi Garcia, Janneke Ensing.</p>\n<h3>Postnord Vårgårda WestSweden TTT 1.WWT (07/08)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the World Championship TTT was taken off the calendar in 2018 this is one of the few</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span>—</span></span> if not the only<span>—</span> TTT outing in the season for the women. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its earlier iterations it was dominated by Specialized-Lululemon (now Canyon//SRAM) and latterly by Boels Dolmans (now SD Worx) however it was Trek-Segafredo who took the last win in 2019.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> SD Worx, Canyon//SRAM, Team BikeExchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Team DSM, Liv Racing, Ceratizit-WNT.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3>Postnord Vårgårda WestSweden RR 1.WWT (08/08)</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually an outing for the sprinters, the Swedish race was last won by Marta Bastianelli in 2019, however the inimitable Marianne Vos has taken the win three times in the race’s fourteen year history.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Emma Cecille Norsgaard, Chlow Hosking, Lotte Kopecky, Emilia Fahlin, Mariane Vos, Kirsten Wild, Elena Cecchini. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Letizia Paternoster, Arlenis Sierra, Lotta Henttala.</span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/SF210312-10178_1024x1024.jpg?v=1615819391\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>\n<h3><strong></strong></h3>\n<h3><strong>Ladies Tour of Norway 2.WWT (12/08-15/08)</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ladies Tour of Norway was due to collaborate with Danish and Swedish federations to organise a six-day ‘Battle of the North’ stage race across Norway, Denmark and Sweden last year. Unfortunately, the pandemic delayed the plans and </span><span>—</span> although the race is set to go ahead in 2022 <span>—</span> the Ladies Tour of Norway remains a standalone four-day stage race for 2021. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Established in 2014, the race is relatively new but has been ambitious from the beginning, quickly rising to World Tour status in 2017 since when Marianne Vos has won every edition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Marianne Vos, Lorena Wiebes, Emma Cecille Norsgaard, Marta Bastianelli, Amalie Dideriksen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Marta Cavalli, Lisa Klein, Coryn Rivera, Emilia Fahlin.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3><strong>Simac Ladies Tour 2.WWT (24/08-29/08)</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another stage race with a relatively long history relative to many women’s races, Boels Ladies Tour went by the name Holland Ladies Tour from when it was first held, in 1998, before changing names due to sponsorship, eventually becoming Boels Rentals Ladies Tour and now Simac Ladies Tour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent winner was Christine Majerus in 2019. The race usually comprises a mix of flat and hillier stages as well as an individual time trial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Christine Majerus, Lizzie Deignan, Annemiek van Vleuten, Lisa Brennauer, Anna van der Breggen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Marta Cavalli, Leah Thomas.</span></p>\n<h3><strong> GP de Plouay - Lorient- Agglomération Trophée CERATIZIT 1.WWT (31/08) </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One for the punchier riders who can make it over steep climbs, GP de Plouay favours riders like Lizzie Deignan and Marianne Vos who have won the race three times and twice between them. Although Anna van der Breggen has also taken the win at Plouay in a solo break.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Anna van der Breggen, Lizzie Deignan, Anna van der Breggen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outsiders: Amy Pieters, Grace Brown, </span>Lizzy Banks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ceratizit Challenge by la Vuelta 2.WWT (03/09-05/09) </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ceratizit Madrid Challenge is usually one of the last WWT races </span>of the season. Coinciding with the final stages of the Vuelta a España, the race — much like La Course before it —started life as a criterium around the streets of the city. In recent years, however, it has been upgraded to a three day stage race featuring a time trial, road stage and a circuit race. </p>\n<p>In a turn up for the sponsors, the past two editions have been won by Lisa Brennauer of Ceratizit-WNT.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Lisa Brennauer, Lorena Wiebes, Elisa Longo Borghini, Ellen van Dijk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Alice Barnes, Marta Cavalli, Elisa Balsamo.</span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: start;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW3_4174_1024x1024.jpg?v=1617179699\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>\n<p><em>Photo credit: Alex Whitehead/SWPix.com</em></p>\n<h3><strong>The Women’s Tour 2.WWT (04/10-09/10)  </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both a fan and rider favourite, the Women’s Tour has quickly taken the place of one of the best World Tour stage races on the women’s calendar. After being forced to cancel the 2020 event, the organisers announced that the race was postponed from its usual June spot to October for 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race often covers some of the most gruellingly tough parcours in the UK and although it doesn’t feature mountain passes, there is plenty of climbing. </span>For 2021 the race will feature a time trial for the first time in its history. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The race has also offered equal prize money since 2018, and as of this year will be showing the race live for the first time. The parcours for the 2021 race has yet to be released, but a mix of terrain can be expected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Marianne Vos, Anna van der Breggen, Lizzie Deignan, Kasia Niewiadoma, Cecille Uttrup Ludwig.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Ashleigh Moolman Pasio, Lizzy Banks, Josceline Lowden.</span></p>\n<br>\n<h3><strong>Tour of Chongming Island 2.WWT (14/10-17/10) </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the few races for pure sprinters on the WWT calendar, the Tour of Chongming Island has been held in Shanghai since 2007. The race’s palmares is a who’s who of women’s sprinting, with Chloe Hosking, Jolien d’Hoore, Lorena Wiebes, Ina-Yoko Teutenberg, and Kirsten Wild all having won the four-day stage race.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Chloe Hosking, Kirsten Wild, Emma Cecille Norsgaard, Jolien d'Hoore, Lorena Wiebes.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Outsiders: </strong>Letizia Paternoster, Arlenis Sierra, Lotta Henttala.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Tour of Guangxi 1.WWT (19/10) </h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the newest races on the WWT calendar, the Tour of Guangxi, like Chongming Island is one for the sprinters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guangxi is usually the final WWT race of the season, but with Ronde van Drenthe postponed this season it takes the penultimate slot, although it is unlikely to shake up the overall classification.</span></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There aren't too many chances throughout the season for them to really stretch their legs and go flat out for a finish and with some of the early-season sprint opportunities thwarted by breakaways they will be itching to launch the burners and round of the season in style.</span></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Chloe Hosking, Kirsten Wild, Emma Cecille Norsgaard, Jolien d'Hoore, Lorena Wiebes, Amalie Dideriksen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Lotte Kopecky, </span>Letizia Paternoster, Arlenis Sierra, Lotta Henttala.</p>\n<br>\n<h3><b>Ronde van Drenthe 1.WWT (23/10)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sprinters will want to make it back from China for another outing at Ronde van Drenthe just in case it comes down to a bunch kick. In the past few editions a reduced group has come to the line but it's a race that's been won by some of the fastest legs in the peloton including Jolien d'Hoore and former world champion Amalie Dideriksen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Favourites:</strong> Amalie Dideriksen, Lorena Wiebes, Chantal van den Broek-Blaak, Amy Pieters, Ellen van Dijk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Outsiders:</strong> Kisten Wild, Lisa Klein.</span></p>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"d1ce48b9460a48d099ec92e1c52561e768bbc1431a53fb3d237d6dba3aae5b18","category":"Cycling"}
