Songs will also automatically use Atmos when played on AirPods or Beats headphones that have Apple's H1 or W1 chips. Users will be able to manually enable Atmos on other headphones by tweaking the app's settings.</p>\n<p>Spatial audio will be limited to certain songs, but Apple says \"thousands of songs\" across numerous genres \"including hip-hop, country, Latin, pop, and classical\" will support it at launch, with more to come.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765499#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765499&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6435197b8b2ad135ce42d027b4554ecc6dc0ccbff3b3f82ca468617f5272c967","category":"Tech"}
