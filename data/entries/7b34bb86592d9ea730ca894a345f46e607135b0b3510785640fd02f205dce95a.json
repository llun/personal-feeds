{"title":"Readers’ Rides: Nick’s Self-Made Fat Front Fixed Gear","link":"https://theradavist.com/2021/02/readers-rides-nicks-self-made-fat-front-fixed-gear/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=readers-rides-nicks-self-made-fat-front-fixed-gear","date":1613143864000,"content":"<p>Readers&#8217; Rides aren&#8217;t meant to be all 26&#8243; wheeled basket bikes and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. Part of the joy we get from running this segment is the home-made, garage-cooked creations. Take this submission for example. Nick couldn&#8217;t fit on any production frames so he built his own frame. Then to up the ante, he put a fat fork on the front for some winter shenanigans&#8230; Read on below for more!<span id=\"more-205597\"></span></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s all Nick sent, along with a few photos:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I made this frame in my garage this fall because I’m too tall for bicycles. I made it to use track hubs because that’s what I have a lot of. It has been great on ice and compacted snow. I’m riding old familiar single track with fresh fear that’s really been really invigorating. Fat-front-fixed-gear is the hot new winter tracklocross as far as I am concerned.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br />\nNick&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-205598\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0108.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-205599\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-205600\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0101.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-205601\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0093.jpeg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
