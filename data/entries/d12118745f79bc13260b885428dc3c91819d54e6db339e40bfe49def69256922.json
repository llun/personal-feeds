{"title":"U.S. Calls for Pause on Johnson & Johnson Vaccine After One-in-a-Million Blood Clotting Cases","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/us/politics/johnson-johnson-vaccine-blood-clots-fda-cdc.html","date":1618325303000,"content":"\n<p>Noah Weiland, Sharon LaFraniere, and Carl Zimmer, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Federal health agencies on Tuesday called for an immediate pause\nin use of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose coronavirus vaccine\nafter six recipients in the United States developed a rare\ndisorder involving blood clots within about two weeks of\nvaccination.</p>\n\n<p>All six recipients were women between the ages of 18 and 48. One\nwoman died and a second woman in Nebraska has been hospitalized in\ncritical condition.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly seven million people in the United States have received\nJohnson &amp; Johnson shots so far, and roughly nine million more\ndoses have been shipped out to the states, according to data from\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After a run of remarkably good news on the COVID vaccination front here the U.S., this is an utter gut punch, and a horrendously wrong decision. This terrible decision is going to kill tens of thousands of Americans. Six blood clots after 7 million administered Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines, versus a disease that has a mortality rate of <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">nearly 1.8 percent in the U.S., and has killed 1.7 of every 1,000 people</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One in a million for these blood clots (which they don’t even know are attributable to the vaccine), versus 1.7 per thousand Americans already dead. Which doesn’t even include the millions of Americans who suffered or are suffering from cases that require hospitalization.</p>\n\n<p>This is criminal innumeracy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/jj-vaccine-paused\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d12118745f79bc13260b885428dc3c91819d54e6db339e40bfe49def69256922","category":"Tech"}
