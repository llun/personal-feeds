Coverage offered by the plans, as well as accidental damage fees, appear to remain unchanged.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/applecare-lower-prices.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the United States, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/S9750LL/A/applecare-for-macbook-air\">AppleCare+ for the MacBook Air</a> now costs $199, down from $249. The new price applies to both M1 and Intel-based MacBook Air models, although Apple no longer sells the Intel-based model directly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has split AppleCare+ into two separate plans for the M1 and Intel-based models, with <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/S9733LL/A/applecare-for-13-inch-macbook-pro-m1\">pricing for the M1 model lowered to $249</a>, down from $269. Notably, the price of AppleCare+ for the Intel-based 13-inch MacBook Pro <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/S9761LL/A/applecare-for-13-inch-macbook-pro-intel\">remains $269</a>, so customers opting for the Apple silicon model now receive a slight discount.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new lower prices are also available in other countries we've checked, such as Canada, with discounts varying based on the local currency.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers who recently purchased AppleCare+ for one of the affected MacBook models can contact Apple Support for assistance with cancelling their current AppleCare+ plan and purchasing a new one at the lower price, according to information obtained by MacRumors, but Apple did not provide a cutoff date for eligibility.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAppleCare+ for Mac provides up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other damage. AppleCare+ also provides 24/7 priority access to Apple's technical support representatives by online chat or phone.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/17/applecare-prices-lowered-for-m1-macbook-air-pro/\">Apple Lowers Prices of AppleCare+ Plans for M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lowers-prices-of-applecare-plans-for-m1-macbook-air-and-macbook-pro.2301288/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qZw3L97QaAk:dhdSEmGdpgQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qZw3L97QaAk:dhdSEmGdpgQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qZw3L97QaAk\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df71cf33f8bbed04b6ec4735ef166ce3c2ddea6e462101fd2d1c1462b60483d5","category":"Apple"}
