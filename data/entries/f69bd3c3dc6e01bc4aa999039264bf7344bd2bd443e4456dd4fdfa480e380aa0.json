Though there has been plenty of speculation about her first moves, her short tenure to date means she hasn’t had much opportunity to file lawsuits or announce investigations. Amazon’s petition shows that its legal team hasn’t sat idle since her nomination as commissioner and subsequent appointment as chair.</p>\n<p>“Although Amazon profoundly disagrees with Chair Khan’s conclusions about the company,” Amazon wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20981708-1-recusal-petition-by-amazoncom-inc\">petition</a>, “it does not dispute her right to have spoken provocatively and at great length about it in her prior roles. But given her long track record of detailed pronouncements about Amazon and her repeated proclamations that Amazon has violated the antitrust laws, a reasonable observer would conclude that she no longer can consider the company’s antitrust defenses with an open mind.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777406#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777406&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f69bd3c3dc6e01bc4aa999039264bf7344bd2bd443e4456dd4fdfa480e380aa0","category":"Tech"}
