The two brothers will join the winner of <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/\">an auction</a> for a third seat on the flight, which is set to take place on July 20 of this year. Bidding for this seat is already at $2.8 million but is likely to go higher during a live auction on June 12. Proceeds from this auction will be donated to Blue Origin's foundation, Club for the Future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770426#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770426&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f0f1e0aa591c79a7845f61deca73032f6e6352e5668c4c7c7a57c671142ffbce","category":"Tech"}
