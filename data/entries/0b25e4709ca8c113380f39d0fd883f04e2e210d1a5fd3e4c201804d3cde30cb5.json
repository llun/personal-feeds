YouTube <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/youtube-apple-tv-third-generation/\">recently announced</a> that the YouTube channel will disappear in March, and now the CBS All Access channel is also being removed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-tv-3-cbs-all-access-discontinued.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"792\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782611\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThose who have a third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; are seeing a popup when logging into the CBS All Access app that says CBS All Access will no longer be available starting in March.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe timing coincides with an upcoming shift that will see CBS All Access rebranding as Paramount+. ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo\">said in September</a> that CBS All Access was being rebranded because the Paramount brand is more recognizable. The rebrand will be accompanied by original content designed to lure new subscribers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new Paramount+ app will not be available on the second and third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models, but it will be watchable on the fourth and fifth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThough there will be no app on the third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, Paramount+ content will be able to be streamed from an iOS device to a third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> will also be the only way to watch YouTube content on the third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; starting in March.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThird-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; users who are looking to upgrade to a newer model may want to hold off for the time being as Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">rumored to be introducing</a> a new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; set-top box at some point this year. The fifth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, which is the current newest version, was released in 2017.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cbs/\">CBS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/\">Third-Generation Apple TV Losing Support for CBS All Access in Transition to Paramount+ Next Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/third-generation-apple-tv-losing-support-for-cbs-all-access-in-transition-to-paramount-next-month.2284017/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VJGUsI6OkzI:THr43-5mUuc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VJGUsI6OkzI:THr43-5mUuc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VJGUsI6OkzI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0b25e4709ca8c113380f39d0fd883f04e2e210d1a5fd3e4c201804d3cde30cb5","category":"Apple"}
