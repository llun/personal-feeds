I jumped on this beta to try this feature out, and it works great. Pretty much just like the excellent longstanding feature that lets you log into your Mac automatically if you’re wearing an Apple Watch — it just works. I don’t know how much longer we’ll be wearing face masks when we go out, but this pretty much guarantees I’ll be wearing my Apple Watch every day.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that this feature was a lot trickier to implement than you might think, because of the fact that you can also use your iPhone to unlock your watch. The “chain of trust” was originally designed to work in one direction — from your iPhone to your watch.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘iOS 14.5 Beta 1 Allows Your Apple Watch to Unlock Your iPhone if You’re Wearing a Mask’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-face-masks\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"902f604a83e741c631163bfac71b68140b52cd7f03fed8dd4ca414f7ebdc4c59","category":"Tech"}
