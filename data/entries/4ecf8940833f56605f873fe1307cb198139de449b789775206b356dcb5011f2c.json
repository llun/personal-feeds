Widgets on iPad also get a new larger format to make better use of the device's larger screen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirst introduced on the iPhone in iOS 14, the App Library automatically organizes all of a user's apps into one, easy-to-navigate view and will intelligently surface apps that may be helpful at a given time. The App Library is built right into the Dock, making it simple for users to access. Additionally, the App Library allows users to hide and reorder their Home Screen pages.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ipados-15-widgets-app-library/\">iPadOS 15 Features Widgets Anywhere on Home Screen and App Library</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-15-features-widgets-anywhere-on-home-screen-and-app-library.2299547/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Fyx24rFtZgg:6HVyVy6kNOc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Fyx24rFtZgg:6HVyVy6kNOc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Fyx24rFtZgg\" />","author":"Frank McShan","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ecf8940833f56605f873fe1307cb198139de449b789775206b356dcb5011f2c","category":"Apple"}
