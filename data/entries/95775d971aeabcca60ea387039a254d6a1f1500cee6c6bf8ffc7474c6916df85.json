For example, Apple highlights its increasing use of recycled materials in its products and packaging, emphasis on environmentally-conscious design, and use of renewable energy, to reduce carbon emissions. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple explained that increasing a device's power efficiency can significantly reduce the carbon emissions a device instigates over the course of its use. For example, it mentioned that the low power-per-watt requirements of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip have reduced the overall carbon footprint of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> by as much as 34 percent.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe company addressed some of the more controversial environmental decisions that it has taken over the past year, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-12-ships-without-earpods-or-charger/\">removing the power adapter and EarPods</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. Apple says that this will save 861,000 metric tons of copper, tin, and zinc from being unnecessarily mined from the earth. The move allowed for thinner ‌iPhone‌ boxes, which meant that 70 percent more iPhones can now fit in every shipping pallet, reducing overall the carbon footprint of device transportation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe report also drew attention to Apple's recent announcement of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/apple-launches-restore-fund/\">$200 million contribution</a> to the \"Restore Fund,\" which will make investments in forestry projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSee the full <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2021.pdf\">PDF version of Apple's 2021 Environmental Progress Report</a> for more information.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-environment/\">Apple environment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/environment/\">environment</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/apple-2021-environmental-progress-report/\">Apple Shares 2021 Environmental Progress Report</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-2021-environmental-progress-report.2291914/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n8WAmrywLlc:4_XAz2CPmko:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n8WAmrywLlc:4_XAz2CPmko:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/n8WAmrywLlc\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"95775d971aeabcca60ea387039a254d6a1f1500cee6c6bf8ffc7474c6916df85","category":"Apple"}
