But on Thursday afternoon, the space agency got to taste some success with what appeared to be a nominal ground test-firing of the vehicle's core stage.</p>\n<p>With brilliant spring sunshine blazing overhead, the four space shuttle main engines that power the rocket roared to life on a test stand in Mississippi. Then they burned for 499.6 seconds, exhausting the vehicle's supply of liquid oxygen.</p>\n\n<p>At about one minute into the test, the engines began rocking and rolling. Known as gimbaling, this process is what allows a rocket to change the direction of thrust in flight. This dynamic exercise lasted for about 30 seconds and appeared to proceed nominally as well.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750703#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750703&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da4523045747db5880565edac31d486f717149f5c5fb575c819e708f5f3aeabf","category":"Tech"}
