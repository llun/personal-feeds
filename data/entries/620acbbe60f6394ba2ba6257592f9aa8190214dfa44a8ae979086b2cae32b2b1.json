{"title":"New Apple Music 'Saylists' Geared Towards Speech Therapy for Children","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/apple-music-saylists-speech-therapy/","date":1616667295000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> has partnered with Warner Music and Accenture Interactive's Rothco to launch \"Saylists\" â€“ playlists of songs selected to help young people with a speech-sound disorder, or SSD.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/saylist-apple-music.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"779\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790746\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56513756\"><em>BBC</em></a>, the project uses algorithms to find song lyrics in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s vast library of tracks that repeat challenging sounds, allowing listeners to sing along as a form of speech therapy.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGetting children with SSD to repeat challenging syllables, words, and phrases is considered to be one of the most successful therapeutic strategies, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.musicweek.com/digital/read/warner-music-partners-with-rothco-on-apple-music-playlists-for-speech-therapy/082907\">Musicweek</a></em>. The repetition involved can be tedious and draining for children, which is why the \"Saylists\" are designed to add a fun and engaging element to that experience. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSo far, the algorithm has selected 173 tracks that meet its criteria, including Dua Lipa's \"Don't Start Now,\" Lizzo's \"Good As Hell,\" and Fatboy Slim's \"Right Here, Right Now.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists chief executive Kamini Gadhok told BBC News: \"We're always pleased to hear about innovative approaches that support speech-and-language therapists in their work. As with all new techniques and tools, we recommend effective evaluation and monitoring of outcomes.\"</blockquote>The \"Saylists\" are English-language only and can only be accessed by &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers in the United Kingdom, where one in 12 children experience some form of SSD. Whether the program will be extended to other regions and territories remains unknown.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/apple-music-saylists-speech-therapy/\">New Apple Music &#039;Saylists&#039; Geared Towards Speech Therapy for Children</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-music-saylists-geared-towards-speech-therapy-for-children.2289549/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_kVhQd054Ck:VXcCJN_eb7I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_kVhQd054Ck:VXcCJN_eb7I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_kVhQd054Ck\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"620acbbe60f6394ba2ba6257592f9aa8190214dfa44a8ae979086b2cae32b2b1","category":"Apple"}
