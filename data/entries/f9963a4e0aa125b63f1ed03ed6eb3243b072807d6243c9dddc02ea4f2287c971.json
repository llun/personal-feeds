{"title":"Hygiene Theater Is Still a Huge Waste of Time in Fight Against COVID-19","link":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/hygiene-theater-still-waste/617939/","date":1613099574000,"content":"\n<p>Derek Thompson, writing for The Atlantic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Six months ago, I <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/\">wrote</a> that Americans had embraced a\nbackwards view of the coronavirus. Too many people imagined the\nfight against COVID-19 as a land war to be waged with sudsy\nhand-to-hand combat against grimy surfaces. Meanwhile, the science\nsuggested we should be focused on an aerial strategy. The virus\nspreads most efficiently through the air via the spittle spray\nthat we emit when we exhale — especially when we cough, talk\nloudly, sing, or exercise. I called this conceptual error, and the\nbonanza of pointless power-scrubbing that it had inspired,\n“hygiene theater.”</p>\n\n<p>My chief inspiration was an <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30561-2/fulltext\">essay</a> in the medical journal The\nLancet called “Exaggerated Risk of Transmission of COVID-19 by\nFomites.” (<em>Fomites</em> is a medical term for objects and surfaces\nthat can pass along an infectious pathogen.) Its author was\nEmanuel Goldman, a microbiology professor at Rutgers New Jersey\nMedical School. At the time, Goldman was a lonely voice in the\nwilderness. Lysol wipes were flying off the shelves, and it was\ncontroversial to suggest that this behavior was anything less than\nsaintly and salutary. Other journals had rejected Goldman’s short\nessay, and some were still publishing frightening research about\nthe possible danger of our groceries and Amazon packages.</p>\n\n<p>But half a year later, Goldman looks oracular. Since last spring,\nthe CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html\">has expanded</a> its guidance to clarify that the\ncoronavirus “spreads less commonly through contact with\ncontaminated surfaces.” In the past month, the leading scientific\njournal Nature published both a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4\">long analysis</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00277-8\">sharp\neditorial</a> reiterating Goldman’s thesis. “A year into the\npandemic, the evidence is now clear,” the editorial begins.\n“Catching the virus from surfaces — although plausible — seems\nto be rare.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Hygiene Theater Is Still a Huge Waste of Time in Fight Against COVID-19’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/11/thompson-covid-hygiene-theater\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f9963a4e0aa125b63f1ed03ed6eb3243b072807d6243c9dddc02ea4f2287c971","category":"Tech"}
