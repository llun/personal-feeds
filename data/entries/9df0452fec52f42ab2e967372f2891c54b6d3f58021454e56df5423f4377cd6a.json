That might sound like an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20\">international meeting</a> of world smartphone leaders, but it's an actual device arriving in the US on July 1 for just $199. For this low price point, the phone doesn't look bad.</p>\n<p>The specs include a 6.5-inch, 1600×720 LCD; a Mediatek G35 SoC; 4GB of RAM; 64GB of storage; and a 5050 mAh battery. HMD says a full charge will provide \"three-day battery life.\" There's a USB-C port for 10 W charging, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a side fingerprint reader, a microSD slot, NFC, Wi-Fi up to 802.11n, and a hardware Google Assistant button, along with the usual power and volume buttons.</p>\n<p>It's notable when an Android phone launches in the US without a Qualcomm processor. The G20 gets the Mediatek G35 SoC, a 12 nm chip with eight ARM Cortex A53 cores—four at 2.3 GHz and four at 1.8 GHz. An equivalent Qualcomm SoC would be something like the <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-439-mobile-platform\">Snapdragon 439</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775578#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775578&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9df0452fec52f42ab2e967372f2891c54b6d3f58021454e56df5423f4377cd6a","category":"Tech"}
