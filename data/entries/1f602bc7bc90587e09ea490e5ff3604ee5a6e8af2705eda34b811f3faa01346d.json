It is not unique within sport, but we must face it head on all the same.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US-based Axeon Hagens Berman squad, run by Axel Merckx, has long been one of the sport’s premier development teams, and currently races at the Continental level. Alongside Geoghegan Hart, other alumni include João Almeida, Ruben Guerreiro, Jasper Stuyven, and Jasper Philipsen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his Tour de France debut looming, Geoghegan Hart said on Friday that he and Mercx have opened applications for the spot, which he noted is “aimed toward the progression of diversity and inclusivity within the amazing sport of Cycling.”</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQixNOsiS8E/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <p></p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQixNOsiS8E/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQixNOsiS8E/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Tao Geoghegan Hart (@taogeogheganhart)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/tao-geoghegan-hart-invites-applications-for-the-axeon-roster-spot-he-is-funding/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1f602bc7bc90587e09ea490e5ff3604ee5a6e8af2705eda34b811f3faa01346d","category":"Cycling"}
