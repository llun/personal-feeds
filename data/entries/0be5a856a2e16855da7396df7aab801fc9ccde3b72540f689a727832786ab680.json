Facebook will also offer podcast creators an optional feature that lets listeners create clips of shows of up to one minute in length for sharing. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook isn't asking for a cut of any revenue that podcasters generate, but the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/podcast_terms\">terms of service</a> state that Facebook reserves the right to make \"derivative works\" with content distributed on its platform.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe move follows growing interest in podcasts as another potential market of original content, with Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-launches-podcasts-subscriptions/\">launching</a> its own paid subscriptions service in the Podcasts app. Apple takes 30% of all subscription revenue that creators generate in their first year on the platform, and after that, Apple takes a 15% cut.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotify has invested heavily in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/20/spotify-signs-up-the-joe-rogan-experience-podcast/\">deals</a> to exclusively distribute podcast shows in recent years, and offers a <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/\">similar podcast subscription feature</a> to Apple, except the streaming service doesn't collect revenue on any of the content it hosts.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/17/facebook-launch-podcast-platform-next-week/\">Facebook to Launch Podcast Publishing Platform Next Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-to-launch-podcast-publishing-platform-next-week.2301238/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V6aK8bY56rg:L0o1AoQTuV4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=V6aK8bY56rg:L0o1AoQTuV4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/V6aK8bY56rg\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0be5a856a2e16855da7396df7aab801fc9ccde3b72540f689a727832786ab680","category":"Apple"}
