While it was easy to overcome this tendency with some simple nudges, the researchers suggest that this thought process may underlie some of the growing complexity of the modern world.</p>\n<h2>Let’s add stuff</h2>\n<p>The researchers say they got interested in the topic because they noticed that beyond the admonition that less is more, many fields had specific advice about improvement through subtraction. Editors caution writers about using excess language, social scientists talk about the need to remove barriers, and so on. In contrast, there are few reminders to add stuff to fix problems.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755231#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755231&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9c6764706abb6745b076f33b0b1ce7ca3ba415aa315fd281bba4313ef8f4745","category":"Tech"}
