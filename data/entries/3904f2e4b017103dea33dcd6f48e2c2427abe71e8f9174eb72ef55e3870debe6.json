{"title":"macOS 11.3 Patches Security Vulnerability That Bypassed Built-In Malware Protections","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/macos-11-3-security-fix/","date":1619460221000,"content":"Apple today <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/\">confirmed to <em>TechCrunch</em></a> that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-3/\">just-released macOS 11.3 software update</a> patches a security vulnerability that reportedly could have allowed a hacker to remotely access a user's sensitive data by tricking a user into opening a spoofed document.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-security-banner.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\"All the user would need to do is double click — and no macOS prompts or warnings are generated,\" said security researcher Cedric Owens, who discovered the vulnerability in mid-March, according to the report. Owens developed a proof-of-concept app masquerading as a harmless document that exploits the bug to launch the Calculator app, but he said the vulnerability could be exploited for more nefarious purposes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to security researcher Patrick Wardle, the vulnerability was the result of a logic bug in macOS's underlying code.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"In simple terms, macOS apps aren't a single file but a bundle of different files that the app needs to work, including a property list file that tells the application where the files it depends on are located,\" explains <em>TechCrunch</em>. \"But Owens found that taking out this property file and building the bundle with a particular structure could trick macOS into opening the bundle — and running the code inside — without triggering any warnings.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to fixing the bug in macOS 11.3, Apple told <em>TechCrunch</em> it patched earlier macOS versions to prevent abuse, and updated macOS's built-in anti-malware system XProtect to block malware from exploiting the vulnerability. The report says the bug was exploited for months, but it's unclear how many users were impacted. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/macos-11-3-security-fix/\">macOS 11.3 Patches Security Vulnerability That Bypassed Built-In Malware Protections</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-11-3-patches-security-vulnerability-that-bypassed-built-in-malware-protections.2293352/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3zu4MeRHS8Y:XxbMocsTxCw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3zu4MeRHS8Y:XxbMocsTxCw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3zu4MeRHS8Y\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3904f2e4b017103dea33dcd6f48e2c2427abe71e8f9174eb72ef55e3870debe6","category":"Apple"}
