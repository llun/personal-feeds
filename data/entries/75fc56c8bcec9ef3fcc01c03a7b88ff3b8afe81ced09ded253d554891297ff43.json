{"title":"Leaker Suggests Apple Event to Be Held on March 23","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/","date":1615199148000,"content":"Apple will hold its first event of the year on March 23, according to information provided by a reputable Chinese leaker (via <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1368857262823936000\">DuanRui</a></em>). Apple is expected to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, new iPads, and possibly updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> at a spring event, and leaker \"Kang\" believes that date will be March 23. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-08-at-1.00.47-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2160\" height=\"1176\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787459\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nInitial speculation pointed to an event happening on March 16; however, <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/no-apple-event-march-16/\">shot down the possibility</a>, leaving the door open for an event later on in the month. Kang says that Apple's event will be held on the same date as the OnePlus 9 reveal, which is scheduled for Tuesday, March 23.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDue to the global health crisis, Apple's event is expected to be held digitally and live-streamed via its website and official YouTube channel. March 23 and March 30 are both reasonable guesses for when Apple is set to hold an event. Apple tends to hold events on Tuesday and is also expected to hold an event in the \"early spring\" to coincide with the launch of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14.5. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOfficial details about Apple's event remain unknown. However, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/ios-14-5-item-safety-feature/\">mounting evidence</a> of the imminent release of &zwnj;AirTags&zwnj; suggests Apple's Tile-like tracker could debut at the rumored March 23 event. <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/29/mini-led-ipad-pro-macbook-coming-2021/\">DigiTimes</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/kuo-ipad-mini-led-airpods-3-coming-1h21/\">others</a>, have also suggested Apple will release updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models with mini-LED displays and faster processors in the first half of the year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nShortly after Kang suggested the March 23 date, YouTube personality and hit-or-miss Apple leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1368859296507760641\">tweeted</a> \"23,\" in an apparent show of support for Kang and his event date prediction.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLast year, Kang was first to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/09/apple-to-launch-magsage-iphone-chargers/\">accurately reveal</a> that Apple planned to revive the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> brand for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, and also leaked accurate details and launch dates for the full &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; lineup and the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> before they were officially announced.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kang/\">Kang</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">Leaker Suggests Apple Event to Be Held on March 23</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-suggests-apple-event-to-be-held-on-march-23.2287514/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VE7J28ZfZPY:KLvvwIvh3Dk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VE7J28ZfZPY:KLvvwIvh3Dk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VE7J28ZfZPY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"75fc56c8bcec9ef3fcc01c03a7b88ff3b8afe81ced09ded253d554891297ff43","category":"Apple"}
