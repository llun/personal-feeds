Add the ability to customise the spec and the wide sizing range, and there’s an Aether 9 package for everyone.”</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>The contenders</h4>\n<p>A decent trail bike should also be fast and capable on the descents, but with less weight and travel (130–150mm) than enduro bikes, they’re nimbler on flatter trails, less of a drag on longer rides and better on the climbs.</p>\n<p>The following bikes were shortlisted for our Trail Bike of the Year award, with a price range of £2,999.99 to £4,695.</p>\n<ul><li>Bird Aether 9 (winner)</li>\n<li>Canyon Spectral 29 CF 7</li>\n<li>Intense Primer 29 Expert</li>\n<li>Lapierre Zesty AM CF 6.9</li>\n<li>Privateer 141 SLX/XT</li>\n<li>Propain Hugene</li>\n<li>Saracen Ariel 30 Pro</li>\n<li>YT Jeffsy Blaze 29</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h3>Enduro Bike of the Year – Trek Slash 8</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> “The Trek Slash 8 strikes the perfect balance between a fun and lively feel, and ultimate chaos-calming composure,” says Rob, who led our enduro testing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Technical editor-in-chief, Robin Weaver: “The Trek really did come in and surprise us.

Our biggest issue was getting hold of bikes. The surge in cycling over the past year, coupled with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/pandemic-brexit-bike-prices/\">delays brought about by the global pandemic and Brexit</a>, meant it wasn’t easy to call in the models we wanted.</p>\n<p>That’s why we have eight contenders each in the Trail and Enduro categories, rather than 10 as in previous years, and why pricing varies more than usual.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once again, our Bike of the Year test is brought to you in conjunction with MBUK magazine.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We could have just included the most expensive bikes available, as these weren’t selling as fast as cheaper models, in a bid to shoehorn every major brand into the test – but, while we all enjoy lusting over the latest superbikes, it would have put the winners frustratingly out of reach for most readers.</p>\n<p>Instead, we’ve stuck with our trail and enduro categories, and packed them with some of the most exciting bikes on the market. While these aren’t cheap bikes by any stretch of the imagination, and they may require some serious saving-up, hopefully they won’t completely break the bank.</p>\n<p>We think these bikes hit a sweetspot between attainable pricing and all-out performance. Importantly, most are available in cheaper or more expensive builds, to suit your budget.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4><span>Meet the tester – Tom Marvin</span></h4>\n<p><span>Keen on Lycra-clad XC laps, as well as rooty off-piste, Tom is well-placed to rate the all-rounders that make up our Trail Bike of the Year test.</span></p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n            <div>\n            <div>\n                <div><img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/Tom-Marvin-3cdcd43.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=556,556\" /></div><div><figcaption>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</figcaption></div></div>\n        </div>\n    </section><h2>The criteria</h2>\n<p>Our trail bike category – arguably the toughest to define – includes machines costing between £2,999.99 and £4,695 (thanks to one bike coming with the wrong spec and another’s price being pushed up), and spans rear wheel travel from 130mm to 150mm.</p>\n<p>The way we see it, the winner should be more than capable of accompanying you on an all-day XC epic, but you wouldn’t wince at the prospect of tackling the odd <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro race</a> on it or even taking it on an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/how-to-survive-mountain-biking-in-the-alps/\">alpine holiday</a>.</p>\n<p>Enduro bikes are easier to categorise. If you’ve ever watched high-profile events such as the Enduro World Series, you’ll know these machines are designed for hauling uphill and then pummelling back down, time and time again.</p>\n<p>That means they still need to feel comfortable when pointed up the side of a mountain, but possess all the poise and control of a scaled-down <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bike</a> when it comes to racing back down. Pricing for this category runs from £3,450 to £4,198, while travel varies from 153mm all the way up to 180mm.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Meet the tester – Robin Weaver</h4>\n<p>With plenty of international racing experience, Rob knows what makes a good descender and led our Enduro Bike of the Year test.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n            <div>\n            <div>\n                <div><img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/Robin-Weaver-1028ca7.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=556,556\" /></div><div><figcaption>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</figcaption></div></div>\n        </div>\n    </section><h2>From our local tracks to BikePark Wales</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Having completed their initial testing on local trails, Rob and Tom headed to BikePark Wales.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Once we’d sorted the bikes, the next hurdle was complying with social-distancing rules and travel restrictions. These precluded our regular tester <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/sarahgamsjager/\">Sarah Gamsjäger</a> from adding her input, as in years past.</p>\n<p>We also needed to work out how to test the bikes effectively while staying local, until our friends at <a href=\"https://www.bikeparkwales.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BikePark Wales</a> offered to host some private testing sessions. Although this required some (work-related) travel, it meant there would be zero risk of coming into contact with other trail users and potentially spreading infection.</p>\n<p>As ever, we’ve spent countless hours riding, tinkering, riding some more, measuring, then riding even more, to establish a winner in each category.
