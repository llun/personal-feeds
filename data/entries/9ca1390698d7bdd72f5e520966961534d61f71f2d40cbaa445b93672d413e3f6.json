To get a jump-start, we’ll need to double our investments in clean technologies to $4 trillion by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>“The pathway to net zero by 2050 is narrow but still achievable if governments act now,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbirol/status/1394518316258054145\">tweet</a>. Most of the reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions through 2030 come from technologies already on the market. But in 2050, almost half come from technologies that, while known, are still in development now.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765722#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765722&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9ca1390698d7bdd72f5e520966961534d61f71f2d40cbaa445b93672d413e3f6","category":"Tech"}
