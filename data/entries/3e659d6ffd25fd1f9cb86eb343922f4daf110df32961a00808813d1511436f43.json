There are slightly different variations on the design, but this is by far the most common design on modern drop-bar bikes. They are sometimes referred to as brifters.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Related reading</h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Road bike groupsets: everything you need to know</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Mountain bike groupsets: everything you need to know</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-road-bike/\">What is a road bike?

When we use it on BikeRadar, we use it in its most literal interpretation:</p>\n<ul><li>Up the cassette = from a smaller cog to a larger cog</li>\n<li>Down the cassette = from a larger cog to a smaller cog</li>\n</ul><p>With that roughly as clear as mud, here’s how you actually go about using your road shifters.</p>\n<h2>How to change gears on a bike</h2>\n<h3>How to use Shimano road bike shifters</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> STI shifters integrate shifting and braking into one unit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Shimano Total Integration (STI) shifters use a split lever design to change gears.</p>\n<p>A small lever just behind the brake lever shifts the chain onto a smaller cog, while the whole brake lever can be pushed to the side to shift to a larger cog.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Right-hand shifter controls rear shifting:</strong> Push the inner, smaller paddle inboard (sweeping from right to left) to shift down the cassette into a smaller cog (a bigger/harder gear). Push the brake lever inboard (the small shift paddle will come with it) to shift up the cassette into a larger (easier/smaller) gear.</li>\n<li><strong>Left-hand shifter controls front shifting: </strong>Push the inner, smaller paddle inboard (sweeping from left to right) to drop down into the smaller (a smaller/easier) chainring. Push the brake lever inboard (the small shift paddle will come with it) to shift into a larger (a bigger/harder) chainring.</li>\n</ul><p>Shimano shifters also feature a trim function on the front (left-hand) lever. Shifting the inboard lever with a smaller throw (roughly half as much as a normal shift) will move the cage of the front derailleur inboard to stop the chain rubbing in certain gears.</p>\n<p>Di2 (electronic) Shimano gears function in exactly the same way, but the mechanical innards of the shifting mechanism are replaced with small buttons. These can, however, be re-programmed to suit your needs and desires.</p>\n<h3>How to use SRAM road bike shifters</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> DoubleTap levers use a single paddle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM DoubleTap shifters use a single paddle to shift both up and down. A short click will shift into a smaller cog, and pushing the lever further will shift into a larger cog.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Right-hand shifter controls rear shifting:</strong> Push the paddle inboard (sweeping right to left) a small amount to shift down the cassette into a smaller cog (a bigger/harder gear).

Functionality can be customised almost endlessly, but set up to its factory defaults:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Right-hand paddle: </strong>Click the shift paddle to shift down the cassette into a smaller cog (a larger/harder) gear.</li>\n<li><strong>Left-hand paddle:</strong> Click the shift paddle to shift up the cassette into a larger cog (a smaller/easier) gear.</li>\n<li><strong>Both paddles together: </strong>Push both shift paddles simultaneously to shift between chainrings</li>\n</ul><h3>How to use Campagnolo road bike shifters</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Campagnolo shifters have a small thumb lever on the inboard edge of the lever body.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robin Wilmott / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo shifters are slightly different again – a shift lever behind the brake lever shifts into a larger cog/chainring on both the front and rear, while a thumb-operated paddle on the inside of the hood shifts into a smaller cog/chainring.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Right-hand shifter controls rear shifting:</strong> Push the shift lever behind the brake lever inboard (sweeping right to left) to shift up the cassette into a larger cog (a smaller/easier gear).

These are very similar to thumb shifters and are available in both indexed and friction shifter forms.</p>\n<p>These have popped up a little more recently providing a simple way of combining a hub gear with drop-bar brake levers.</p>\n<p>Down-tube shifters work in much the same way, but as the name suggests, these are located on the down tube of the bike.</p>\n<p>Moving either of these levers towards or away from you will shift up or down the cassette or crankset.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"3e659d6ffd25fd1f9cb86eb343922f4daf110df32961a00808813d1511436f43","category":"Cycling"}
