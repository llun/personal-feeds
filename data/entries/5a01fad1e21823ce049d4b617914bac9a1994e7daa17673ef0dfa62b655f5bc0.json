Welcome to Women’s Cycling Weekly issue 19 🚴‍♀️</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a really exciting week of racing yet again and with Flanders coming up on Sunday there’s still plenty to look forward to. As you’ll find out later on in this newsletter it’s also been a great week for women’s cycling content. PLUS this week I have a cheeky little competition for you. So now I’ve added that sneaky little teaser, have a read on to find out more!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>News&nbsp;📰</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Scratch out the 11th April from your diary because it’s official,&nbsp;<strong>Paris Roubaix</strong>&nbsp;is postponed. The inaugural women’s race will now take place on Saturday 2nd October, a day before the men’s event on Sunday 3rd.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The Lotto Belgium Tour&nbsp;</strong>organisers<strong>&nbsp;</strong>have decided to bring the race forward so as not to clash with&nbsp;<strong>La Course</strong>. The new dates are 22nd-25th June.&nbsp;</li><li>Zwift Academy winner&nbsp;<strong>Neve Bradbury</strong>&nbsp;had her first race in Europe with her&nbsp;<strong>Canyon//SRAM</strong>&nbsp;teammates at Dwars door Vlaanderen on Wednesday.</li><li>A group of UK cyclists have launched an equal prize money kitemark&nbsp;for events. the&nbsp;<strong>EPiC (Equality and Parity in Cycling) kitemark</strong>&nbsp;was launched by the group of campaigners who petitioned for equal payouts for time trial events in the UK after the disparity at hill climb races was revealed. Find out more via their website&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epic-group.org/the-kitemark\">here</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>The much-anticipated&nbsp;<strong>Battle of the North</strong>&nbsp;is one step closer to becoming a reality!&nbsp;<strong>The Tour of Norway</strong>&nbsp;organisers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ladiestour.no/battle-of-the-north-et-steg-naermere-realisering/\">announced</a>&nbsp;on Monday that the event is pencilled in for August 16-21 2022 and will feature across Denmark, Norway and Sweden. However, the organisers of the two&nbsp;<strong>Vårgårda WWT</strong>&nbsp;events in Sweden opted out of the partnership meaning that the event cannot run across the originally-planned 10-day time frame. (We’ll be hearing more from LToN later in the newsletter).</li><li>The race director of the&nbsp;<strong>2022 cyclocross world championships</strong>&nbsp;in Arkansas, Brook Watts, has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/2022-cyclo-cross-worlds-organisers-fear-boycott-over-arkansas-anti-transgender-bill/\">appealed to fans not to boycott the event&nbsp;</a>after the state governor, Asa Hutchinson, signed a bill to ban transgender women and girls from competing in school sports. Watts described the bill as ‘hateful.’&nbsp;</li><li>Great news for&nbsp;<strong>Team Coop &#8211; Hitec Products</strong>&nbsp;who — as a result of the additional sponsorship from Coop — have been able to increase their riders’ salaries in line with the men’s team who share their sponsors. Manager Karl Lima&nbsp;<a href=\"https://teamhitecproducts.no/equal-payment-team-coop-hitec-products-and-team-coop-riders/\">said in a press release</a>: “The arrival of Coop as a sponsor allows us to support the riders and provide them with equal opportunities as the men’s team.” Love to see it.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEWS | Equal payment Team Coop – Hitec Products and Team Coop riders.

Van Vleuten launched an attack — as&nbsp;<strong>Movistar</strong>&nbsp;teammate&nbsp;Leah Thomas&nbsp;was getting caught from an earlier break — which only&nbsp;Kasia Niewiadoma&nbsp;could follow. The two broke away together with around 36km to go and stayed clear, with van Vleuten winning the sprint for first and Niewiadoma’s&nbsp;Canyon//SRAM&nbsp;teammate&nbsp;Alexis Ryan&nbsp;winning the bunch kick for third.

It was so insightful and interesting on the women who have shaped what it means to be a female cyclist and highlights some incredible stories from women on two wheels. Ross links issues that have faced female cyclists both past and present and reveals some extraordinary details and legendary figures.
