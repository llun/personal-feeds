Besides CVE-2021-22893, as the zeroday is tracked, multiple hacking groups—at least one that likely works on behalf of the Chinese government—are also exploiting several Pulse Secure vulnerabilities fixed in 2019 and 2020.</p>\n<h2>Under siege</h2>\n<p>“Mandiant is currently tracking 12 malware families associated with the exploitation of Pulse Secure VPN devices,” researchers Dan Perez, Sarah Jones, Greg Wood, and Stephen Eckels wrote. “These families are related to the circumvention of authentication and backdoor access to these devices, but they are not necessarily related to each other and have been observed in separate investigations. It is likely that multiple actors are responsible for the creation and deployment of these various code families.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758789#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758789&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7688156f4971e792579b0930cd6bbb71424157cc69ae5026d5f1d615306c2497","category":"Tech"}
