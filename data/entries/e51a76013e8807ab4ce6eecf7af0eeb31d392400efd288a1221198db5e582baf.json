[…]</p>\n\n<p>Tile has also been vocal against Apple’s entry into the lost-item\ntracking space, recently telling Congress that it and other <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/google-and-apple-scare-us-app-makers-tell-congress.html\">app\ndevelopers are “afraid” of Apple’s\npolicies</a>\nfor third-party apps and hardware accessories.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon’s partnership will allow it beef up its tracking network,\ncalled Sidewalk, by letting Tile and Level devices tap into the\nBluetooth networks created by millions of its Echo products. Tile\nwill start working with Amazon’s network beginning June 14.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Something tells me Tile is not going to be joining <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/07/find-my-third-party-products\">Apple’s third-party program for “Find My”</a> anytime soon.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/19/amazon-tile\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e51a76013e8807ab4ce6eecf7af0eeb31d392400efd288a1221198db5e582baf","category":"Tech"}
