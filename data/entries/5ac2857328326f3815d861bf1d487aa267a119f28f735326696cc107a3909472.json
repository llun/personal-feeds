{"title":"Disney+ Now Has 95 Million Subscribers","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/disney-plus-95-million-subscribers/","date":1613079920000,"content":"During its earnings report covering the fourth quarter of 2020, Disney today announced that it has surpassed 94.9 million subscribers (via <em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/disney-says-it-now-has-94point9-million-disney-plus-subscribers.html\">CNBC</a></em>).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/11/disney-ios.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1168\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-719674\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen Disney+ launched, Disney set a goal of hitting 60 million to 90 million subscribers by 2024, a milestone that it reached before the end of 2020. Disney has since re-forecasted and now expects to have 230 to 260 million subscribers by 2024.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith that kind of subscriber growth, Disney+ will likely surpass Netflix. Netflix <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-q4-2020-earnings-200-million-subscribers-1234887784/\">in January said</a> that it had more than 200 million subscribers worldwide.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDisney+ launched at the same time as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, but Disney has seen incredibly rapid growth, reaching 10 million subscribers on the first day and 50 million subscribers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/08/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers/\">at the five month mark</a>. In December, Disney+ was at 86.8 million subscribers, so it has gained eight million subscribers in a month.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple does not provide &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; subscriber numbers so there's no direct comparison to make, but if Apple had Disney+ numbers, Apple executives likely would have mentioned it. &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; has not been able to compete with Disney+ because of Disney's established catalog of content along with popular Star Wars and Marvel original shows.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has been ramping up its selection of movies and TV shows, but it will be years before the company has a catalog that can compete with most other streaming services.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/disney-plus-95-million-subscribers/\">Disney+ Now Has 95 Million Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-now-has-95-million-subscribers.2284312/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QH_Fo31q1gM:n1Rtg1bDf0M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QH_Fo31q1gM:n1Rtg1bDf0M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QH_Fo31q1gM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5ac2857328326f3815d861bf1d487aa267a119f28f735326696cc107a3909472","category":"Apple"}
