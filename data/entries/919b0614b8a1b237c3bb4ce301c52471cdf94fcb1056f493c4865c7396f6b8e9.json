With ‌Apple Pay‌, users can easily add their credit or debit cards from supported banks to their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Apple Watch to make purchases at contactless payment terminals around the world. ‌Apple Pay‌ is also available on the Mac for web purchases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt launch, there may be some banks that don't yet have support for ‌Apple Pay‌; however, the list of supported banks will grow with time. Users can add a card to ‌Apple Pay‌ by heading over to the Wallet app on ‌iPhone‌, pressing the plus button in the top-right hand corner, and following the on-screen prompts.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/israel/\">Israel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/apple-pay-launches-in-israel/\">Apple Pay Launches in Israel</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-launches-in-israel.2294878/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Mi-Ksddgc4s:i480qT5dG1o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Mi-Ksddgc4s:i480qT5dG1o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Mi-Ksddgc4s\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"919b0614b8a1b237c3bb4ce301c52471cdf94fcb1056f493c4865c7396f6b8e9","category":"Apple"}
