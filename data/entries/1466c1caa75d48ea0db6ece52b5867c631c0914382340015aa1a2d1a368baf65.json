One by one, automakers have warned that the silicon chip shortage will negatively impact production output and revenues in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Renault identified the chip shortage as a major problem when reporting its Q1 results in April. A week later, Ford said it <a href=\"https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2021/04/28/2021-ford-1q.pdf\">expects to lose half of its Q2 production</a>, up from 17 percent in Q1. And on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/stellantis-says-semiconductor-crunch-will-get-worse-this-quarter\">Stellantis Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer added to the chorus</a>, warning that \"it would be imprudent to assume that the issue is just going to go away.\"</p>\n<p>The shortage has its roots in the pandemic as carmakers canceled pending semiconductor orders in the face of heavily reduced demand for new vehicles. Since then, a drought in Taiwan and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/global-chip-shortage-worsens-forces-production-cuts-at-gm-hyundai/\">a fire at a Japanese chipmaker</a> have compounded the problem, as has strong demand for consumer electronics.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762801#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762801&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
