Arguably the most interesting among them&nbsp;is the men&#8217;s road race at the New Zealand Road Nationals where fan favourite George Bennett (Jumbo-Visma)&nbsp;<em>finally</em>&nbsp;won the silver fern jersey after a decade of trying. We look forward to seeing how Jumbo-Visma will combine&nbsp;yellow, black and silver in a jersey for Bennett this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that and all the other big-ticket items today, please read on!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt de Neef<br>Managing Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ivan Sosa wins the&nbsp;Tour de la Provence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ivan Sosa (Ineos Grenadiers) has taken out the four-stage Tour de la Provence courtesy of a solo victory on the stage 3 uphill finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 23-year-old Colombian burst free from a reduced bunch 5 km from the&nbsp;Chalet Reynard finish on a misty Mont Ventoux. He won the stage by 15 seconds ahead of teammate Egan Bernal, with world champion Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-QuickStep) right behind at 18 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Ineos Grenadiers Dominate Mont Ventoux\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_k5zDu8ZKvs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sosa held onto the overall lead by finishing safely in the bunch in Sunday&#8217;s final-stage sprint finish. Phil Bauhaus (Bahrain-Victorious) claimed stage honours ahead of stage 1 and 2 winner Davide Ballerini (Deceuninck-QuickStep) and Nacer Bouhanni (Arkea-Samsic).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alaphilippe started the final stage in third overall but overtook Bernal on GC by snagging a few bonus seconds at the first intermediate sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Tour de La Provence Photo Finish Sprint!\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-2wDzBr_kyo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Giacomo Nizzolo wins the Clasica de Almeria</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Italian and European champion Giacomo Nizzolo has claimed Qhubeka-Assos&#8217; first victory for the season with a sprint win at the Clasica de Almeria in Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029-1340x894.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-481164\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029-1340x894.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029-650x434.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029-190x127.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029-1080x721.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032887-029.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few early breakaway attempts yielded little and the race was all back together for the final 50 km. There were several crashes on the run-in to the line before Nizzolo powered away from Florian Senechal (Deceuninck-QuickStep) and Martin Laas (Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am really happy about today&#8217;s victory and the great job the team did today,&#8221; Nizzolo said.&nbsp;&#8220;From the start we tried to control the race, but the race was a bit strange, kind of on-and-off a few times because of the wind. The final was quite tricky but we managed to have a good position for the sprint.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>George Bennett wins Kiwi Nationals road race</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a decade of trying, George Bennett finally has a national road race title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The affable 30-year-old had taken silver on two occasions (2013 and 2020) but had never managed the top step. Not until&nbsp;Sunday&#8217;s 174 km circuit race around Cambridge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bennett attacked multiple times throughout, particularly on the four ascents of the French Pass climb, but it was on flat road 8 km from the finish that he finally broke clear. He soloed to victory by 1:48 ahead of Mark Stewart with Michael Torckler right behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003-1340x876.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-481167\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003-1340x876.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003-650x425.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003-190x124.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003-1080x706.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-003.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was down and out a week ago and wrote myself off,&#8221; Bennett said.&nbsp;&#8220;I was a month behind last year and I was doing a workout on the time trial bike and I was not there. Then I had a really good TT on Friday and that picked me up quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I am excited and proud to wear that jersey, to take it to Europe and represent New Zealand Cycling because it is a special thing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the week Bennett finished second to Aaron Gate (Black Spoke) in the time trial. Impressively, 19-year-old Finn-Fisher Black (Jumbo-Visma Development Team) was faster than all the elite riders to win the U23 title on the same course.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Georgia Williams wins another Kiwi road title</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the women&#8217;s race meanwhile, Georgia Williams (BikeExchange) rode to her second &#8216;Double&#8217; at the Kiwi Nationals.&nbsp;Just like she did in 2018, the 27-year-old won both the time trial and the road race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the road race Williams attacked just 7 km into the 130 km race around Cambridge, with only full-time police officer Kate McCarthy able to follow. The pair led for the remaining 120 km of the race before Williams won the two-up sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026-1340x1028.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-481170\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026-1340x1028.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026-650x499.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026-190x146.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026-1080x829.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026-16x12.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032884-026.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was sort of in the back of my mind that I wanted to go early, just because if I waited too long then the sprinters might have been able to hang on,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;But I was a little bit surprised and thought maybe it’s too early. But I knew Kate was super strong, so I knew we would be ok.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams won Friday&#8217;s time trial by 22 seconds ahead of Jaime Nielsen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Richard Freeman charged with two rule violations by UK Anti-Doping</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/56044437\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BBC is reporting</a>&nbsp;that former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman has been charged by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) for two violations of its anti-doping rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Britain&#8217;s national broadcaster, Freeman has been charged with &#8220;possession of a prohibited substance&#8221; and &#8220;tampering or attempted tampering with any part of doping control&#8221;. Freeman has reportedly contested the charges and has requested a hearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Freeman is found guilty by an independent anti-doping panel, he could face a four-year ban from the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A special Valentine&#8217;s Day message from Cyrus Monk</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally today, here&#8217;s something a little more light-hearted –&nbsp;Australian cyclist/musician/scientist Cyrus Monk with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cyrus_Monk/status/1360834745291055107\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wonderful little cover version</a>&nbsp;of a classic track&nbsp;for Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">❤️ Valentine’s Day Special ❤️ <a href=\"https://t.co/zDOI7AH3lm\">pic.twitter.com/zDOI7AH3lm</a></p>— Cyrus Monk (@Cyrus_Monk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cyrus_Monk/status/1360834745291055107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it &#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Firmware further improves Assioma power meter pedals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedals were already great, now they&#8217;re&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/free-firmware-update-further-improves-assioma-power-pedals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">even better</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women&#8217;s Cycling Weekly, Issue 12</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy Jones rounds up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/womens-cycling-weekly-issue-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">all the latest goings-on</a>&nbsp;in the world of women&#8217;s cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Secret Pro: Supertucks and the coming season</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new season is underway and with all of the new UCI rules,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/the-secret-pro-supertucks-and-the-coming-season/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Secret Pro</a>&nbsp;is back to dish some dirt.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/daily-news-a-win-10-years-in-the-making/\">A win 10 years in the making: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"fbd75737d15e1c2a7b749e5515eb8cd84d7d6c61dd36512ff9bf464da18bdbf1","category":"Cycling"}
