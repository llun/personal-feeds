{"title":"Estimates for How Long Each State Will Take to Reach 70 Percent Vaccination Among Adults","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/03/us/virus-vaccine-states.html","date":1622821500000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The United States is roughly on track to meet President Biden’s\ngoal of getting at least one Covid-19 shot into the arms of 70\npercent of adults by July 4 — if the current vaccination pace\nholds. But demand for vaccines has decreased in much of the\ncountry in recent weeks, and the promising national numbers (about\n63 percent of adults have received at least one shot) do not\nreflect the uneven rates among states.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the country as a whole reaches the national target, at\nleast 30 states probably will not. And a handful are unlikely to\nreach the 70 percent mark before the end of the year, a New York\nTimes analysis shows, potentially prolonging the pandemic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the bright side, even our worst-performing states on COVID vaccination rates — Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming, and Louisiana (one of these states is geographically unlike the others) — are all nearing 50 percent for adults. Even in the states seemingly most riddled with anti-vax nutters and “<em>let’s wait and see</em>” hesitants, over half of adults will soon be vaccinated. That’s pretty good. Most countries around the world would <em>love</em> to have Mississippi’s 44 percent rate.</p>\n\n<p>In a members-only post today on his excellent <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/\">Political Wire</a>, Taegan Goddard wrote the following, regarding a “Happiness Index” poll showing Americans’ happiness reaching pre-pandemic levels:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nearly everyone I meet — some of whom I haven’t seen in more than\na year — seems happier. This is almost entirely due to the\nvaccines — and their highly efficient rollout across the country\nover the last six months. Their development may be the greatest\nscientific advance of our lifetimes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t think there’s any question about that. If it weren’t for these vaccines, we’d all still be cooped up. More people would be and would get sick. More people would have died and would die.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, life is rapidly going back to normal. Fewer people are getting sick and far fewer are dying. All thanks to these amazingly effective and safe vaccines that were developed, tested, and mass-produced in about a year.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/vaccinations-by-state\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8c366b373d8d7547d3e756e1b865daf8b376eae3b336cfe55bbab7678bbfa27e","category":"Tech"}
