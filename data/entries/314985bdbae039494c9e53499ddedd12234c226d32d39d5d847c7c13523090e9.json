content?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple TV 4K streams 4K content, provided you have a TV that supports it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about HDR and Dolby Vision?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes and yes. But again, you’ll need an Apple TV 4K and TV that supports it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do I need to get started?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much all you need to buy is an HDMI cable. Any one will do, so stay away from high-priced cables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do I get 4K content?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple sells 4K movies and TV shows through the Apple TV Store. If you have a Netflix subscription, you can can upgrade to the premium plan to be able to stream 4K content. Many Netflix original shows are offered in 4K, as well as many movies. You can also find 4K titles on Hulu, Amazon Prime, and other services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Does Apple TV 4K support Dolby Atmos surround sound?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple TV can support Dolby Atmos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are there any other differences between models?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple+TV+4K+Teardown/97511&amp;xcust=1-1-230347-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iFixit’s customary teardown</a>, it found the two models to be extremely similar but there are a couple minor differences. For one, the power supply in the 4K model is rated for 12V at 1.083A and the non-4K model is 12V at 0.917A. Additionally, there’s a new user-replaceable fan on the 4K model with eight exhaust ports.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why does the Siri Remote have a Lightning port?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lightning port on the Siri Remote is for charging. Depending on how often you use it, you shouldn’t have to plug it in more often than once every few months. To check the battery level, head over to Remotes and Devices inside the Settings app, select Bluetooth, and you’ll see a battery indicator next to Remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-2021.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n</div>","author":"Macworld Staff","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"314985bdbae039494c9e53499ddedd12234c226d32d39d5d847c7c13523090e9","category":"Apple"}
