The stock's steady increase over the last months comes as the company prepares to announce its quarterly earnings after the market closed Wednesday evening. Shareholders, meanwhile, officially elected Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen as chairman of the board.</p>\n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, GameStop stock is trading at around $325 per share, up nearly 10 percent from a Tuesday closing price of $300. That number is off slightly from the stock's all-time high closing price of $347.51 on January 27 (though the stock spiked very briefly at an all-time high of $483 in intra-day trading on January 28). Today's close could easily approach or surpass the January 29 closing price of $325, which was the stock's second-highest in history.</p>\n<p>After the historic highs of January, GameStop stock plummeted to under $60 per share by the time February rolled around, and it sank as low as $40.59 by February 19, just after it was a central subject in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/robinhood-says-gamestop-volatility-was-a-1-in-3-5-million-black-swan/\">a House Committee on Financial Services hearing</a>. By early March, though, enthusiastic retail investors had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/dont-look-now-but-gamestops-stock-price-is-surging-again/\">once again bid the price up</a> to around $260, after which it slowly sank back down to a recent minimum of $143.20 just a month ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771837#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771837&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"50bf7c77bb75e2e1aa6a41a65d17789b310bd47b469a0c56291b2f2f37102870","category":"Tech"}
