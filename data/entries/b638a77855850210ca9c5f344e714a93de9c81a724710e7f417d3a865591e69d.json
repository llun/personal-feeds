{"title":"The Battle for the 2021 Giro d'Italia: Taking Stock of the GC","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-gc-battle-begins","date":1620770475000,"content":"\n      <p>The battle for the 104th Giro d’Italia is still in its early stages. However, the Colle Passerino on stage 4 was the scene for the first jabs between the GC contenders in the mountains. This, after the foundations were laid in the Turin time trial last Saturday.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The GC battle is still only taking shape and, to quote a cliché, you can't win the Giro in the first week, only lose it. Some have completely lost touch, and although the gaps remain slim, let's take stock and analyse the fight for pink.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>INEOS Grenadiers</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20200831TDF1012-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet_1024x1024.jpg?v=1620765193\" /></strong><em>Image credit: </em><em>ASO/Pauline Ballet/SWPix</em></p>\n<p><span>11. Bernal +1:39<br /></span><span>22. Sivakov +2:08<br /></span><span>23. Martinez +2:10</span></p>\n<p><span>Egan Bernal’s bad back was the subject of much discussion prior to the race and still is — it’s what caused him major issues at last season’s Tour de France. However the Colombian was 40th in the opening time-trial in Turin and flew up the Colle delle Passerino — the relative ease with which he closed the gap to the attackers will be unnerving to rivals. Pavel Sivakov and Dani Martinez, the INEOS back-up options weren’t among the best climbers, but that shouldn’t matter. INEOS should be all in for Bernal, and the former Tour de France champ looks back to his best.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Team BikeExchange</strong></h4>\n<p><span>16. Yates +1:49</span></p>\n<p><span>Simon Yates entered the Giro as one of the very top favourites. He was dominant at the Tour of the Alps where he beat some of his competitors here, namely Hugh Carthy and Alexandr Vlasov. He couldn’t hold the wheel of either en route to Sestola, though. Far from disastrous, the Brit will enjoy the higher mountains which come later on. We all remember his collapse in 2018 where he was overzealous too early in the race. He won't want to make the same mistake this year.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Bahrain-Victorious</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW3_7967_1024x1024.jpg?v=1620764433\" /></strong><em>Image credit: Alex Whitehead/SWpix</em></p>\n<p><span><span>12. Caruso +1:43</span><br />15. Landa +1:49</span><span><br /></span><span>24. Bilbao +2:21</span></p>\n<p><span>Something always seems to hold Mikel Landa back at the Grand Tours: whether it’s getting caught out in echelons or losing time in a time-trial. That hasn’t happened yet for Landa and the Spaniard was confident heading to Sestola. So much so, he put his Rafa Valls and later Pello Bilbao on the front before attacking early, finishing among the best of the GC protagonists. Notably, Bilbao and Damiano Caruso also kept themselves well within contention. Landa may never have entered a Grand Tour with such strength in the mountains built around him. Is this his best shot at Grand Tour victory yet?</span></p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>Astana Premier-Tech</strong></h4>\n<p>7. Vlasov +1:24</p>\n<p>One of the men in form in 2021, Alexandr Vlasov was second at Paris-Nice and then finished on the podium at the Tour of the Alps. Despite his impressive results this year, Vlasov hasn't won since the Giro dell'Emilia last season. The Russian continued his impressive climbing form on the climb to Sestola and following his exceptional 11th-place in the Turin TT he now sits ahead of all his rivals in the general classification. Alessandro De Marchi holds the <em>maglia rosa</em>, but once he and the rest of stage four's breakaway drop away as they inevitably will, Vlasov has placed himself in the prime position to move into pink.</p>\n<h4><strong>EF Education-NIPPO</strong></h4>\n<p>10. Carthy +1:38</p>\n<p>EF Education-NIPPO are another team that are based around one leader: Hugh Carthy. He may have gone under the radar somewhat entering the race, though, particularly when you remember his strong podium at La Vuelta last season. The signs in favour of Carthy remain strong after he followed the strongest riders to Sestola and he finished 35th in the Turin TT. Carthy has shown strength on the steepest climbs before now, never more so than when he won on the Angliru at last year's Vuelta. He'll look to the Monte Zoncolan and the Sega di Ala with glee. Carthy cannot be underestimated.</p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>Jumbo-Visma</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1232763816_1024x1024.jpg?v=1620765006\" /></strong><em>Image credits: Getty Images</em></p>\n<p><span>31. Foss +2:42<br /></span><span>34. Bennett +3:10</span></p>\n<p>As strange as it may seem in this era where Jumbo-Visma have become one of the most menacing Grand Tour contenders, they entered the 2021 Giro d'Italia as relative outsiders. George Bennett would have his chance to lead a Grand Tour again, whereas the development of Tobias Foss would be tested. Foss started the race brilliantly where he finished third on the TT bike, but he and Bennett both lost major ground in Sestola. The Jumbo-Visma duo finished 1:30 down on the best GC favourites, not a good sign ahead of the bigger mountains to come. Perhaps too early to turn their attention purely to stage wins, but it may be their best option if they lose further ground ahead of the first rest day.</p>\n<h4><strong>Deceuninck Quick-Step </strong></h4>\n<p><span>8. Evenepoel +1:28<br /></span><span>32. Masnada +2:52<br />42. Almeida +5:38</span></p>\n<p><span>One of the big strengths of Deceuninck Quick-Step’s team entering the Giro d’Italia was their strength in depth, particularly in the GC. The returning Remco Evenepoel would join last year’s phenomenon, Joao Almeida, and Fausto Masnada, who claimed an impressive podium at the Tour de Romandie just a fortnight ago, to form a fabulous trident. However, the Colle Passerino did not treat the Belgian side particularly well. Almeida struggled from the foot of the climb and swiftly dropped away — the Portuguese was over four minutes behind Remco and is essentially already out of contention. Deceuninck must now focus on Evenepoel who is racing for the first time in over eight months, though this may have been their plan all along.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Trek-Segafredo</strong></h4>\n<p><span>18. Ciccone +1:56<br /></span><span>25. Nibali +2:15<br />72. Mollema +13:59</span></p>\n<p><span>Trek-Segafredo are one of the teams with the most unknowns but their plans are starting to take shape. Bauke Mollema, who finished fifth at the Giro not too long ago, stated before the race that he plans on hunting stage wins. He's now placed perfectly to do so after losing time en route to Sestola. Vincenzo Nibali fractured his wrist weeks before the departure in Turin, but seems to be in fairly good shape and is still among the GC battle. However, despite his massive time loss in the Turin TT, Giulio Ciccone is at his attacking best. He was first in the leading group to launch ahead on the Colle Passerino and was one of the first five to finish. The Italian attacked on stage three too and although that came to nothing, it is clear that Ciccone is in sublime shape. He will lose time in the final TT to Milan, the only major downside to his GC chances.</span></p>\n<p><em>Cover image: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images</em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"b638a77855850210ca9c5f344e714a93de9c81a724710e7f417d3a865591e69d","category":"Cycling"}
