Bernal<br /><span>11. Martinez +1:12</span><br /></span><span>Sivakov DNF</span></p>\n<p>The Ineos Grenadiers have grappled control of the Giro d’Italia ahead of the first rest day. The British outfit lost Pavel Sivakov to a crash early on, but Egan Bernal is back at the front of a Grand Tour for the first time since the 2019 Tour de France. Bernal looked to close gaps with ease on the San Giacomo and Sestola climbs where he finished at the head of the GC bunch. However, his most impressive moment yet came on the stage 9 gravelled ski slope. After a sprint-like lead-out from Gianni Moscon, Bernal launched his assault on the finish line, dropping all of his GC rivals for the first time and launching himself into the <em>maglia rosa</em>. This was also Bernal’s first stage win at a Grand Tour. With Dani Martinez far from out of contention and Gianni Moscon, Jonathan Castroviejo and Filippo Ganna his lead lieutenants, Egan Bernal is the current favourite to win the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n<p><strong>Team DSM</strong></p>\n<p>13. Bardet +1:21<br />22. Hindley +4:28 </p>\n<p>Under the name Sunweb, Team DSM had two riders on the final podium at the Giro last year. One of them was Jai Hindley, who also led the race heading into the final time-trial. However, Hindley has struggled throughout on terrain that suits him. Team DSM will now focus on their new signing Romain Bardet. The Frenchman is riding his first Giro d’Italia but he is yet to lose a large chunk of time. Similar to Ciccone, Bardet needs to be offensive before the final day in Milan.</p>\n<h4><strong>Trek-Segafredo</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/e9d4b811254ed0429650750b615c8c12_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621282167\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em>Image credit: Andrea Mancini/NurPhoto via Getty Images</em></p>\n<p><span>4. Ciccone +0:37<br /></span><span>16. Nibali +2:13<br /></span><span><br /></span>Like Deceuninck, we weren’t certain who would ride for a GC place for Trek-Segafredo. Mollema expectedly fell away to hunt stage victories and Vincenzo Nibali still doesn’t look back to full fitness after recovering from a fractured wrist just in time to start. However, Giulio Ciccone has taken the race by the scruff of the neck and has been one of the best climbers thus far. He was second to Bernal in Campo Felice and followed the Colombian at both of the other selective mountain-top finishes. Ciccone will lose time en-masse in the time trial to Milan, but may have the climbing legs to make up for that. He needs to be offensive in the mountains to come, and that is something he is far from adverse to.</p>\n<h4><strong>Deceuninck Quick-Step </strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00033119-023_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621282056\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em><span>Image credit: CorVos/SWpix</span></em></p>\n<p><span>2. Evenepoel +0:14</span><span><br />23. Almeida +4:56<br /><span>24. Masnada +6:01</span><br /></span></p>\n<p>Deceuninck Quick-Step entered with numerous battle weapons, but now are left with just one. Almeida and Masnada swiftly faded after news that the former would leave the team at the end of the season. That may not matter, though, as Remco Evenepoel sits in second, tantalisingly close to the<span> </span><em>maglia rosa</em>. Although Evenepoel was unable to follow Bernal on the gravelled climb to Campo Felice, his return to racing has been phenomenal. Let’s remember, Evenepoel hadn’t raced for over eight months prior to the departure in Turin. The biggest tests still await him and we can’t be sure how his body will react to a three-week race, but Evenepoel is the real deal and has already made those who doubted him blush.</p>\n<h4><strong>Bora-Hansgrohe</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/083fb8f268cc060ceda3516821c28eb1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621283044\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em>Image credit: LUCA BETTINI/AFP via Getty Images</em></p>\n<p>15. Buchmann +1:47</p>\n<p>Bora-Hansgrohe enter the first rest day with their stage win in the bag. It was a Bora masterclass which pushed many of the pure sprinters out the back before Peter Sagan sprinted to victory in Foligno. They still have a GC race to ride, though, and work to be done — Emanuel Buchmann has lost time in drabs since departing Turin. However, the German is more suitably equipped to the longer, high mountains where he rode so well at the Tour de France in 2019 on his way to fourth overall. He may be two minutes down, but Buchmann shouldn’t be overlooked just yet.</p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>Bahrain-Victorious</strong></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CORVOS_00033119-080_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621282240\" />Image credit: <span>Miwa iijima/CorVos/SWPix</span></em></p>\n<p><span><span>7. Caruso +0:46</span><br />21. Bilbao +3:27</span><span><br /></span>Landa DNF</p>\n<p>Bahrain-Victorious were dealt a cruel blow when their GC leader Mikel Landa crashed out of the race on the flat stage 5. Landa had looked in supreme form just the day prior in Sestola. However, the team have risen to the challenge since their Spanish leader departed. Gino Mäder won the following stage which finished on the San Giacomo, and Damiano Caruso has settled into the GC-leading role. Caruso sits in the top-10 and has not shied away from being offensive. They have been severely weakened since the start of the race — Matej Mohoric has joined Landa on the sidelines after crashing out — but if we’ve learnt one thing about Bahrain-Victorious it is that they cannot be counted out of the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>Astana Premier-Tech</strong></h4>\n<p>3. Vlasov +0:22</p>\n<p>One of the men in form in 2021, Alexandr Vlasov was second at Paris-Nice and then finished on the podium at the Tour of the Alps. Alex Vlasov was one of the surprise packages in Turin’s opening time-trial where he finished 11th. Since, the Russian has gone about his business quietly and shrewdly, which sees him now sit third. He showed that he’s not against the gravel roads when he was third to Campo Felice, this is a great sign ahead of stage 11 which features 40km of gravel. Maybe going under the radar, Astana have protected their leader’s position well so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Groupama-FDJ</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/CorVos-SWpix.com1808_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621282314\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em>Image credit:<span> </span><span>Miwa iijima/CorVos/SWPix</span></em></p>\n<p>5. Valter +0:44 </p>\n<p>Attila Valter is one of the breakout stars of the Giro d’Italia thus far. The Hungarian rider fought his way into the <em>maglia rosa</em> on stage 5 where he finished amid the prime GC protagonists. He was rewarded with three days in pink before he lost the jersey on the gravelled slopes featured on stage 9. However, Valter still is in the top-5 overall and could be in a position to challenge for a top-10 overall if he can consistently find the form which helped him into pink.</p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>Jumbo-Visma</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1232763816_1024x1024.jpg?v=1620765006\" /></strong><em>Image credits: Getty Images</em></p>\n<p><span>18. Foss +2:23<br /></span><span>29. Bennett +10:34</span></p>\n<p>George Bennett entered the Giro d’Italia as Jumbo-Visma’s GC leader, a rare opportunity given the presence of Primoz Roglic, Steven Kruijswijk and the returning Tom Dumoulin on their roster. However, the Kiwi failed to follow the main contenders and decided to lose time to chase a stage win in the breakaway. A stage win would remain a great outcome for Bennett, who only has one WorldTour win to date in his career. Jumbo-Visma’s GC ambitions now lie solely on the young shoulders of Tobias Foss. The Norwegian still has 30km of time-trialing to look forward to where he’ll surely jump up the standings, can he cling on in the mountains, though?</p>\n<h4><strong>Team BikeExchange</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01ad4086b01e7df22176705deab1616c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621282903\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em>Image credit: Tim de Waele/Getty Images</em></p>\n<p><span>9. Yates +0:56</span></p>\n<p>The pre-race favourite. Simon Yates has gone from one of the most talked about GC contenders at the Giro d’Italia to one of the least across the previous ten days of racing, yet he is still just 56 seconds down. The Brit entered the Giro following a convincing victory at the Tour of the Alps. He is yet to show-off those legs, but the big mountains are still to come. Yates lost the Giro d’Italia in 2018 after being overly aggressive too early in the race and isn’t making that mistake again this year. </p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<p><em>Cover image: <span>Dario Belingheri/LB/RB/Cor Vos</span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"b638a77855850210ca9c5f344e714a93de9c81a724710e7f417d3a865591e69d","category":"Cycling"}
