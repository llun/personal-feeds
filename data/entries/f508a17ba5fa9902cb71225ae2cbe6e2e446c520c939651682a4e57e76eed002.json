The once-abandoned power plant was bought by private equity firm Atlas Holdings and retasked. A significant portion of Greenidge's electricity no longer powers nearby homes or businesses; rather, the plant's smokestacks are increasingly pouring pollutants into the atmosphere in the service of mining bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Now, Greenidge is on the verge of ramping up its bitcoin ambitions. By the end of this year, it plans to have 18,000 specialized machines mining bitcoin, and with the <a href=\"https://www.weny.com/story/43703733/a-win-for-industry-town-of-torrey-votes-in-favor-of-greenidge-generation-proposal\">recent approval</a> of its data center expansion plans, it will add <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001844971/000119312521149057/d166032ds4.htm\">10,500 more</a>.
