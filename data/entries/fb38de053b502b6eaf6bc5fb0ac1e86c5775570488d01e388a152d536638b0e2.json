While it's easy to find deals on bikes for under $1,000, it's also possible to spend over $10,000 on a high-end road bike. Electric bikes, while not quite as extreme, have a broad spread. At the low end, they're pretty much commoditized, with lots of companies offering similar options that provide basic e-bike functionality. The differentiation really happens at the high end, where prices can easily clear $5,000.</p>\n<p>We recently got a chance to test-ride a new offering from a new company called <a href=\"https://civilizedcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Civilized Cycles</a> based in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Its launch model, intended for availability late this year, aims squarely at the high end, with plenty of carefully thought-out features and a clear sense of design. You get quite a bit that's not available from commoditized alternatives, but the price for the extras is going to be $5,500.</p>\n<h2>Getting civilized</h2>\n<p>Ars met with Civilized Cycles founder Zach Schieffelin in the Navy Yard. That's when we talked about what informed the Model 1's design, which ranged from his own experience as a cyclist to his ownership of a Vespa scooter dealership. Overall, that's led to an e-bike that's positioned somewhere between the two.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775207#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775207&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb38de053b502b6eaf6bc5fb0ac1e86c5775570488d01e388a152d536638b0e2","category":"Tech"}
