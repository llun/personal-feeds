The state law is preempted by federal law, US District Judge Denis Hurley wrote in the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.463483/gov.uscourts.nyed.463483.25.0_1.pdf\">order</a>. While the case will continue, Hurley found that the industry is likely to succeed in its lawsuit.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Broadband Act (ABA) would require ISPs to offer \"all qualifying low-income households at least two Internet access plans: (i) download speeds of at least 25 megabits-per-second at no more than $15-per-month, or (ii) download speeds of at least 200 megabits-per-second at no more than $20-per-month,\" the ruling noted. The low-income qualifications specified by the law cover about 7 million New Yorkers in 2.7 million households, over one-third of all households in the state. The <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.463483/gov.uscourts.nyed.463483.1.3.pdf\">law</a> allows exceptions to the minimum-speed requirement \"where such download speed is not reasonably practicable.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772604#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772604&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c7cfac5fbe0fee5b3608838001d410950f7743e506f64bc95819ce3e3cf2b13","category":"Tech"}
