From now on, undiluted vials of the mRNA vaccine can stay at normal refrigerator temperatures for up to a month rather than the previous limit of just five days.</p>\n<p>The change has the potential to significantly ease storage issues and promote the use of the highly effective vaccine, which has been hindered in some settings by its ultra-cold storage requirements.</p>\n<p>For long-term storage, the vaccine still requires ultra-cold freezer temperatures—between -80°C to -60°C (-112°F to -76°F). But the vials can be transported and temporarily stored at normal freezer temperatures—between -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F)—for up to two weeks. According to yesterday’s update, the undiluted vials can then be thawed and kept at normal refrigerator temperatures—between 2°C to 8°C (35°F to 46°F)—for up to a month. Once the vials are diluted and ready for use, they must be used within six hours, according to the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download\">FDA’s detailed handling guide</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766329#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766329&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6d4e072175d82fa6a1a0d2541d8cb9879e77f9c8bf350cb9032ff9809be424eb","category":"Tech"}
