It has quite bit of new footage and some small additional details (such as why Idris Elba's Bloodsport is in prison in the first place). Each of the three trailers released so far has been better than the last, so we have high hopes for this film.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/harley-quinn-has-new-bad-guy-allies-in-the-suicide-squad-red-band-trailer/\">I've written previously</a>, <em>The Suicide Squad</em> is not a direct sequel to the 2016 film; Gunn has said he wanted to take the franchise in a new direction and introduce new characters. He drew inspiration from writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ostrander\">John Ostrander</a>'s original 1980s <em>Suicide Squad</em> comics. (Ostrander has a small role in the final film.) Gunn <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-introduces-the-full-roster-of-bad-guys-james-gunn-is-bringing-to-theaters-dc-fandome/\">has described</a> his R-rated film as a superhero version of the classic 1967 film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen\"><em>The Dirty Dozen</em></a>, selecting characters he described as \"loser, B-grade supervillains.\" </p>\n<p>Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis reprise their 2016 roles as Col. Rick Flag and Intelligence Officer Amanda Waller, respectively, with Steve Agee playing John Economos, prison warden and aide to Waller. The squad this time around includes Elba's Bloodsport, Peacemaker (John Cena), Courtney's Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), King Shark (voiced by Rooker's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger_(film)\"><em>Cliffhanger</em></a> co-star Sylvester Stallone), Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Javelin (Flula Borg), and everyone's favorite psycho, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775366#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775366&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d2c1a1676dd446ffc2db272a7c0c17b0ddf6e1815ea766c5d38d05b65aea2d6c","category":"Tech"}
