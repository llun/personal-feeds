The A15 Bionic chip will continue to be based on the smaller process but instead use an enhanced version, which presumably will enable improved performance and improved power efficiency to match. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌iPhone 13‌ is expected to be announced as early as September, in line with previous years, following the delayed launch of the ‌iPhone 12‌ due to the global health crisis. As lockdowns emerged last year, Apple and its suppliers had to cut back on production, forcing the annual release of the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to take place in October, one month later than usual. However, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes that a similar situation is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/12/kuo-expects-iphone-13-mass-production-on-time/\">unlikely to happen again this year</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlongside the faster performance, graphics, and improved power efficiency thanks to the A15 Bionic chip, the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup is rumored to include several other new features. The higher-end models of the lineup, the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max, are expected to include an LTPO display, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">would enable a higher 120Hz refresh rate</a>. The inclusion of LTPO displays also opens the door for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">possibility of having an always-on display</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/a15-bionic-chip-reportedly-begins-for-iphone-13/\">Apple Supplier TSMC Reportedly Begins Production of A15 Bionic Chip for iPhone 13</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-tsmc-reportedly-begins-production-of-a15-bionic-chip-for-iphone-13.2297858/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=s5JUBe98I_s:XLmTU4xxIiQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=s5JUBe98I_s:XLmTU4xxIiQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/s5JUBe98I_s\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b3389e64596300a404277ff89f930572f42f7941dffb08cfd1506291cdf52e6e","category":"Apple"}
