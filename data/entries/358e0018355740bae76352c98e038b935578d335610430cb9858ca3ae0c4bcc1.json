The inner rim width has been increased from 17mm to 19mm to fit 25mm tyres, with a rim profile that has been lightened and CNC machined to allow for that change in shape.</p>\n<p>These changes, Fulcrum says, mean the Racing 4 DB wheels are great for climbing while they don't lose stability on fast descents.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9699/fulcrum-updated-racing-4-5-and-6-db-wheels-images#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 36</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/2022-racing_action_00001.jpg?itok=PjBUa_ch\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>36</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>The endurance-primed Racing 5 DBs and versatile Racing 6 DBs have gone through a similar update, going one step further to take on 20mm inner rim widths meaning 28mm tyres will fit comfortably.</p>\n<p>There are also lower profiles all round as the 5's new lower 24mm U-shaped profile, while decreasing aerodynamics and stiffness, helps to improve comfort and save energy, it's also the lightest of the bunch – Fulcrum says it weighs in at 1,660g.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/57/fulcrum-racing-3-review\">Fulcrum Racing 3 review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/1178/buyers-guide-wheel-upgrades\">Best road bike wheels upgrades under £500</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/9498/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto\">Bora Ultra WTO: Campagnolo launches the latest and greatest in its iconic line of race wheels </a></div>    </div></div><p>\nMeanwhile the 6 also drops from 26mm to 24mm, but as the range's true entry-level model weighs the most, coming in at a claimed 1,780g.</p>\n<p>All three models have Fulcrum's 2-Way Fit technology allowing for tubeless or clincher tyres to be fitted and the 4 and 5 have laser-etched graphics that ensure longlasting aesthetics.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9699/fulcrum-updated-racing-4-5-and-6-db-wheels-images#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 36</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/2022-racing_action_00002.jpg?itok=qp682_JL\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>36</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>The updates and prices</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Racing 4 DB</td>\n<td>Racing 5 DB</td>\n<td>Racing 6 DB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rim</td>\n<td>Inner width: 19mm, Height: 34mm;
