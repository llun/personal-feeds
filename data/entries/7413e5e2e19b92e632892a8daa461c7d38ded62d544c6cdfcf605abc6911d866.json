{"title":"Arizona Lawsuit Documents Detail Google’s Efforts to Collect User Location Data and Obfuscate the Settings to Control It","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5","date":1622412831000,"content":"\n<p>Tyler Sonnemaker, reporting for Insider:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Newly unredacted documents in a lawsuit against Google reveal that\nthe company’s own executives and engineers knew just how difficult\nthe company had made it for smartphone users to keep their\nlocation data private.</p>\n\n<p>Google continued collecting location data even when users turned\noff various location-sharing settings, made popular privacy\nsettings harder to find, and even pressured LG and other phone\nmakers into hiding settings precisely because users liked them,\n<a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/media/interest/updated-redacted-google-complaint\">according to the documents</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Menzel, a former vice president overseeing Google Maps,\nadmitted during a deposition that the only way Google wouldn’t be\nable to figure out a user’s home and work locations is if that\nperson intentionally threw Google off the trail by setting their\nhome and work addresses as some other random locations. […]</p>\n\n<p>When Google tested versions of its Android operating system that\nmade privacy settings easier to find, users took advantage of\nthem, which Google viewed as a “problem”, according to the\ndocuments. To solve that problem, Google then sought to bury those\nsettings deeper within the settings menu.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Arizona attorney general Mark Brnovich’s <a href=\"https://www.azag.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/Complaint%20%28redacted%29.pdf\">complaint</a> (PDF), albeit partially redacted, is a cogent and damning read. It seems undeniable that Google deliberately obfuscated location privacy settings, and knew that they were confusing. From pages 12–13:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google’s own employees have clearly identified the problem:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“Real people just think in terms of ‘location is on’, ‘location\nis off’ because that’s exactly what you have on the front screen\nof your phone.” Ex. 206 (GOOG-GLAZ-00055452) at 452.</li>\n<li>“The current UI feels like it is designed to make things\npossible, yet difficult enough that people won’t figure it out.”\nEx. 207 (GOOG-GLAZ-00077898) at 899.</li>\n<li>“Some people (including even Googlers) don’t know that there is\na global switch and a per-device switch.” Ex. 208\n(GOOG-GLAZ-00055552) at 553.</li>\n<li>“Today, collection of device usage and diagnostic data is\nsmeared across 5 settings resulting in conditions that are\ndifficult for Googlers, let alone users, to understand.” Ex. 210\n(GOOG-GLAZ-00057940) at 940.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I enjoy the implicit assumption in their internal communications that Google employees are so smart that if “even” they’re confused, it must be too complicated. From page 15 (citations omitted for readability):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On August 13, 2018, the AP published an exclusive report titled\n“<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb\">Google tracks your movements, like it or not</a>” that publicly\nexposed this deception.3 The article explained how Google “records\nyour movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.”</p>\n\n<p>Until the AP article was published, Google represented on its\npublic help page regarding Location History that “You can turn off\nLocation History at any time. With Location History off, the\nplaces you go are no longer stored.”</p>\n\n<p>But that was not true. Even with Location History off, Google\nstill collected and stored location data via (at least) its Web &amp;\nApp Activity setting. Thus, for example, a user who had Location\nHistory off and looked up the weather where he lived or searched\nthe web with Google’s Search app would still unknowingly send\nGoogle his location.</p>\n\n<p>The day the AP story was published, Google turned into crisis mode\nand held a self-styled “Oh Shit” meeting in reaction to the story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Oh shit” indeed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/30/arizona-google-location-data\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7413e5e2e19b92e632892a8daa461c7d38ded62d544c6cdfcf605abc6911d866","category":"Tech"}
