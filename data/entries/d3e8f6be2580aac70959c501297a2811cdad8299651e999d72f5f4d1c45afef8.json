To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery, it needs to be placed on a charger, and it needs to be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌‌‌‌‌‌‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPaired with iOS 14.5, watchOS 7.4 brings a new \"Unlock with Apple Watch\" feature that lets an ‌iPhone‌ with Face ID use an unlocked and authenticated Apple Watch as a secondary authentication measure when you're wearing a mask, alleviating the need to enter a passcode to unlock the ‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iphone-apple-watch-unlock.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause Face ID does not work when wearing a mask, it can be a hassle to use an ‌iPhone‌ with a mask on. The new Apple Watch feature provides an easy but still secure way to access the ‌iPhone‌ without hassling with a passcode. It's almost identical to unlocking on Mac and can be enabled in the Settings app under Face ID &amp; Passcode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn unlocked Apple Watch paired with Face ID can unlock the ‌iPhone‌ when a mask is worn, but the entire face cannot be covered and the eyes still need to be visible. Apple Watch mask authentication can't be used for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases, nor can it be used to unlock apps that require a Face ID scan. In these situations, the mask will need to be removed or a passcode/password will need to be used instead.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iphone-apple-watch-unlock-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the Apple Watch unlocks the ‌iPhone‌, you'll feel a haptic tap on the wrist and will receive a notification on the watch to let you know when your ‌iPhone‌ has been unlocked, similar to how it works when using the watch to unlock a Mac. There is a proximity feature as well, to ensure that you must be near your ‌iPhone‌ for it to unlock with the Apple Watch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor Apple Fitness+ users, the watchOS 7.4 update enables <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> 2 for Apple Fitness+, so workouts can be streamed to an ‌AirPlay‌ 2-enabled TV or set-top box. Apple Watch metrics do not show up on the screen when AirPlayed, however, and that feature is limited to ‌iPhone‌/<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>/<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nwatchOS 7.4 introduces an option to choose a Bluetooth device type in settings to correctly identify audio notifications, and it introduces ECG support and irregular heart rhythm notifications in Australia and Vietnam. Apple's full release notes with additional features are listed below:<blockquote>watchOS 7.4 includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n- Ability to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ X and later with Apple Watch when you attempt to use Face ID while wearing a face mask\r\n<br />\r\n- Option to classify Bluetooth device type in Settings for correct identification of headphones for audio notifications\r\n<br />\r\n- Ability to stream audio and video content from Apple Fitness+ workouts to ‌AirPlay‌ 2-enabled TVs and devices\r\n<br />\r\n- Support for the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 or later in Australia and Vietnam\r\n<br />\r\n- Support for irregular heart rhythm notifications in Australia and Vietnam</blockquote>More information on the ‌watchOS 7‌ operating system that runs on modern Apple Watch models can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">found in our watchOS 7 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-releases-watchos-7-4/\">Apple Releases watchOS 7.4 With iPhone Unlocking, Apple Fitness+ AirPlay 2 Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-watchos-7-4-with-iphone-unlocking-apple-fitness-airplay-2-support.2293341/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HscLnNaumOc:dJqaj4r3aTU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HscLnNaumOc:dJqaj4r3aTU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HscLnNaumOc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d3e8f6be2580aac70959c501297a2811cdad8299651e999d72f5f4d1c45afef8","category":"Apple"}
