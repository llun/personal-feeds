It will also mean a second postponement of the long-awaited inaugural edition of the women's race.</p>\n<p>The question now is when we can expect a definitive decision and whether, if cancelled, the Hell of the North will be able to be held later in the year. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"31c00f1bd7dc443573751aebee20adcf15ea6f7e79603e41159c9f07a377047d","category":"Cycling"}
