They were looking for something to replace her aging, skinny-tire&#8217;d road bike so that she could more comfortably participate in gravel and mixed terrain rides both by herself and with her riding club. She also wanted to make sure it could handle a bit of luggage for overnight, sport touring trips where minimal gear is needed while going between BnBs or hotels. The Low Kicker Polyvalent was a natural selection for the frameset. Needless to say, this sounded like it was going to be a very fun bike for Melissa and a very fun project for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This project has some special details, so head to <a href=\"https://velo-orange.blogspot.com/2021/02/melissas-sport-touring-low-kicker-has.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Velo Orange</a> to see the full spread!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"3e0b0712094ccfe131b6f04bc7457ce79ac14e2df8a882e6807ac49f001d4920","category":"Cycling"}
