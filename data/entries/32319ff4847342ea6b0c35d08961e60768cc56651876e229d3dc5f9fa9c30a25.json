The race's organiser was forced to rethink the end of this year's race after Nice went into lockdown, with local authorities wanting to leave the Promenade des Anglais open for locals to exercise.Â </p>\n<p>It's the second time the race has been forced to change after last year's edition had to be shortened to seven stages.</p>\n<p>Stage 7, on Saturday 13th March, will still conclude with the summit finish at Valdeblore la Colmiane but the start has been moved to Le Broc, just north of Nice. It has also been shortened to 119.2km.</p>\n<div id=\"file-43990\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/03/paris_nice_stage_7.jpeg?itok=wpSRn6ly\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Stage 8, on Sunday 14th March, will loop around the area around Nice, starting at Le Plan Du Var and finishing in Levens.
