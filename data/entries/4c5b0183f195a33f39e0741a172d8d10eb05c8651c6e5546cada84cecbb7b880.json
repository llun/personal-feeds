These are the best gravel bike shoes of 2021, as rated by our expert testers.</p>\n<h2>Gravel-specific shoes, are they really necessary?</h2>\n<p>The natural crossover between the riding conditions and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-pedals-13-of-our-favourites/\">pedal systems</a> used in cross-country mountain biking and gravel riding means that a lot of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-shoes-for-mountain-bikers/\">mountain bike footwear</a> is already well suited to gravel.</p>\n<p>For that reason, you’ll find some of the shoes in this list were originally designed for mountain biking.</p>\n<p>However, the likes of Specialized, Shimano and Fizik are all now producing gravel-specific footwear.</p>\n<p>This new generation of discipline-specific footwear tends to go without the considerable sole, heel and toe protection more commonplace on cross-country shoes, naturally making them lighter. The styling is often – but not always – more casual, too.</p>\n<p>Keep reading to the end for our full gravel shoe buyer’s guide.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">Best gravel bikes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">Best gravel bike tyres</a></li>\n</ul><section><div>\n        <h2>The best gravel bike shoes 2021, in order of score</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Fizik Terra X5</strong>: £150</li>\n<li><strong>Giro Privateer Lace</strong>: £124.99 / $140</li>\n<li><strong>Lake MX176:</strong> £135</li>\n<li><strong>Mavic Crossmax Elite CM</strong>: £160 / €179.95</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano RX8</strong>: £219.99 / $250</li>\n<li><strong>DMT KM1 shoes:</strong> £310</li>\n<li><strong>Giro Sector:</strong> £200</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano XC5</strong>: £120 / $150</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano XC501:</strong> £140</li>\n<li><strong>Sidi Jarin</strong>: £340 / €435</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized S-Works Recon</strong>: £340 / $425</li>\n<li><strong>Triban RC 520</strong>: £70</li>\n<li><strong>Quoc Gran Tourer</strong>:  £219 / $275</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Fizik Terra X5</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even though Fizik cites a mountain bike heritage for the X5, it still feels like a road shoe that has come to the rugged side.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£150 as tested</li>\n<li>Efficient pedalling</li>\n<li>Good fit</li>\n<li>Comfortable on the bike</li>\n</ul><p>The Fizik Terra X5 shoes are rugged enough for off-road exploits and have a balanced and secure fit thanks to a wide tongue and an asymmetric Boa dial.</p>\n<p>The shoes have carbon soles with deep treads and TPU-injected studs. This makes for a pair of stiff shoes that shed mud well, but when walking they lack flex and do feel like beefy road shoes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this does mean that when it comes to climbing the Terra X5s put more power through the pedals than some other gravel shoes. So if you’re riding doesn’t require you to hike-a-bike that often, these will likely be a good choice.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/fizik-terra-x5-shoe-review/\">Read our full review of the Fizik Terra X5 shoes</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Giro Privateer Lace</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Giro’s Privateer Lace shoes look great.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£124.99 / $140 as tested</li>\n<li>Comfortable yet efficient</li>\n<li>Generous sizing</li>\n<li>Great looking shoes</li>\n</ul><p>Originally designed for mountain biking but also great for gravel riding are the Privateer Lace shoes from Giro.</p>\n<p>They’re comfortable, with a sole that provides a good compromise between efficiency and comfort.

bike shoes</h2>\n<p>The best gravel shoes depend very much on how you interpret ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/gravel/\">gravel</a>’.</p>\n<p>For some of us,  gravel is simply a jaunt down a few green lanes, while others regard gravel as anything that mixes tarmac and dirt in one ride – even if that dirt calls for what are effectively mountain bike skills but on drop bars.</p>\n<p>Location is often a factor too. In the UK, ‘gravel’ is more likely to mean country lanes and bridleways compared to in the USA where the well-maintained gravel roads of races like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/unbound-2021-bikes/\">Unbound</a> are more commonplace.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The line between gravel shoes and cross-country mountain bike shoes is often thin.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>But however you choose to define gravel riding, it is more likely than not that your gravel shoes will need to balance stiffness and efficient power transfer with comfort for longer rides and walkability for rugged terrain or off-the-bike use.</p>\n<p>So just like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a>, the best gravel bike shoes often feel subtly different to kit designed specifically for other riding disciplines.</p>\n<p>Compared to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">road shoes</a>, gravel shoes are designed for walking comfort and are a bit more forgiving. They also differ from many road shoes as they use two-bolt mountain bike style cleats as opposed to three-bolt road cleats.</p>\n<p>At the other extreme, flat-soled <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-shoes-for-mountain-bikers/\">mountain bike shoes</a> might have off-bike comfort but their flexible soles aren’t the best for power transfer.</p>\n<p>Performance XC (cross-country) mountain bike shoes make for the closest match, which is why we’re seeing some styles badged as mountain bike and gravel hybrids. In fact, the difference between the two is often so small it might as well be non-existent and either will work fine for the other.</p>\n<h3>Five things to consider when looking for gravel shoes</h3>\n<p>The best place, as with everything bike related, is to start by considering your own skills, fitness and preferred riding in order to understand whether you might want to trade off some walking ease for stiffness or if comfort still means everything.</p>\n<p>But, in general, there are five main things to consider when looking for a pair of gravel shoes:</p>\n<ol><li>Fastening and closure</li>\n<li>The shoe’s uppers</li>\n<li>The sole of the shoe</li>\n<li>Fit</li>\n<li>Insole</li>\n</ol><h3>Fastening and closure</h3>\n<p>Technology has gifted us the Boa dial, which gives a rock-solid fit that’s easy to adjust even when riding, but less room for variation in tension through its length.</p>\n<p>A common combination is a strap over the toe section that allows it to be independently tightened, with a Boa dial or similar over the mid-foot. It’s a construction that generally works well, as long as there’s enough adjustment in the toe strap.</p>\n<p>Old-school laces have their fans, though. If you have a high instep, you probably find that they allow for the differentiation in tension that gives a snug forefoot fit combined with ease over the instep that you need for best comfort.</p>\n<p>The downside of laces is that they have a habit of working loose over the course of a ride especially if walking is involved, which is likely on more technical gravel rides.</p>\n<p>The gold standard is the double Boa, which allows you to independently tighten the forefoot and instep. In our experience, this creates a fit that’s both secure and comfortable, yet stays solid throughout your ride.</p>\n<h3>Uppers</h3>\n<p>We demand a lot of the uppers of any cycling shoes – gravel shoes perhaps more than most.</p>\n<p>Gravel shoe uppers have to help deliver power transfer like road shoe uppers but have to have enough stretch for walking. They also have to be particularly durable and resistant to any scuffs from clambering over rough terrain.</p>\n<p>Synthetic uppers are common across the price spectrum. Often synthetic uppers rely on perforation and mesh inserts for breathability. They don’t mould to the shape of your foot in the same way that leather does, but they don’t cost as much either, and fastening paired with other factors such as insole choice can practically circumvent this issue.</p>\n<p>When trying on gravel shoes, try not to assume initial discomfort will disappear with wear. Check that adjustments don’t cause wrinkles that can rub, the tongue sits smoothly with no pressure points, the collar isn’t so high that it nudges against your ankle bones and that there are no prominent interior seams.</p>\n<h3>Soles</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> One of the main difference between road and gravel shoes is the sole, with gravel shoes having lugs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If we ask a lot of the upper of cycling shoes in general, we expect the impossible of the sole unit of gravel-specific shoes.</p>\n<p>These need to be stiff enough for us to put the power down but flexible enough to walk in, and light enough not to feel uncomfortable but sufficiently stable and grippy to keep us grounded.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll learn if you test a lot of shoes is that simply flexing them between your hands is no indicator of how comfortable the shoe will be to walk in. The second is that fit is more important than how stiff the sole is.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the sole should be rigid through the mid-foot, with the flex being apparent in the toe section past the cleat. If the toe section has some spring, lifting up from instead of being flat on the ground, this will also enable the rolling action of your foot.</p>\n<p>Outsoles made from rubber or TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) add grip and durability, with gravel shoes tending to have a more open lug pattern than the outsoles of off-road shoes. In theory, this provides enough grip while still enabling them to shed mud faster.</p>\n<p>In practice, on rougher terrain an all-over lug pattern is best for stability. The question of whether or not to add studs is a personal one, though for us it’s not crucial unless we’re racing cyclocross, where the extra grip could make or break a race.</p>\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n<p>The fit of a gravel shoe needs to be snug but not tight, comfortable but not loose. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that pulling the fastenings tighter will overcome a shoe that’s slightly too big, or that you can wear in one that’s too tight.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve fastened a gravel shoe you should be able to walk without your heel pulling out.</p>\n<p>Pay particular attention to the shoe’s width as well as its length. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/wide-shoes-why-you-need-them-and-which-brand-makes-the-best/\">Some shoes suit wider feet</a> and, if there’s too much volume, you will not only lose efficiency on the pedalling upstroke but you’ll have less stability walking.</p>\n<h3>Insole</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The insole on the Rapha Explore Powerweave shoe has a swappable arch for a tailored fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>What’s inside a shoe is almost as important as what’s on the outside.</p>\n<p>For many gravel riders in the UK, puddles, water and mud are probably going to feature on rides for a chunk of (most of) the year.</p>\n<p>A sealed footbed is a must-have to prevent water ingress from the cleat holes. Remove the insole, take a look and run your fingers over the surface. The smoother it feels inside the forefoot section, the less chance that you’ll be aware of the cleats.</p>\n<p>In some shoes, insoles feel almost like an afterthought: thin and offering little discernible support. Yet a cushioned insole with a shaped arch adds another degree of comfort and can help you to dial your fit.</p>\n<p>Shoes from some brands, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/rapha/\">Rapha</a>, come with different arch inserts, so you can customise the support you need.
