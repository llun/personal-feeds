The XCSSET malware <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/17/new-xcode-malware-found/\">has been out in the wild</a> since 2020, but Jamf noticed an uptick in recent activity and discovered a new variant.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOnce installed on a victim's system, the malware was used specifically for taking screenshots of the user's desktop with no additional permissions required. Jamf said that it could be used to bypass other permissions as well, as long as the donor application the malware piggybacked off of had that permission enabled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nJamf has a <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/zero-day-tcc-bypass-discovered-in-xcsset-malware/\">full rundown</a> on how the exploit worked, and the company says that Apple addressed the vulnerability in ‌macOS Big Sur‌ 11.4, Apple confirmed to <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/malware-xcsset-macos\">TechCrunch</a></em> that a fix has indeed been enabled in macOS 11.4, so Mac users should update their software as soon as possible.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-big-sur-11-0.226\">macOS Big Sur (11.0)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/macos-big-sur-11-4-malware-screenshots/\">macOS Big Sur 11.4 Addresses Vulnerability That Could Let Attackers Take Secret Screenshots</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-big-sur-11-4-addresses-vulnerability-that-could-let-attackers-take-secret-screenshots.2297665/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3evGi3RYJTw:AIn1rjtyfzU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3evGi3RYJTw:AIn1rjtyfzU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3evGi3RYJTw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0017f3ca3bb89b5ce8e0d9867764b7f5ab3077ef278ce03cf3573349a6e2642b","category":"Apple"}
