{"title":"Sonnet Introduces Thunderbolt 4 Dock With Up to 90W Charging for Macs","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/sonnet-echo-11-thunderbolt-4-dock/","date":1613673618000,"content":"Accessory maker Sonnet today introduced the <a href=\"https://www.sonnettech.com/product/echo11-thunderbolt4-dock/overview.html\">Echo 11 Thunderbolt 4 Dock</a>, which greatly expands a Mac's connectivity options for storage drives, external displays, and more. The dock is equipped with four Thunderbolt 4 ports, four USB-A ports (three 3.2 and one 2.0), one Gigabit Ethernet port, one 3.5mm combo audio jack, and one SD card slot.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/sonnet-thunderbolt-4-dock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784407\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe dock is compatible with all Intel-based and M1-based Macs with Thunderbolt 4/Thunderbolt 3 ports, and provides up to 90W of pass-through charging with a single-cable connection. Depending on the Mac, the dock also supports connecting one external display with up to 8K resolution or up to two external displays with up to 5K resolution.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGiven that Thunderbolt 4 shares the same connector design as USB-C, the dock can also be used with 2018 and newer iPad Pro models, as well as the fourth-generation iPad Air. It can also connect to USB-C external displays.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSonnet says the dock will be available in early April in the United States, priced at &#36;249.99, with international availability to follow in May. For a limited time, customers in the United States and Canada may <a href=\"https://www.sonnettech.com/product/echo11-thunderbolt4-dock/overview.html\">sign up on Sonnet's website</a> to receive a promotion code that will allow them to purchase the dock for &#36;199.99 when it is available.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/owc-thunderbolt-4-dock-and-more/\">OWC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/caldigit-element-hub-thunderbolt-4-dock/\">CalDigit</a> also introduced Thunderbolt 4 docks recently, priced at &#36;249 and &#36;179.99, respectively, so it's worth checking out all three options.
