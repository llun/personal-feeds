The abort was caused by a \"slightly conservative high thrust limit,\" SpaceX founder Elon Musk said afterward. Basically, the onboard flight computer received data from one of the engines that it was producing more thrust than anticipated.</p>\n<p>The good news? This thrust limit can be adjusted upward in the flight software, and the vehicle is now recycling through propellant loading for another attempt. SN10 may still fly later today, time to be determined.</p>\n<p><strong>Original post 8:12 am EST</strong>: SpaceX may launch its third full-scale Starship prototype—named Serial Number 10, or SN10—as early as Wednesday from South Texas.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746342#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746342&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6f79679c43eb6671e2aaaee5b8d561119bfffc3c4a76506022c45409947405e","category":"Tech"}
