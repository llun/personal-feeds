Projects originating on it have gone on to earn virtually every big film accolade, from <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/music/news/guy-clark-documentary-south-by-southwest-townes-van-zandt-1234906729/\">debuts at major festivals</a> to <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/hair-love-and-10-years-of-kickstarter-funded-oscar-nominees\">Oscars.</a> But for every <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832232974/elstree-1976\"><em>Elstree 1976</em></a> or <em><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iambigbird/i-am-big-bird?ref=watch\">I Am Big Bird</a></em>, it feels like Kickstarter offers at least 50 projects that seem a bit too niche, a bit too low-budget, or a bit too amateurish. At the beginning of this very month, you could back a film about the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ziggytrixx/the-life-of-ziggy-trixx?ref=discovery_category\">life of a UK-based, skateboarding Staffordshire Bull Terrier</a> or about <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sergeiboutenko/wild-edibles-a-practical-guide-to-foraging?ref=discovery_category\">what common weeds you can eat</a>, for instance. (<em>Disclosure:</em> I once backed a Kickstarter documentary about <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1719082013/all-my-friends-documentary?ref=discovery&amp;term=all%20of%20my%20friends\">a group of friends traveling to see LCD Soundsystem play \"All My Friends,\"</a> because... I was a foolish college kid?)</p>\n<p>On paper, <em>Mother to Earth</em> sounds like it belongs among the 50s, not the ones. It's a video game documentary not about <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/homebound-with-earthbound/\">Earthbound</a>,</em> not about the franchise that game belongs to (the <em>Mother</em> trilogy), and not even about the original release in the trilogy that inspires the documentary name. Instead, directors Joshua Bone-Christian and Evan Butler had a hyperfocus in mind within this (admittedly already niche) realm: they wanted to track down the story of a specific English-language <em>Mother</em> prototype cartridge. They wanted to learn every detail about how it leaked out of Nintendo headquarters in the early 1990s, landed online in a ROM dump around the turn of the century, then ultimately encouraged Nintendo to release the game on the WiiU virtual console as <em>Earthbound Beginnings</em> in 2015. (<em>Phew</em>.)</p>\n<p>To put it bluntly, <em>Mother to Earth</em> is the kind of documentary you almost can't believe exists. It's a niche project about a niche project, the kind of thing the production team probably wouldn't have been able to make in an era before crowdfunding. But if you have even a moderate interest in online fandom, <em>Earthbound</em>, or video game-history preservation, you'll be glad they succeeded. <em>Mother to Earth</em> turns out to be a surprising reminder that nowadays even the oddest of topics has the potential to find an audience, grow with the encouragement of that small but dedicated support system, and ultimately deliver something fascinating.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744396#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744396&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0b116e1fde25572c82bc64ff8850327d0d1a956cbe8cc75f77d84fb33ba31229","category":"Tech"}
