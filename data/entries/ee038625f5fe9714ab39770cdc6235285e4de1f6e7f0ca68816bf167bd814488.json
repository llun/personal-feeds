This basic fact is a large part of why shooting a gun has become such a natural means of interacting with games from a first-person perspective. If your character is looking at something, shooting a gun lets you instantly and easily engage with whatever you're looking at.</p>\n<p>There's one other major real-life action where this simple point-and-shoot mechanic applies: photography. Nintendo was among the first game-makers to realize this over 20 years ago, creating <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/over-21-years-later-pokemon-snap-is-coming-back-on-switch/\"><em>Pokémon Snap</em></a> for the Nintendo 64 as a new type of first-person \"shooter\" (it doesn't hurt that cameras fit much better than guns with Pokémon's family-friendly branding). In the years since, though, only a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=635CjcizMg4\">handful</a> of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/08/no-mans-sky-is-a-game-about-photography-it-just-doesnt-know-it/\">games</a> have taken Nintendo's lead and replaced \"shoot a gun\" with \"shoot a photo\" as the main verb.</p>\n<p>So it's down to Nintendo to revive and expand its own good idea with the awkwardly titled <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> for the Switch. Though the update can get a bit repetitive and tedious at times, this secret-packed photo safari is a great mix of chill moments and competitive personal striving for the best shots.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760572#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760572&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ee038625f5fe9714ab39770cdc6235285e4de1f6e7f0ca68816bf167bd814488","category":"Tech"}
