Parents of two of the boys sued Snap, arguing that Snapchat's \"speed filter\" encouraged the boys to accelerate their car to more than 100 miles per hour.\n<p>Last year, Snap convinced a federal trial judge that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shielded Snap from liability in the case. The once-obscure 1996 law has become a frequent source of controversy as technology giants have used it to disclaim responsibility for harmful content on their platforms.</p>\n<p>Snap argued that the law gave it immunity in the boys' death. Snapchat pioneered the use of image filters, a feature that has been widely copied by other apps. In 2017, Snapchat's offerings included a speed filter that displayed a user's current speedâ€”either on its own or superimposed on the user's photo. Users could use this filter to show their friends how fast they were moving at the time of the post.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762775#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762775&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
