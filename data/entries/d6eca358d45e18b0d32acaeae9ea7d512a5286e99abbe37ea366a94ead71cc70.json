The way it works is\nthat when you go to a website using Safari, iCloud Private Relay\ntakes your IP address to connect you to the website and then\nencrypts the URL so that app developers, and even Apple, don’t\nknow what website you are visiting. The IP and encrypted URL then\ntravels to an intermediary relay station run by what Apple calls a\n“trusted partner”. In a media interview published yesterday, Apple\nwould not say who the trusted partners are but I can confirm,\nbased on public details (as shown below; Akamai on left, Fastly on\nthe right), that Akamai, Fastly and Cloudflare are being used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a little weird that Apple doesn’t want to talk about who these “trusted partners” are, because if we don’t know who they are, how are we supposed to trust them? Putting your name on a product or service is a badge of trust.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/20/icloud-private-relay-partners\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d6eca358d45e18b0d32acaeae9ea7d512a5286e99abbe37ea366a94ead71cc70","category":"Tech"}
