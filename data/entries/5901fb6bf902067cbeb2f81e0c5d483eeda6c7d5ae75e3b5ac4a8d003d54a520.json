YouTuber Jon Prosser <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1380536151996559362\">claimed</a> the Pixel 5a was canceled due to the well-known <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-smartphones-are-the-next-to-get-hit-by-the-global-chip-shortage/\">chip shortage</a> that is affecting most major tech sectors. <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-reportedly-canceled#update\">Android Central</a> backed up that report saying \"the Google Pixel 5a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/llsethj/status/1380574052385980425/photo/1\">is dead</a>\" (the site has since <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-reportedly-canceled\">re-written</a> the report) citing two different sources of their own. Google quickly responded by shooting those reports down, telling <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/google-pixel-5a-5g-official/\">9to5Google</a>, \"Pixel 5a 5G is not canceled. It will be available later this year in the US and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.\" Alright then!</p>\n<p>While that's official confirmation that the Pixel 5a \"5G\" is coming out sometime this year, it doesn't seem like reports of limited chip supply were totally off-base. Coming out only in the US and Japan would be a dramatic reduction of the Pixel line's already very small list of supported countries. When it comes to worldwide distribution, the Pixel line is one of the worst in the industry, typically launching in only 9-12 countries. Competitors like Apple and Samsung launch in anywhere from 70-100+ countries, and it sounds like we're now down to two countries for Pixel phones.</p>\n<p>Of course, the Pixel 5a comes out in the US because Google is based in the US, but seeing Japan as the second country was a bit of a surprise. It turns out that's actually the second-biggest market Google supports with the Pixel line. Compared to the <a href=\"https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-countries-by-smartphone-penetration-and-users/\">top-10</a> biggest smartphone markets, Google's \"<a href=\"https://support.google.com/store/answer/2462844?hl=en\">device availability page</a>\" lists the Pixel for sale in #3 USA, #7 Japan, and #9 Germany. That's it. Google previously dabbled in India (and I definitely would have guessed the US <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/google-allos-limitations-explained-in-one-word-india/\">and India</a> would be the last two countries standing), but India is no longer listed on the Pixel device availability page and obviously isn't in the cards for the Pixel 5a.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755854#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755854&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5901fb6bf902067cbeb2f81e0c5d483eeda6c7d5ae75e3b5ac4a8d003d54a520","category":"Tech"}
