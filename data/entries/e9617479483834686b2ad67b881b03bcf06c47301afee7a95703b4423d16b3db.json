Apple shipped 55.6 million wearable devices during the quarter for 36.2 percent market share.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/applewatchseroundup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"959\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-759867\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThat's the same market share Apple held in the fourth quarter of 2019, but overall device shipments were up from 43.7 million in Q4 2019. Apple's competitors don't even come close. Xiaomi shipped an estimated 13.5 million wearable devices for 8.8 percent market share, followed by Samsung at 13 million devices and Huawei at 10.2 million devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/wearable-devices-idc-q4-2020.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1958\" height=\"932\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788976\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple Watch shipments rose an estimated 45.6 percent thanks to the different pricing intervals of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, SE, and Series 3, and \"hearables\" shipments of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> surged during the quarter.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAcross all of 2020, IDC believes Apple shipped 151.4 million wearable devices for 34.1 percent market share. Xiaomi was the number two wearable device manufacturer in 2020 with 50.7 million devices shipped, followed by Huawei and Samsung with 43.5 million and 40 million devices shipped, respectively.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/wearable-devices-idc-2020.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1958\" height=\"932\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788975\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple does not provide specific breakdowns of the number of Apple Watch and &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; models shipped, so IDC's data is based on estimates. During a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/apple-wearables-revenue-record-q1-2021/\">January earnings call</a>, Apple said that wearables set a new revenue record in fiscal Q1 2021, which corresponds to the fourth calendar quarter of 2020.
