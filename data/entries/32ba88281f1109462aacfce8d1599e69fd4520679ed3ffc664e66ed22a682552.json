Barclays said its research is at least partly based on \"extensive industry conversations\" with suppliers in recent weeks. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe analysts believe that a smaller notch on iPhone 13 models will be the result of a \"more tightly integrated version of the current structured light system\" for Face ID, adding that a \"bigger shift\" is likely to come in 2022, with Apple apparently aiming to adopt time-of-flight architecture for Face ID that would allow for an \"even smaller footprint.\" This lines up with Kuo's prediction that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">at least some 2022 iPhones could feature a hole-punch display</a>, with only a small hole visible on the screen, like many of Samsung's recent smartphones.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHere's the excerpt from the research note, with emphasis added:<blockquote>For the coming iPhone 13 cycle in 2H21, we foresee a more tightly integrated version of the existing structured light system, which will enable the long awaited reduction in the notch. On the rear, we do not anticipate Apple to broaden the adoption of the Lidar 3D sensor beyond the Pro models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor the 2H22 product cycle, we anticipate an architectural shift from structured light to time-of-flight, allowing for an even smaller footprint. Based on our industry conversations, we do not think structured light beneath the screen is likely to be ready for mass deployment in 2H22. <strong>We also view the adoption of fingerprint-under-glass, that likely is added in the 2H21 iPhones</strong>, as a structural headwind for additional 3D sensing content at Apple and could be the security feature of the future.</blockquote>The return of Touch ID with a fingerprint scanner under the display has been rumored several times. Back in August 2019, Kuo said Apple planned to launch an iPhone equipped with both Face ID and a fingerprint scanner under the display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/05/kuo-iphone-with-both-touch-id-and-face-id-due-2021/\">in 2021</a>, but in his research note earlier this month, he did not mention this feature coming to iPhone 13 models. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-optical/\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern</a> have also claimed that Apple is at least testing an under-display fingerprint scanner for iPhone 13 models, so time will tell whether the feature makes the cut.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBarclays analysts were the first to claim that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/25/iphone-12-could-drop-charger-barclays/\">planning to stop including a charger with iPhones</a>. In the past, they also accurately revealed True Tone coming to the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, the removal of the headphone jack adapter with iPhone XS and iPhone XR models, and the removal of 3D Touch on all iPhone 11 models.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/\">Barclays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">iPhone 13 Models Will &#039;Likely&#039; Have Touch ID Under the Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-models-will-likely-have-touch-id-under-the-display.2288100/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Zm33L3UZE7o:ICZ5I5L2y9Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Zm33L3UZE7o:ICZ5I5L2y9Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Zm33L3UZE7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"32ba88281f1109462aacfce8d1599e69fd4520679ed3ffc664e66ed22a682552","category":"Apple"}
