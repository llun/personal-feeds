Following in the footsteps of antecedents going back to the miniseries based on <em>Roots</em>, they've tackled material that's too intricate and too sprawling to possibly squeeze into a movie-length work. At their best, these adaptations have done justice to the most challenging material.</p>\n<p>All of which has left the Ars staff wanting more. If producers and networks are willing to put that much love into works we either weren't familiar with or weren't in love with, what might they manage with some <em>really</em> good material?</p>\n<p>What started as a watercooler chitchat morphed into an article and has now blossomed into a series of short pleas/pitches—Hollywood, we're all easy to reach. And we're giving you, the reader, the chance to tell us how wrong we are or to come up with some suggestions of your own.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746499#p3\">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746499&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c068a0d602479357fcca55dd558284bec04703b2a5941893185c4ca1b2e60775","category":"Tech"}
