The device will be positioned as the \"cheapest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g-iphone/\">5G iPhone</a> ever.\" The most affordable ‌iPhone‌ with 5G right now is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>, so presumably the ‌iPhone SE‌ will be a good deal more affordable than the $699 price point of that device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere have been rumors of an \"‌iPhone SE‌ Plus\" with a larger display and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> power button, which Kuo has also mentioned in the past, but there's no word of this bigger ‌iPhone SE‌ in Kuo's note and we haven't heard new details about it for some time, so it is not clear if it's been scrapped or is something that's coming at a later date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo also previously said that Apple is developing a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> with a 6-inch LCD, Face ID support, and 5G, and it's possible thst this future device, which is said to be launching in 2023, will also be in the SE family.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no specific word on when we can expect the next-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, but the first half of 2022 perhaps suggests a spring event.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE 2020</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/\">Kuo: 2022 iPhone SE Will Be the 'Cheapest 5G iPhone Ever'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2022-iphone-se-will-be-the-cheapest-5g-iphone-ever.2302018/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GTzvF21d06k:DW3YwGvBUrQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GTzvF21d06k:DW3YwGvBUrQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GTzvF21d06k\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cf79e815a76851932d498415da15b7b97364310b79dbe116caf16754091d16aa","category":"Apple"}
