Since then, the iterations of the organization now called the Ineos Grenadiers have claimed 12 Grand Tour wins – including seven Tours de France – and a host of other major results aboard Pinarello bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the team noted in a press release, its partnership with Pinarello has lasted through six successive versions of Pinarello’s flagship Dogma frame, which have generally made their racing debuts ridden by Sky/Ineos riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At Pinarello we have strived to constantly develop our flagship race bike to keep the Ineos Grenadiers at the head of the peloton. That commitment to having the best-possible equipment started with the Dogma 60.1, right through to the Dogma F12 of recent years,” said Fausto Pinarello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The same evolution has followed in the cobbled classics and also in our time trial bikes. To see Filippo Ganna take the team’s 50th Grand Tour stage victory in Milan on the Bolide Evo was yet another proud moment for everyone at Pinarello.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/the-ineos-grenadiers-will-ride-pinarello-bikes-for-four-more-seasons/\">The Ineos Grenadiers will ride Pinarello bikes for four more seasons</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ed5f49b8b2e376f05927870e0ef43c8845faf5188622ffc7342a6584585ca48a","category":"Cycling"}
