A projectâ€™s strength consists of both code quality and the welcoming community and ecosystem built around it.</p>\n<p>In our inaugural year of the program, we are grateful to have welcomed Ambassadors who embody all of the above and more.</p>\n<p>While 2020 was challenging in many ways, we are mindful of the opportunity we had to create connections with and between this community of 48 Ambassadors.</p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1611170599-mehdi.png alt=Credit: @mehdilaruelle><p>Credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehdilaruelle/status/1301041497823944704\">@mehdilaruelle</a></p><img src=https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1611170704-kerim-jacob.png alt=Credit: @ksatirli & @arctiqjacob><p>Credit: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArctiqJacob/status/1299763323286753281/retweets/with_comments\">@ksatirli &#x26; @arctiqjacob</a></p><p>We are proud of the fact that participants in this year's program are pillars of our principles.
