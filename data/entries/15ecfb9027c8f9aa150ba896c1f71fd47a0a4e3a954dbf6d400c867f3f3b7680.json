The longer a pack is in use, the lower the environmental impact of the resources used to make it. Much like a bike, packs sometimes need a bit of upkeep and maintenance to keep them working well over the years, which is why we design our packs to be easily repaired. By investing in returning purpose to these packs through revive, we hope to reduce unnecessary waste and extend the useful lifecycle of idle packs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"https://revive.apidura.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apidura</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"15ecfb9027c8f9aa150ba896c1f71fd47a0a4e3a954dbf6d400c867f3f3b7680","category":"Cycling"}
