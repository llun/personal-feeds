Parallels also indicates that on an M1 Mac, Parallels Desktop 16.5 uses 2.5x less energy than on the latest Intel-based MacBook Air.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMicrosoft does not yet offer a retail version of ARM-based Windows, with the Windows 10 ARM Insider Preview <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64\">available on Microsoft's website</a> for Windows Insider program members. The ability to run macOS Big Sur in a virtual machine is a feature that Parallels hopes to add support for in Parallels Desktop later this year as well. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAnyone with a Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac license can get an automatic update to Parallels Desktop 16.5 at no additional cost. Otherwise, one-time or subscription-based pricing options are listed on the <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100ldfvw/creativeref:1100l33242\">Parallels Desktop product page</a>, with Parallels currently offering 10% off most license configurations with code <strong>2KQ-PTG-DYZ</strong>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Paralles.
