Today, Sony announced pricing and release timing for its flagship 2021 OLED, the A90J.</p>\n<p>Preorders have already started in Europe and the UK, and the US is expected to follow any time now. But regardless of the staggered preorders, the TVs will ship this month in both regions.</p>\n<p>The A90J will be available in 55-, 65-, and 83-inch sizes. The 55-inch model will cost $3,000 in the US, while its 65-inch counterpart will cost a whopping $4,000. US and EU pricing haven't been announced for the 83-inch model, but it costs £7,000 in the UK, so let that be your guide.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746048#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746048&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff2df670ea780ae706224b2750b736710cd3fd7ae728020778c7cc2e59b32cf8","category":"Tech"}
