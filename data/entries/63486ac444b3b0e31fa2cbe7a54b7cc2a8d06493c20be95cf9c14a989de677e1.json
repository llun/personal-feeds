On his return, were to be Bernard ‘Beefy’ Heath, road captain, and Raymond ‘Cheesey’ Bottomley, cook and chief photographer. Another man, John ‘Inky’ Hinchcliffe, had a last-minute problem and was refused release from National Service. So with only one week to go Ron Bartle, 24 years old and an experienced touring cyclist, was drafted in as mechanic and fourth wheel. The short notice perhaps explains his lack of a nickname in the documents of the expedition. But it certainly did not hurt his case that he was the right height to ride the custom-made reinforced touring bike – fixed wheel – that had already been made by Viking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this video by Rapha, Bartle recalls the journey. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/video-the-long-and-winding-road/\">Video: A 1958 trek across the interior of Iceland</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"CyclingTips","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"63486ac444b3b0e31fa2cbe7a54b7cc2a8d06493c20be95cf9c14a989de677e1","category":"Cycling"}
