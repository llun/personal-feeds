Moore, \"For All Mankind\" is a sci-fi series that imagines what the world might have been like if the global space race had never ended and the space program had remained a U.S. priority.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe second season of \"For All Mankind\" picks up in 1983, a decade after the first season. At the height of the Cold War, tensions between the United States and USSR are at their peak. Reagan is president and the US and USSR are fighting over the resources available on the moon.<blockquote>Season two of the space drama picks up a decade later in 1983. It's the height of the Cold War and tensions between the United States and the USSR are at their peak. Ronald Reagan is president and the greater ambitions of science and space exploration are at threat of being squandered as the US and Soviets go head-to-head to control sites rich in resources on the moon. The Department of Defense has moved into Mission Control, and the militarization of NASA becomes central to several characters' stories: some fight it, some use it as an opportunity to advance their own interests, and some find themselves at the height of a conflict that may lead to nuclear war.</blockquote>\"For All Mankind\" stars Joel Kinnaman, Michael Dorman, Wrenn Schmidt, Shantel VanSanten, Sarah Jones, and Jodi Balfour.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-for-all-mankind-season-2/\">Apple Shares &#039;For All Mankind&#039; Season 2 Featurette</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-for-all-mankind-season-2-featurette.2284177/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yuprEVcUhiQ:AJTAH48Wd-4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yuprEVcUhiQ:AJTAH48Wd-4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/yuprEVcUhiQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"336e68d6513a46f5677771b46f0a3025ab2afe3ac73db42a538fd0e6850bfb50","category":"Apple"}
