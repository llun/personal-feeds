Made from beige fabric that accurately matches the color of the original Macintosh, it features a black screen, a disk drive, and a rainbow logo.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/1984-throw-blanket-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783957\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith all of the details included, it is unmistakable as a classic Macintosh, making it a fun addition to any Apple fan's room. To go along with the 1984 blanket, Throwboy also has the <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/shop/products/icon-throw-blanket\">Icon Throw Blanket</a>, modeled after the original Mac Finder icon with a two-tone design and a smile. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/icon-throw-blanket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"621\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783962\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's also a <a href=\"https://throwboy.com/collections/shop/products/cassette-throw-blanket\">cassette tape blanket</a> that looks like a vintage cassette tape, but that one isn't Mac related.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/icon-blanket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1013\" height=\"1014\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783958\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nEach throw blanket from Throwboy is priced at &#36;46.99 and measures in at 50 inches by 60 inches.
