In the fourth quarter of 2020, however, 86 of the top 100 earning non-game apps worldwide offered subscriptions, which is actually down slightly from 89 in the same quarter of 2019.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nReflecting a wider historical trend, spending on subscription-based apps in Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; was vastly more than in the Google Play Store: \r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>Consumers have historically spent more on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; than on Google's marketplace, and the same holds true for subscription apps. Globally, the top 100 subscription apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; generated &#36;10.3 billion in 2020, up 32 percent from &#36;7.8 billion the previous year. The cohort of 100 top earners on Google Play saw &#36;2.7 billion last year, up 42 percent Y/Y from &#36;1.9 billion in 2019.</blockquote>The only performance indicator in which the Google Play Store beat the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; was in terms of year-on-year growth for U.S. user spending on subscription apps. \r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>Looking at the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, consumers spent &#36;4.5 billion in 2020 on the top 100 earning non-game apps offering subscriptions, up 25 percent from approximately &#36;3.6 billion in 2019. While the top 100 earning subscription apps on Google Play did not generate as much revenue, they did see greater Y/Y growth. In 2020, the top Google Play subscription apps in the U.S. saw &#36;1.4 billion spent, up 40 percent Y/Y from &#36;1 billion.</blockquote><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/top-grossing-subscription-apps-us-2020.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2900\" height=\"1728\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783237\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle was the big winner this year in terms of subscription app spending, both globally and in the U.S. YouTube was the subscription app leader across both stores, earning &#36;991.7 million in gross revenue globally and &#36;562 million in the U.S. It was also the top earning subscription app on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite the numbers, the subscription apps generally divide &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; users between those for and against the revenue model. Apple began incentivizing developers to sell their apps for a recurring fee instead of a one-time cost when it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/08/apple-major-app-store-changes/\">made changes</a> to its ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ subscription policies in 2016. Usually, Apple takes 30 percent of app revenue, but developers who are able to maintain a subscription with a customer longer than a year see Apple's cut drop down to 15 percent.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn late 2017, Apple began letting developers offer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/11/apple-allowing-app-pre-orders/\">discounted introductory pricing and time-limited free trials</a> on auto-renewable app subscriptions, based on the idea that subscriptions provide a higher likelihood of an engaged audience.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sensor-tower/\">Sensor Tower</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/app-store-top-100-subs-revenue-2020/\">Sensor Tower: iOS Users Spent &#36;10.3 billion on Top 100 Subscription Apps in 2020, Up 32% Year-on-Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sensor-tower-ios-users-spent-10-3-billion-on-top-100-subscription-apps-in-2020-up-32-year-on-year.2284380/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3Ht5swSHxsE:7QR-12NVZtY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3Ht5swSHxsE:7QR-12NVZtY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3Ht5swSHxsE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"54a7bed6178fcf8319a016d359ae1cadd778fb58e46d61b43234f8892afb026c","category":"Apple"}
