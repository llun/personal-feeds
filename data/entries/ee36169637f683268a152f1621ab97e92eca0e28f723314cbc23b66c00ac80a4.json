{"title":"Apple Wins Patent for iPhone Display With Variable Refresh Rates Up to 240Hz","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-patent-variable-refresh-rate-up-to-240hz/","date":1613486027000,"content":"A new <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=60&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&p=2&S1=(%22Apple+Inc%22.AANM.)&OS=AANM/%22Apple+Inc%22&RS=AANM/%22Apple+Inc%22\">Apple patent</a> published today by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office describes an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> display that, with high refresh mode enabled, may be capable of updating content at two times, three times, or even four times the native refresh rate, as reported by <em><a href=\"https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2021/02/apple-wins-a-patent-for-displays-with-multiple-refresh-rate-modes-ranging-from-60-120hz-and-much-higher.html\">Patently Apple</a></em>. For example, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a 60Hz display would be able to increase its variable refresh rate to 120Hz, 180Hz, or 240Hz automatically. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/iphone-12-120hz-thumbnail-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4898\" height=\"2756\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-748255\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nFor those unfamiliar, refresh rate refers to how many times a display refreshes every second (the higher the refresh rate, the smoother the content on the display will be.) All current iPhones have a refresh rate of 60Hz, but starting in 2017, all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models feature ProMotion technology, enabling a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRumors of 120Hz coming to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> proved to be untrue, but there is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/samsung-supply-120hz-panels-iphone-13-pro/\">renewed confidence</a> that ProMotion will make an appearance on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>. During the rumor mill last year, some claimed that the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/10/iphone-12-120hz-promotion-3x-camera-face-id/\">automatically switch</a> between 60Hz and 120Hz depending on what the user was doing on their device in an effort to preserve battery life. While the ability for a device to switch between 60Hz and 120Hz is not new, the patent describing the ability for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to push the refresh rate to as high as 180Hz or 240Hz is.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe lack of a 120Hz refresh rate on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; so far could be linked to the fact that Apple tends to treads carefully when adding features, such as ProMotion, that could be detrimental to battery life or system-wide performance. Rumors suggest that Apple will overcome this power consumption dilemma by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/iphone-13-pro-120hz-display-rumors/\">adopting low-power LTPO display technology for iPhone 13 models</a>, allowing for 120Hz without a significant impact on battery life.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA higher refresh rate could be beneficial for several use cases, such as gaming or augmented reality. If a user is simply watching a movie or messaging a friend, the display could switch back to its 60Hz native refresh rate as a means to save battery life.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">new rumors claimed</a> that alongside a 120Hz refresh rate, the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup will also have an always-on-display. Always-on displays allow users to see certain information, such as the time, date, or battery life, at all times. All high-end iPhones since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X have OLED displays, meaning each pixel is individually controlled, allowing the device to only light up the pixels needed to show users limited information, preserving battery life.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/\">patent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/promotion/\">ProMotion</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-patent-variable-refresh-rate-up-to-240hz/\">Apple Wins Patent for iPhone Display With Variable Refresh Rates Up to 240Hz</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-patent-for-iphone-display-with-variable-refresh-rates-up-to-240hz.2284903/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ypXO9GuZAHM:47y1Ae0s_KQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ypXO9GuZAHM:47y1Ae0s_KQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ypXO9GuZAHM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ee36169637f683268a152f1621ab97e92eca0e28f723314cbc23b66c00ac80a4","category":"Apple"}
