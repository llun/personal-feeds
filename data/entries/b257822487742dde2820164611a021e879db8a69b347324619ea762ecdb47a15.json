Today, the DMG <a href=\"https://www.deadmangravel.com/registration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">registration is open</a> for women, those who identify as female, and BIPOC participants &#8211; and general registration opening on March 23rd for everyone else. The event is scheduled for July 31, 2021 in Nederland, Colorado. This unique event strives to be both inclusive &#8211; as organizers believe everyone should feel welcome, regardless of experience, race, gender, or sexual identity/orientation &#8211; and challenging &#8211; as very few other races have as much climbing, technical sections, and sustained elevation.</p>\n<p><em>To strike a balance between challenging and inclusive, Dead Man Gravel will feature three courses: the 66 mile Tungsten loop, the 41 mile Gold loop, and the 25 mile Silver loop, providing three distinct experiences for riders of all levels.Â </em></p>\n<p>DMG is also partnering with Ride for Racial Justice and Shark Tooth Cycling, two non-profits doing incredible work in bringing new, and typically disadvantaged, athletes into the sport by helping to increase awareness and reduce barriers to entry.</p>\n<p>Register today if you&#8217;re BIPOC, or female at <a href=\"https://www.deadmangravel.com/registration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dead Man Gravel</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b257822487742dde2820164611a021e879db8a69b347324619ea762ecdb47a15","category":"Cycling"}
