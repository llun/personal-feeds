{"title":"Google Circumvents Roku Ban by Adding YouTube TV to the Main YouTube App","link":"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/next-steps-youtube-tv-members-roku/","date":1620418809000,"content":"\n<p>Google’s official YouTube blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today, we’re introducing a new <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7452153#open_yttv_inside_yt_app\">feature</a> that gives you access to\nYouTube TV from within the YouTube app, making it easier to enjoy\nall the content you love. Existing members can easily access\nYouTube TV by clicking on “Go to YouTube TV” in the main YouTube\napp. This update will be available to all YouTube TV members on\nRoku over the next few days, and we will expand to as many devices\nas we can over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: <em>Fuck you, Roku. We dare you to ban the YouTube app.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Separately, we are also in ongoing, long-term conversations with\nRoku to certify that new devices meet our technical requirements.\nThis certification process exists to ensure a consistent and\nhigh-quality YouTube experience across different devices,\nincluding Google’s own — so you know how to navigate the app and\nwhat to expect. We’ll continue our conversations with Roku on\ncertification, in good faith, with the goal of advocating for our\nmutual customers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: <em>You’ll add hardware support for the AV1 codec whether you want to or not, because we say so.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425035/google-youtube-tv-roku-app-feud\">Roku’s response, via The Verge</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google’s actions are the clear conduct of an unchecked monopolist\nbent on crushing fair competition and harming consumer choice. The\nbundling announcement by YouTube highlights the kind of predatory\nbusiness practices used by Google that Congress, Attorney Generals\nand regulatory bodies around the world are investigating. Roku has\nnot asked for one additional dollar in financial value from\nYouTubeTV. We have simply asked Google to stop their\nanticompetitive behavior of manipulating user search results to\ntheir unique financial benefit and to stop demanding access to\nsensitive data that no other partner on our platform receives\ntoday. In response, Google has continued its practice of blatantly\nleveraging its YouTube monopoly to force an independent company\ninto an agreement that is both bad for consumers and bad for fair\ncompetition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: <em>Fuck us? No, fuck you, Google.</em></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/07/google-roku-youtube\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b38aabceb0409649710e586d8ae4497654b297c4e9b48f848db750ebc63949e6","category":"Tech"}
