First and foremost, MGM has been one of the few classic Hollywood studios to avoid joining a larger corporation so far. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/disney-outbids-comcast-in-escalating-bidding-war-for-21st-century-fox/\">Disney acquired Fox</a> in 2018. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/comcast-acquires-full-ownership-of-nbcuniversal-ahead-of-schedule/\">Comcast purchased NBCUniversal</a> in 2013. <a href=\"https://variety.com/1994/biz/news/viacom-takes-over-paramount-119173/\">ViacomCBS has had Paramount</a> since the mid-1990s. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/att-to-spin-off-warnermedia-will-try-to-act-like-a-telecom-company-again/\">And until yesterday</a>, AT&amp;T had control of Warner Bros. as part of an overall deal with WarnerMedia.</p>\n<p>But beyond the pure business spectacle, MGM is also one of the oldest film studios around. It dates back to the 1920s. The studio produced iconic Hollywood projects like <em>Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, </em>and <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em> Later, it made the likes of <em>Annie Hall </em>and <em>The Silence of the Lambs. </em>And though the film industry has been struggling for much of this century—<a href=\"https://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2010/11/03/mgm-officially-file-bankruptcy/\">MGM filed for bankruptcy</a> (and later emerged from it) long before COVID-19, in 2010—this studio has continued to produce critically adored and commercially successful entertainment. MGM boasts rejuvenated franchises like James Bond and Rocky Balboa (in the excellent Michael B. Jordan vehicle <em>Creed</em>), TV projects like <em>The Handmaid's Tale </em>and <em>Survivor, </em>and highly anticipated films like <em>No Time to Die </em>and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Gucci\">House of Gucci</a> </em>(starring Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, Jared Leto, and... just take our money, OK?).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765675#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765675&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d9ca76ed2685a2456e7b5e41a0ec46dbbcc32c9a0eacb1135ce8cce0b341de0a","category":"Tech"}
