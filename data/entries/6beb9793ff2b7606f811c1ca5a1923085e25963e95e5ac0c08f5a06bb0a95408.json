Sure, the guide has\nnumerous updates and lots of new content, but the real story isn’t\nin the details, but in the larger directions of Apple’s security\nprogram, how that impacts Apple’s customers, and what it means to\nthe technology industry at large.</p>\n\n<p>From that broader perspective, the writing is on the wall. <em>The\nfuture of cybersecurity is vertical integration.</em> By vertical\nintegration, I mean the combination of hardware, software, and\ncloud-based services to build a comprehensive ecosystem. Vertical\nintegration for increased security isn’t merely a trend at Apple,\nit’s one we see in wide swaths of the industry, including such key\nplayers as Amazon Web Services. When security really matters, it’s\nhard to compete if you don’t have complete control of the stack:\nhardware, software, and services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Rich Mogull on Apple’s Updated 2021 Platform Security Guide’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/19/mogull-apple-platform-security-guide\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6beb9793ff2b7606f811c1ca5a1923085e25963e95e5ac0c08f5a06bb0a95408","category":"Tech"}
