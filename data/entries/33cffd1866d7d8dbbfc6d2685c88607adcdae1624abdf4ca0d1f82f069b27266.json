The updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Pros feature Thunderbolt connectivity, optional 5G, and up to 2TB storage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPad-Pro-Feature-Orange.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple's new ‌M1‌ iMacs are priced starting at $1,299 for a 7-core GPU, and $1,499 for an 8-core GPU and additional color choices. The iMacs are equipped with the same ‌M1‌ chip that's in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and the radically redesigned machines feature a super slim body and a range of bright colors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iMac-M1-Raindow-Feature-Spread-out.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K is priced starting at $179 for 32GB of storage, and it is similar to the existing ‌Apple TV‌ 4K but with a faster A12 Bionic processor, and support for high frame rate HDR, plus it comes with a revamped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote with a touch-enabled clickpad. You can get the ‌Siri‌ Remote on its own or bundled with the ‌Apple TV‌ HD, which has not received an update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-green.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nVarious other accessories such as the new <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJQL3LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-129%E2%80%91inch-5th-generation-us-english\">Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</a> (available in black or white) can also be purchased starting today. Note that if you're getting a 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, last year's Magic Keyboard is compatible, but the fit <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/ipad-pro-original-magic-keyboard-compatibility/\">may not be perfect</a> when it's closed. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/2021-Magic-Keyboard-Blue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe do not know whether supplies will be limited, but it seems likely given Apple's recent comments on stock shortages for Macs and iPads and rumors of manufacturing issues for the 12.9-inch mini-LED display. Those who want one of Apple's new devices on launch day should aim to order as soon as possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has not announced an official release date for the new iMacs, ‌iPad‌ Pros, and ‌Apple TV‌ models, but accidentally leaked information suggests that the new devices will begin arriving to customers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-shipping-may-21/\">on May 21</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-now-available/\">New M1 iPad Pros, 24-Inch M1 iMacs, Apple TV 4K, and Siri Remote Now Available to Order</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-m1-ipad-pros-24-inch-m1-imacs-apple-tv-4k-and-siri-remote-now-available-to-order.2294071/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=f-tMGBAD5sY:oklvxgMpo-Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=f-tMGBAD5sY:oklvxgMpo-Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/f-tMGBAD5sY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"33cffd1866d7d8dbbfc6d2685c88607adcdae1624abdf4ca0d1f82f069b27266","category":"Apple"}
