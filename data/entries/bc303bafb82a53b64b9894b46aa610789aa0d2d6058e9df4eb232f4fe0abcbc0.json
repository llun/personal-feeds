Yes, they look a state but the gloss white paint is frankly a stupid colour for pedals – they looked second-hand after my first ride on them all those years ago.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> With virtually no maintenance, the 540s have just continued working and never let me down (though that glossy paint is slippery when wet).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These Shimano 540s have truly been used and abused, and because they were so cheap, I’ve always had in mind that if they were lost on my travels, it wouldn’t matter because I’ve had my thirty-odd quid’s worth of use out of them.</p>\n<p>If I’m honest, though, if I did lose these plucky little upstarts, I’d be gutted. They’ve been an ever-reliable companion on some of the best riding I’ve ever done and in sentimental value alone I’d choose these over a pair of flyweight R9100 carbon Dura-Ace pedals any day.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £34.99</li>\n</ul>","author":"Warren Rossiter","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"bc303bafb82a53b64b9894b46aa610789aa0d2d6058e9df4eb232f4fe0abcbc0","category":"Cycling"}
