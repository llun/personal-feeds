After installing ‌iOS 15‌, the proper ‌watchOS 8‌ profile from <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Apple's beta software website</a> must also be installed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe software can be accessed by going to General &gt; Software Update in the Apple Watch app on ‌iPhone‌. To update, ‌Apple Watch‌ needs to have 50 percent battery life, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌iPhone‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌watchOS 8‌, like ‌iOS 15‌, introduces improvements to the Wallet app with support for driver's licenses and new types of keys for homes, cars, and hotels. The Home app lets you see who is at the door with HomeKit-enabled cameras, plus the Home app has been updated to make it easier to get to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> accessories and scenes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere are new Tai Chi and Pilates workout types, and the Breathe app has been renamed to Mindfulness because it has a new \"Reflect\" feature that gives you thoughtful notions to consider to for mindfulness purposes. A Portrait Watch Face pulls portrait photos from the ‌iPhone‌, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app has new ways to view and navigate photos collections.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> app for locating lost items and devices right from the wrist, and the Messages app now supports sending GIFs. There are tons of other new features in ‌watchOS 8‌, with details <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-8/\">available in our watchOS 8 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/apple-seeds-first-watchos-8-public-beta/\">Apple Seeds First watchOS 8 Public Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-watchos-8-public-beta.2302834/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lMKcVBLOYJM:v688qFtfTrw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lMKcVBLOYJM:v688qFtfTrw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lMKcVBLOYJM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce4f32b242e62b3bbc82e42f58aa897107e10b0b2906f64c4fa591bfb6e45f2a","category":"Apple"}
