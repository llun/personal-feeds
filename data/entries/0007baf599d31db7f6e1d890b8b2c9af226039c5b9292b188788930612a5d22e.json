Higher scores indicate \"healthier cardiac, respiratory, circulatory, and neuromuscular function,\" according to Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nConducted by Stanford University researchers and funded by Apple, the study provided 110 Veterans Affairs patients with cardiovascular disease with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 7 and Apple Watch Series 3. Patients conducted regular at-home six-minute walking tests, which were then compared to their standard in-clinic 6MWT performance.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe study found that an Apple Watch was able to accurately assess frailty with a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 85 percent when supervised in a clinical setting. When assessed in an unsupervised setting at home, the Apple Watch was able to accurately assess frailty with a sensitivity of 83 percent and specificity of 60 percent.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe findings indicate that passive activity data gathered by the Apple Watch is an accurate predictor of in-clinic 6MWT performance.<blockquote>In this longitudinal observational study, passive activity data acquired by an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch were an accurate predictor of in-clinic 6MWT performance. This finding suggests that frailty and functional capacity could be monitored and evaluated remotely in patients with cardiovascular disease, enabling safer and higher resolution monitoring of patients.</blockquote>While the study used a specially-developed app called \"VascTrac\" to gather 6MWT data alongside the Apple Watch's passively-collected activity data, Apple has since included a series of new mobility-related health metrics in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a>, including the 6MWT. It is likely that preliminary data from studies such as this encouraged Apple to add the metrics in &zwnj;watchOS 7&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe research may urge healthcare providers to offer at-home assessment of functional capacity in cardiovascular disease patients using an Apple Watch.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/27/apple-watch-assess-frailty-study/\">Apple Watch Can Accurately Assess Frailty, Finds Stanford Study</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-can-accurately-assess-frailty-finds-stanford-study.2289801/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bOborQq02m8:7oFOLhIS-Zg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bOborQq02m8:7oFOLhIS-Zg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bOborQq02m8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0007baf599d31db7f6e1d890b8b2c9af226039c5b9292b188788930612a5d22e","category":"Apple"}
