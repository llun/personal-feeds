{"title":"Spotify Launching 'HiFi' Lossless Streaming Option Later This Year","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/spotify-hifi-lossless-streaming-option/","date":1614018573000,"content":"Spotify <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/five-things-to-know-about-spotify-hifi/\">today announced plans</a> to introduce a new \"HiFi\" premium tier later this year, which will provide higher-quality lossless audio. According to Spotify, the feature will offer CD-quality music that will let fans experience more depth and clarity in their favorite tracks.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/spotify-hifi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785045\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nStreaming music services like Tidal, Deezer, and Amazon Music have offered lossless audio options but to date, Spotify and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> have not provided higher quality streaming options.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSpotify is &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s main competitor, so with Spotify planning a HiFi music option, Apple could be planning to also offer higher quality streaming in an effort to remain competitive. A lossless audio tier would also pair well with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">Apple's high-end AirPods Max headphones</a> that were released in late 2020.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's no pricing information available at this time, but Amazon Music's lossless tier is priced at &#36;14.99 per month (&#36;12.99 for Prime subscribers), while Tidal charges &#36;19.99 per month and Deezer charges &#36;14.99 for its high fidelity plan. Spotify plans to launch HiFi in select markets later in the year, and it will be a premium tier add-on.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHiFi was introduced at Spotify's Stream On event, which can be watched in full <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Vvo-2MrSgFE\">on YouTube</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vvo-2MrSgFE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nAt the event, Spotify also said that it <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/spotify-expands-international-footprint-bringing-audio-to-80-new-markets/\">plans to expand</a> to more than 80 new markets in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America, which allows the service to reach over 1 billion potential new customers.
