But in this case, I don’t mind so much.</p>\n<p>This is a purpose-built smart display with a camera-less design aimed at maintaining privacy and bedside utility. That second use case gets one of the biggest additions on the second-gen model: a new sleep tracking function. As for privacy, the Nest Hub doesn't add much new, though the sleep tracking feature introduces some new precautions. The most notable change, however, is a lower price—down from $130 to $99.99 (and sometimes on sale for less). Combined with this unique (for a smart display) ability to track sleep accurately, the value here easily makes the new Nest Hub a top pick for smart displays.</p>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Ars-Technica-Nest-Hub-2nd-Generation-Review-8-980x654.jpg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          The speakers have 50% more bass, which is noticeable and appreciated, though it can still does well with hotword detection.
