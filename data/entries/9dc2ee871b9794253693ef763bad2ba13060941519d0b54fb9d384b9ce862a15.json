The council estimates that 40,060 people were killed in crashes an 8 percent increase from 2019. The rise looks even more shocking when normalizedâ€”it rose from 1.2 to 1.49 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles travelled, a 24 percent increase.\n<p>The National Safety Council also estimates that just under 4.8 million people were injured seriously enough in road crashes to seek medical help for nonfatal injuries. The cost of all this carnage? $474.4 billion in deaths, injuries, and property damage.</p>\n<p>Some states fared better than others.
