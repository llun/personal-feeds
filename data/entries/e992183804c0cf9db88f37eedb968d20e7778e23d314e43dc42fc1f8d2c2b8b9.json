It is 65 miles or 105km, so a big day out with friends or a half day blast if you are riding fast!</p>\n<p>Edinburgh is a pretty unique place to live, with an extinct volcano in the middle of it (Arthur’s Seat), a historic city of just over half a million people, hemmed in by the sea on the north and the Pentland hills in the south. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.komoot.com/collection/1121279/-cyclist-doorstep-rides\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>See the Cyclist Doorstep Rides Collection on komoot</strong></a></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/specialized/9053/specialized-hotwalk-carbon-balance-bike\">Specialized Hotwalk Carbon balance bike: behind the scenes look at £999 kids' bike</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/5323/best-childrens-bikes\">Best children’s bikes: top picks of kids' bikes for every age</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8997/best-children-s-helmets-top-picks-of-kids-cycling-helmets-for-every-age\">Best children’s helmets: top picks of kids' cycling helmets for every age</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThis geography creates some amazing riding within a few miles of the centre where I live, and a labyrinth of old train lines that have been converted to cycle paths, so you can escape the city without having to jostle with the traffic.</p>\n<p>Edinburgh city is one of the smallest council areas in Scotland, so I was intrigued to explore the boundary, and find the furthest circumference without entering East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.</p>\n<p>Finding this boundary route meant finding a GPX file online for the council boundary, importing it into Komoot, then asking the app to suggest the nearest rideable tracks on the gravel biking setting. </p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/05/mark_beaumont_doorstep_ride_03.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The outcome was a fascinating explore on some familiar tracks, but also trails and paths that I had never considered, and wouldn’t unlikely have found myself.</p>\n<p>On January 2nd, I set out with fellow round-the-world cyclist Markus Stitz at 6am in the snow for a 13-hour epic around-the-boundary route, enjoying following the coastline to Portobello beach before cutting inland for the biggest test, a hike-a-bike section above Hillend into the Pentlands and some tough winter riding as we headed east.</p>\n<p>\nOn March 21st the snow had all melted and I wanted to explore the exact same route, but this time alone and as some training for big gravel races later in the year.</p>\n<p>So this time it took 6 hours and 2 minutes, as a flat out time-trial effort. Whilst going much faster, there were still sections where I had to push the bike, and run with it, so good all-round fitness is needed!</p>\n<p>However, the beauty and diverse landscapes were not lost on me, despite going at twice the speed as our first winter explore.</p>\n<p>In terms of highlights, I particularly enjoy the wilder, less explored western parts of the Pentlands, beyond Threipsmuir Reservoir.</p>\n<p>\nThe trails can get a big wet and boggy, but it feels like you have been dropped into the highlands of Scotland with heather hills all around and compete emptiness, before being rewarded with a fast road descent to South Queensferry and into Damleny estate, with some great fun single track along the front of the First of Forth.</p>\n<p>Riding the route a couple of times has meant so much to me, as it has allowed me to have big adventures, whilst not being able to travel far from home.</p>\n<p>It is a complete circumnavigation of my home county, feeling like I am in the wilds of remote Scotland yet in reality never being more than 10 miles from home as the crow flies.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/05/mark_beaumont_doorstep_ride_04.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>It has allowed me to see ‘home’, and the familiar, in a very new and unfamiliar way – and by sharing #exploreyourboundaries on Komoot, I have loved seeing many other people also explore the route, sharing their highlights and photos.</p>\n<p>I would suggest that a decent fitness level is needed to tackle this route, or else splitting it into two days, if the whole 65 miles is a bit intimidating in one go.</p>\n<p>But for anyone visiting Scotland’s capital, this should become a bucket list ride, it really does showcase Edinburgh and its surrounding countryside in such a fantastic way.</p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/destinations\">Destinations</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e992183804c0cf9db88f37eedb968d20e7778e23d314e43dc42fc1f8d2c2b8b9","category":"Cycling"}
