Along with Road insertion tubes, today Dynaplug also announces the launch of Road plugs – substantially shorter than standard plugs. The smaller size means the excess plug will not rub against the frame or fork on tighter clearances Road or All Road frames.</p>\n<p>The Dynaplug® Carbon Road Racer is the lightest tire plugging tool in the world at 14 grams, making it an ideal companion for weight-conscious road cyclists. With its small form factor, it can be neatly stowed on your bike (with included mount), saddlebag, or jersey pocket. For those that salivate at the sight of compact, well-made US components, the Dynaplug® Carbon Road Racer Kit is now optimized with Road length insertion tubes scaled for Road tires and compatible with both shorter Road and standard soft tips repair plugs.</p>\n<p>Dynaplug® Carbon Road Racer Kit Includes:</p>\n<p>1 – Dynaplug® Carbon Racer – Road<br />\n5 – Standard Soft Nose Plugs<br />\n1 – Pipe cleaner<br />\n1 – Cage Mount Silicone Holder<br />\n$47.99 MSRP<br />\nWeight: 14 grams</p>\n<p>In stock now at <a href=\"http://www.dynaplug.com/bicycles.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dynaplug</a> and your local dealer.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"745a2c27aaba9b626b1ef0e9430c65e3a15a9fe39808833c016d5c39e770fb5e","category":"Cycling"}
