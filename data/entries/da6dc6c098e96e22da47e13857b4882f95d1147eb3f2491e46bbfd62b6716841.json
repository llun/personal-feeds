There are also other comfort improvements that have been made possible by reducing the size of each individual bud, such as a shortened in-ear tip and reduced external height for a more flush fit.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNoise cancellation is said to be twice as good as the previous model and the buds now feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> Pro-style sound passthrough mode. Sound quality has also been improved with extended dynamic range and increased base and treble fidelity. The microphones are also improved for better call quality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe second-gen Echo Buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, and the earbuds can deliver five hours of listening with noise cancellation enabled, with two additional full charges in the case for a total of 15 hours. Like the original Echo Buds, the second-generation model comes with Alexa built-in.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-black.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Echo Buds come with four sizes of oval-shaped ear tips and optional wing tips in two sizes for a more secure fit.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe second-generation Echo Buds are priced at $119.99 with the standard USB-C charging case, or $139.99 with the wireless charging case, undercutting the $249 price of ‌AirPods Pro‌ considerably. They will go on sale on May 13 and will be discounted for a limited time to $99.99 and $119.99.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-echo/\">Amazon Echo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/new-amazon-echo-buds-take-on-airpods-pro/\">New Amazon Echo Buds Take on AirPods Pro With Improved Design and Better Noise Cancellation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-amazon-echo-buds-take-on-airpods-pro-with-improved-design-and-better-noise-cancellation.2291679/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hJJ9Y3R25dQ:2AzWlNeKyRA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hJJ9Y3R25dQ:2AzWlNeKyRA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hJJ9Y3R25dQ\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"da6dc6c098e96e22da47e13857b4882f95d1147eb3f2491e46bbfd62b6716841","category":"Apple"}
