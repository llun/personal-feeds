Samsung already offered multiple smartphones with screen sizes at or beyond the 5-inch mark at the time.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/\">Wedbush</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/2021-iphone-sales-forecast-wedbush/\">Apple Forecasted to Sell Record-Breaking 240+ Million iPhones in 2021</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-forecasted-to-sell-record-breaking-240-million-iphones-in-2021.2290910/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sS0EkcHzNIQ:j80g3ZC5aPE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=sS0EkcHzNIQ:j80g3ZC5aPE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/sS0EkcHzNIQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"96e8df5b063d5e72820b59a24aaf515d731d69aa1ededdc6a63efc7a2a9a64b0","category":"Apple"}
