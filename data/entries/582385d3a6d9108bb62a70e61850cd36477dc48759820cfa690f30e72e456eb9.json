Today's offer is the first new deal we've tracked on the accessory since that time, and it's the lowest price Amazon has offered.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWR2NXZ?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$16.55 OFF</div>MagSafe Duo for $112.45</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMagSafe Duo launched in December 2020 and offers a ‌MagSafe‌ charging puck for the ‌iPhone 12‌, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, and 12 mini, along with an Apple Watch charger. The ‌MagSafe‌ Duo features a foldable design for easier portability, and it ships with a USB-C to Lightning cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlso on sale is the regular MagSafe Charger, available for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L5NP6NG?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$34.00</strong></a>, down from $39.00. Although just $5 off, this is the best price we've tracked on the Apple first-party accessory. MagSafe maintains compatibility with Qi charging, so it can be used to wirelessly charge an iPhone 8 or later, and even AirPods.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBe sure to visit our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to shop for even more Apple-related products and accessories.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/deals-magsafe-duo-charger-drops/\">Deals: MagSafe Duo Charger Drops to $112.45 on Amazon ($16.55 Off)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-magsafe-duo-charger-drops-to-112-45-on-amazon-16-55-off.2291933/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9EU6ciZGaRc:XHZVrRcCcQk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9EU6ciZGaRc:XHZVrRcCcQk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9EU6ciZGaRc\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"582385d3a6d9108bb62a70e61850cd36477dc48759820cfa690f30e72e456eb9","category":"Apple"}
