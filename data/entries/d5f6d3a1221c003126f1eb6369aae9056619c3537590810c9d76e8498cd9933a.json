The funky game title has been hinted to in prior 2D games, and years later, Nintendo itself confirmed it was the name of an in-development 2D game that was eventually canceled. Thus, <em>Dread</em>'s return today as an official game name makes it a particularly juicy Easter egg for anyone who's been following the lore of space bounty hunter Samus Aran in her journey to eradicate the Metroid scourge.</p>\n<p>As a fully 2D Metroid game, <em>Metroid Dread</em> resembles <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/metroid-samus-returns-is-a-return-to-form-for-2d-adventuring/\">2017's <em>Metroid: Samus Returns</em></a>, a modern 2D remake of the Game Boy classic <em>Return of Samus</em>. Not just in perspective or aesthetics, either: This year's new <em>Metroid</em> sequel includes that 2017 game's melee-swipe ability—and in kind, Nintendo has confirmed that the 2017 game's developers at MercurySteam are involved this time, as well. Unsurprisingly, as a <em>Metroid</em> series sequel, it also includes new and trippy abilities like a cloak shield—and a few entirely new alien foes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773518#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773518&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5f6d3a1221c003126f1eb6369aae9056619c3537590810c9d76e8498cd9933a","category":"Tech"}
