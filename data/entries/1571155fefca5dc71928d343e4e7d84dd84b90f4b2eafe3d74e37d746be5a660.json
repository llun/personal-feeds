Check it out in detail below!</em><span></span></p>\n<p>My Mosaic was the culmination of saving bits and pieces of extra cash throughout my 4 years of college, as well as being funded by the sale of my beloved caad12. I had previously only ridden aluminum bikes with mechanical Shimano 105 10-speed, so when this used Mosaic came into my hands it was like stepping into a whole new world of cycling.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_3991.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Yes, this bike has some nicks and scratches. It has mismatched carbon wheels that I had leftover from previous bikes. It has a broken bottle cage, mismatched finishing kit, and an amazon garmin mount.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_3982-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_3989.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I love it. It is my dream bike that I saved years for, worked hard for, and built up from a used frame. I wouldn’t trade it for a new Tarmac SL-7 or some other generic carbon offering that may save me a few lbs or watts. I race this bike, explore on this bike, get lost and found on this bike, and remember why I ride when I ride this bike.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_3979-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_3978-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The welds! The internal routing! The slammed stem! It’s a Mosaic and it’s beautiful!<br />\nI often pinch myself when I remember that I am a 23-year-old on food stamps and I own this bike. I have strange priorities I guess.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/IMG_3971-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Build Details: </strong><br />\nShimano Ultegra R8050 Di2 rim brake<br />\nShimano Ultegra compact crankset<br />\nShimano 105 11-28 cassette<br />\nReynolds assault carbon front wheel– Not sure of year, but it’s old.<br />\nNovember Rail rear wheel with White Industries T11 hub<br />\nContinental GP5000 25c tires<br />\nZipp service course bar and stem<br />\nBontrager carbon post<br />\nShimano Pro Stealth saddle<br />\nShimano R550 pedals</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
