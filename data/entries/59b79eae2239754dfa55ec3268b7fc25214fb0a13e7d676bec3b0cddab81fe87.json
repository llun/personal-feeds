{"title":"AWS DeepRacer League’s 2021 Season Launches With New Open and Pro Divisions","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepracer-leagues-2021-season-launches-with-new-open-and-pro-divisions/","date":1614630200000,"content":"<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-50393 size-full\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/02/17/dr_hero_3.png\" alt=\"AWS DeepRacer League Logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"167\" />As a developer, I have been hearing a lot of stories lately about how companies have solved their business problems using machine learning (ML), so one of my goals for 2021 is to learn more about it.</p> \n<p>For the last few years I have been using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/ai-services/\">artificial intelligence (AI) services</a> such as, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/\" title=\"\">Amazon Rekognition</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/\" title=\"\">Amazon Comprehend</a>, and others extensively. AI services provide a simple API to solve common ML problems such as image recognition, text to speech, and analysis of sentiment in a text. When using these high-level APIs, you don’t need to understand how the underlying ML model works, nor do you have to train it, or maintain it in any way.</p> \n<p>Even though those services are great and I can solve most of my business cases with them, I want to understand how ML algorithms work, and that is how I started tinkering with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a>, a service that helps you learn reinforcement learning (RL), has been around <a href=\"/blogs/aws/aws-deepracer-go-hands-on-with-reinforcement-learning-at-reinvent/\">since 2018</a>. RL is an advanced ML technique that takes a very different approach to training models than other ML methods. Basically, it can learn very complex behavior without requiring any labeled training data, and it can make short-term decisions while optimizing for a long-term goal.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test RL models by racing virtually in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> console or physically on a track at AWS and customer events. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> is for developers of all skill levels, even if you don’t have any ML experience. When learning RL using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a>, you can take part in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/league/\">AWS DeepRacer League</a> where you get experience with machine learning in a fun and competitive environment.</p> \n<p>Over the past year, the AWS DeepRacer League’s races have <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-aws-deepracer-league-virtual-circuit-is-now-open-train-your-model-today/\">gone completely virtual</a> and participants have competed for different kinds of prizes. However, the competition has become dominated by experts and newcomers haven’t had much of a chance to win.</p> \n<p>The 2021 season introduces new skill-based Open and Pro racing divisions, where racers of all skill levels have five times more opportunities to win rewards than in previous seasons.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/02/25/leagues-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-50491 size-full\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2021/02/25/leagues-2.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the leagues in the console\" width=\"2272\" height=\"1346\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>How the New <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> Racing Divisions Work</strong></p> \n<p>The 2021 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> league runs from March 1 through the end of October. When it kicks off, all participants will enter the Open division, a place to have fun and develop your RL knowledge with other community members.</p> \n<p>At the end of every month, the top 10% of the Open division leaderboard will advance to the Pro division for the remainder of the season; they’ll also receive a Pro Welcome kit full of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> swag. Pro division racers can win <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GZSJVL\">DeepRacer Evo cars</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/\" title=\"\">AWS DeepRacer</a> merchandise such as hats and T-shirts.</p> \n<p><iframe title=\"Introducing the AWS DeepRacer League 2021\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsFCWEisRVY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>At the end of every month, the top 16 racers in the Pro division will compete against each other in a live race console. That race will determine who will advance that month to the 2021 Championship Cup at re:Invent 2021.</p> \n<p>The monthly Pro division winner gets an expenses-paid trip to re:Invent 2021 and participates in the Championship Cup to get a chance to win a Machine Learning education sponsorship worth $20k.</p> \n<p>In both divisions, you can collect digital rewards, including vehicle customizations and accessories which will be released to participants once the winners are announced each month.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p>You can start racing in the Open division any time during the 2021 season.
