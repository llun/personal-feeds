But in this instance a conversation with the new lad Ronan via Slack about how blooming cold it gets in northern Europe got me wondering about the good old days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronan and I both hail from the chillier parts of the United Kingdom, Ronan from Northern Ireland and I from the Lake District, if it wasn&#8217;t for a large gulf of water between the two of us, we could have been training buddies back in our racing days. Anyway, this is a long-winded way around stating that we have trained and raced in some crappy winter weather over the years. And with that, we&#8217;ve had to learn what kit works and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>We both came to the conclusion that most of today&#8217;s cycle clothing is superb, a world away from what we had to deck ourselves out in as kids—all but one single item, the humble trade team winter cap.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"907\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136-1340x907.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-480917\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136-1340x907.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136-650x440.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136-190x129.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136-1080x731.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136-16x11.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CORVOS_00032206-136.jpg 1478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Just look how cool that car is. You know the D.S is shouting some quality abuse/advice at him, which in todays age would haven&#8217;t been caught on camera due to them damn race radios.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s right; we decided that the sole item no brand in this day and age has managed to surpass in quality is the simple winter cap. If you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re on about well that doesn&#8217;t surprise me as they&#8217;re like hen&#8217;s teeth, so hard to get hold of because we&#8217;re sure they don&#8217;t make them any more — instead, it&#8217;s all fancy material this, Gore-Tex that, and clever panel layouts. Far too much tech for one simple item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From this whinging and whining Slack conversation it got me wondering, was cycling better back in the day? Have we been led down a road where cycling doesn&#8217;t quite live up to what it used to be, what it should be? Or are things today far rosier than before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simple answer is obviously a big old &#8220;no&#8221;. Cycling was great then and is great now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that didn&#8217;t stop me from coming up with a few things that definitely (maybe?) were way superior back in the day. So here we have it a top ten, a count down of cycling stuff that was better when it was made of wool and shot on film. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and before anyone takes this too seriously, I may not be 100% behind all my own &#8220;opinions&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/was-cycling-better-back-in-the-day/\">Was cycling better back in the day?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"83552278598a0bf5dc29e7250e2420c1aad878bedbf852430461063d18774926","category":"Cycling"}
