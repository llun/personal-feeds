Apple has not provided an exact delivery date to those who ordered a new ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌, but the tablets will start delivering on May 21.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-preparing-to-ship.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nMany users who preordered early received estimated delivery dates ranging from May 21 to May 28, and if orders ship out as early as this week, some users will indeed receive their tablets on the May 21 date.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOrders that have shifted over to Preparing to Ship are no longer able to be canceled, though the products can be returned once delivered.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌M1‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> models and the second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K orders that were placed at the same time could also soon shift to a Preparing to Shift status, though we're not seeing reports about them just yet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSupplies of the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ have been constrained, and orders placed now have delivery estimates ranging into July. 11-inch models are easier to come by, with Apple planning to deliver new orders in late May or early June.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ models are identical to the previous-generation ‌iPad Pro‌ models in design, but inside, they're equipped with the same ‌M1‌ chip that's in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, plus they support Thunderbolt connectivity. The 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ also has a mini-LED \"Liquid Retina XDR\" display that makes the device slightly thicker. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPricing on the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $799, while pricing on the higher-end 12.9-inch model starts at $1099.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/11/m1-ipad-pro-preparing-to-ship/\">Early M1 iPad Pro Orders Now Preparing to Ship</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/early-m1-ipad-pro-orders-now-preparing-to-ship.2295736/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CJhhzWg1CcI:I_yFqvc1IVQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CJhhzWg1CcI:I_yFqvc1IVQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CJhhzWg1CcI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"13b66dcafc21712a676b232c9e83594528cbc8d543f9e6767f0df181af1a0c7e","category":"Apple"}
