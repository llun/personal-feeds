The new remote is also compatible with the previous-generation Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD. Apple also continues to sell the Apple TV HD with 32GB of storage for $149, and orders placed from today onwards will include the new Siri Remote.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe all-new Siri Remote features a physical clickpad control that offers five-way navigation, and it is also touch-enabled for swipe gestures that Apple TV users are already familiar with. The new Siri Remote also has a power button that controls a TV's power, and another for mute, making it the only remote needed while watching TV.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also announced that Siri now works on Apple TV in Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Apple TV 4K can be ordered starting Friday, April 30, with availability beginning at some point in the second half of May in the United States and more than 30 countries and regions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>This story was part of our live coverage of Apple's ongoing \"Spring Loaded\" event today. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-event-live-coverage-april-2021/\">Read our live blog</a> for a recap of other announcements.</strong><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/april-2021-event/\">April 2021 event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-apple-tv-siri-remote/\">New Apple TV Ships With Redesigned Siri Remote, Also Sold Separately for $59</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-ships-with-redesigned-siri-remote-also-sold-separately-for-59.2292329/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LMSLAgmZyf0:ADalBoxpYgY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LMSLAgmZyf0:ADalBoxpYgY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LMSLAgmZyf0\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1d0ec26ff2c3db1997f2a969026d3309f0a4904b9b533cc2a44c26f76789f601","category":"Apple"}
