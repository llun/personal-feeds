Ribble’s BikeBuilder tool also offers the option to customise many parts of the spec too, so each bike can be built up exactly how you want it.</p>\n<h2>2021 Ribble Gravel AL</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Gravel AL is the cheapest bike in the new Ribble range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<p>The Gravel AL combines a 6061 T6 heat-treated aluminum frame with a full carbon fork. The frame also gets smoothed-out welds for a more premium finish.</p>\n<p>Cables route semi-internally through the frame and fork, and the bike has four sets of mounts on the frame’s main triangle, as well as mounts on the fork.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The frameset looks super premium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">Geometry</a> is progressive and in line with current gravel bike trends, with a size medium having a long, 570mm top tube, a relatively slack 71.5 degrees head tube angle and a 73.5 degree seat tube angle. This adds up to a stack of 584mm and a reach of 397.2mm.</p>\n<p>Available as a frameset or in three builds with Shimano GRX drivetrains, 650b alloy wheels and components by Level (Ribble’s in-house component brand) and WTB Sendero tyres, prices for complete builds start at £1,599.</p>\n<h3>2021 Ribble Gravel AL builds and prices</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Prices start at £1,599 for the Gravel AL Sport.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Ribble Gravel AL – Sport</strong>; Shimano GRX RX400 2×11 groupset; Level Gravel alloy 650b wheels; £1,599</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel AL – Enthusiast;</strong> Shimano GRX RX600 1×11-groupset; Level Gravel alloy 650b wheels; £1,899</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel AL – Pro</strong>; Shimano GRX RX810 1×11 groupset; Level Gravel alloy 650b wheels; £2,399</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel AL frameset</strong>; £699</li>\n</ul><h2>2021 Ribble Gravel SL</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SL jumps up to a carbon frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<p>The raciest bike of the bunch, the Gravel SL features a full carbon frame and fork. Said to be lightweight yet still robust, the Gravel SL also gets aero-profiled tubes similar to those found on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/ribble-endurance-sl-disc/\" target=\"_blank\">Ribble’s Endurance SL Disc road bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Visually, the frameset appears to be very similar to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/ribble-cgr-sl-sram-etap-hrd-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Ribble’s CGR SL gravel bike</a>, though those bikes were typically built with more road-focused groupsets.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s possible to run fully internally routed cables on this bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<p>Cables can be routed semi-externally through the frame fork, but can also be run fully internally through the headset when using the Level 5 carbon integrated handlebar system (which is specced on the two most expensive builds).</p>\n<p>The geometry is slightly less progressive than with the Gravel AL, with a size medium having a more road-like 555mm top tube. The head tube and seat tube angles are otherwise the same though, sitting at 71.5 and 73.5 degrees respectively. This gives a stack of 561mm and a reach of 379mm.</p>\n<p>Available as a frameset or in four builds with Shimano GRX or Campagnolo Ekar drivetrains, Level components, a variety of wheels and WTB Sendero or WTB Riddler tyres, prices for complete builds start at £2,399.</p>\n<h3>2021 Ribble Gravel SL builds and prices</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Prices start at £2,399 for complete bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ribble</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Ribble Gravel SL – Sport</strong>; Shimano GRX RX600 1×11 groupset; Level Gravel alloy 650b wheels; £2,399</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel SL – Enthusiast</strong>; Shimano GRX RX810 1×11-groupset; Level Gravel alloy 650b wheels; £2,899</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel SL – Ekar</strong>; Campagnolo EKAR 1×13 groupset; Hope 20FIVE-RS4 700C wheels; WTB Riddler 45mm tyres; £4,099</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel SL – Pro</strong>; Shimano GRX RX815 Di2 1×11 groupset; Level Level DB Sport carbon 650b wheels; £4,199</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Gravel SL framese</strong>t; £1,399</li>\n</ul><h2>Ribble Gravel Ti</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The titanium version of the bike has also been updated.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Ribble Ti features a 3Al/2.5V titanium frame paired with a full carbon fork.
