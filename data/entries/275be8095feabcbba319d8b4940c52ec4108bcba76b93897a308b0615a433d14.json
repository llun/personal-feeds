Days after his inauguration, he <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/biden-vows-to-electrify-the-federal-governments-600000-vehicle-fleet/\">vowed</a> to replace hundreds of thousands of federal civilian vehicles with electric versions. On Tuesday, Biden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samjmintz/status/1366905797733724161\">held a virtual meeting</a> with CEOs from companies building charging infrastructure. The administration has <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/483154/president-biden-plan-ev-charging-infrastructure/\">set a goal</a> to build more than 500,000 new electric vehicle charging stations by 2030.</p>\n<p>Also on Tuesday, a coalition of six electric utilitiesÂ <a href=\"https://www.aep.com/news/releases/read/6036/AEP,-Five-Others-Plan-to-Add-EV-Fast-Chargers-Creating-Electric-Highway-Coalition\">announced a new initiative</a> that will help Biden achieve his goal. The companies are planning to build a \"seamless network of charging stations\" in and around the American South. The group plans to build chargers near major highways in every southern state, stretching as far west as Texas and as far north as Indiana, Ohio, and Virginia.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_1614702097838.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_1614702097838-640x351.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_1614702097838.jpg 2x\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/img_1614702097838.jpg\" class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> (credit: American Electric Power)</p></div>\n<p>This is not a joint venture. Each utility will build and run its own charging stations. But the goal is to make them appear to the customer as a unified network.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746674#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746674&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
