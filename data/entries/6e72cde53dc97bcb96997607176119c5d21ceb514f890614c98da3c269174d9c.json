According to Apple, ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware betas will allow for the development of certain features on iOS and macOS and will enable features such as Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Pre-release ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware for Apple Developer Program members will be available at a future date. This will allow development of features on iOS and macOS for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> as well as enable new features, including Conversation Boost (beam forming) and Ambient Noise Reduction (noise suppressor).</blockquote>Currently, Apple occasionally releases firmware updates for ‌AirPods‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, although there's no reliable way to manually update the devices. Instead, they're <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/update-airpods/\">updated automatically</a> when connected to power and nearby a paired <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with an internet connection. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt remains unclear how Apple will provide beta versions for ‌AirPods Pro‌ firmware. Presumably, Apple will provide a profile for developers to download that automatically installs and updates the ‌AirPods Pro‌ when there's a new update. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/airpods-pro-firmware-betas-for-developers/\">Apple to Offer Beta Versions of AirPods Pro Firmware for Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-offer-beta-versions-of-airpods-pro-firmware-for-developers.2300254/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=b5DIPugDozQ:hacdIJ7gsTk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=b5DIPugDozQ:hacdIJ7gsTk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/b5DIPugDozQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e72cde53dc97bcb96997607176119c5d21ceb514f890614c98da3c269174d9c","category":"Apple"}
