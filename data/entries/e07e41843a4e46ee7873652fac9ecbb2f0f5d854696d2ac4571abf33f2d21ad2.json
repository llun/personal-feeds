The other vision bets on a fleet of a few dozen supersonic airliners jetting well-heeled travelers from one global city to another, a dream that many thought died with the Concorde some 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Oddly, it's the flying cars that seem closer to reality this time. Yesterday, Joby Aviation announced another step in its plan to bring <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/06/are-flying-cars-about-to-become-a-real-thing-starburst-accelerator-thinks-they-are/\">eVTOL</a> services to the masses. The company has signed an agreement with two real estate companies, Neighborhood Property Group and Reef Technology (the latter is a sort of WeWork for non-office commercial real estate), to allow rooftop access to Reef’s 5,000 parking garages in the US and Europe. By comparison, there are about <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160202065204/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/01/22/public-use-heliports-like-one-pondered-boston-are-rare-nationally/wnwxtvevXEE8uPIsll8uHJ/story.html\">5,600 US heliports</a>, which are managed by a patchwork of owners.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769545#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769545&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e07e41843a4e46ee7873652fac9ecbb2f0f5d854696d2ac4571abf33f2d21ad2","category":"Tech"}
