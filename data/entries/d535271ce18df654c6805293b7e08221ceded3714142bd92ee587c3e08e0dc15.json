Unlike Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Thread standard doesn't depend on a router or hub. Instead, the smart device itself extends the network by talking to other Thread-enabled devices, thereby boosting the signal between them.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> and the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K act as Thread border routers, and by adding Thread-supported devices around the home, users can typically expect improved connectivity compared to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, a wider control range, and more remote scheduling options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Nanoleaf Thread border router support also means Android users will be able to control the Essentials devices, too. Other devices that work with Thread include smart home products from Eve, the Nest Hub Max, and Nest Wi-Fi by Google.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nanoleaf-turns-on-thread-border-routers-for-easier-smart-home-control-4149911?utm_source=keystone&amp;utm_medium=keystone_core_reviews_rss&amp;utm_campaign=trusted+reviews\">Trusted Reviews</a>.)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nanoleaf/\">Nanoleaf</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thread/\">Thread</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/08/nanoleaf-thread-shapes-elements-light-panels/\">Nanoleaf Adds Thread Border Router Support to Shapes and Elements Light Panels</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nanoleaf-adds-thread-border-router-support-to-shapes-and-elements-light-panels.2303590/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S10g0Y-agAE:h2mch2p9CU0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S10g0Y-agAE:h2mch2p9CU0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/S10g0Y-agAE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d535271ce18df654c6805293b7e08221ceded3714142bd92ee587c3e08e0dc15","category":"Apple"}
