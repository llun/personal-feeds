{"title":"Twitter Considers Letting Users Tweet to 'Trusted Friends'","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/02/twitter-design-concept-trusted-friends/","date":1625216349000,"content":"Twitter is considering letting users post select tweets for \"Trusted Friends\" only. That's the name of a feature the social media platform is testing that would allow users to limit the audience for specific content to a smaller circle of people.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/trustedfriends-full.png.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on design concepts shared by the company (via <em><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-considers-new-features-for-tweeting-only-to-friends-under-different-personas-and-more/\">TechCrunch</a></em>), Trusted Friends could be a toggle that lets you indicate whether a tweet should be made public or be shown to just a handful of users. The idea is similar to Instagram's \"Close Friends\" feature, which lets users share personal Stories more privately. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBringing the option to Twitter would allow users who have multiple Twitter accounts separating their personal and professional lives to tweet from a single account and have greater control of who sees what on their timeline. It could also mean some users no longer have to toggle between public and protected tweets.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTwitter recently announced new ways for creators and influencers to deliver content to specific users who pay to access its \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/twitter-super-follow-feature-announced/\">Super Follow</a>\" feature, and Trusted Friends feels like an experimental extension of the idea that would be available to all users. But it's just a concept for now, and there's no guarantee Twitter will ever take it live.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther concepts Twitter says it is looking into include \"Facets,\" which would give other users the ability to choose whether they wanted to follow all a user's tweets, or only those about the \"facet\" they're interested in, and an ability for users to list specific phrases that they don't want to see in replies. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs with Trusted Friends, neither of these features are currently in active development and Twitter is simply seeking feedback to gauge whether they're worth pursuing or not.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/02/twitter-design-concept-trusted-friends/\">Twitter Considers Letting Users Tweet to 'Trusted Friends'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/twitter-considers-letting-users-tweet-to-trusted-friends.2302995/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9CgVIi8g8KA:6TJDxCot2w4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9CgVIi8g8KA:6TJDxCot2w4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9CgVIi8g8KA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c19d250c3fb69a6081764c18c5466aa34aedb2f4b43220c3296b55c427e0b4a","category":"Apple"}
