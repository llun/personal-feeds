Google said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-ios-apps-privacy-labels-update/\">in early January</a> that it would add privacy data to its app catalog \"this week or next week,\" but by January 20, most apps still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/google-ios-apps-still-no-privacy-labels/\">had not been updated</a> with the App Privacy.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle has since been adding App Privacy labels to apps like YouTube and some of its smaller apps, but of major apps like Google Search, Google <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, and Google Maps, Gmail is the first to get the new labeling.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere is nothing hugely unexpected in the Gmail App Privacy data, with Google listing location, user ID, and usage data as information that's shared with third-party advertisers.Purchases, location, contact info, user content, search history, identifiers, and usage data are used for analytics purposes, product personalization, and app functionality.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThough most Google apps went months without an update and still have yet to be updated, apps like Google Translate, Google Tasks, YouTube Music, and YouTube TV have been updated with new content and bug fixes. These apps were quietly updated with App Privacy labels prior to when their content was updated, however.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNow that Gmail has App Privacy labels in place, we may soon see the information made available for other Google apps, and Google may resume the regular updates that were offered for iOS apps prior to when Apple implemented the new rules.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gmail/\">Gmail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/\">Google Finally Adds App Privacy Labels to Gmail App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-finally-adds-app-privacy-labels-to-gmail-app.2285821/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=acLpm30S1Ng:LIiXb1oraks:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=acLpm30S1Ng:LIiXb1oraks:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/acLpm30S1Ng\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b8d877eda0b9da6d60847e7134024d1fdda32e4df318722d20ecf583c77a8b91","category":"Apple"}
