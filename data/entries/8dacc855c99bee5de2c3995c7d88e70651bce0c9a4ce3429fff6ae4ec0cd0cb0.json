The keyboard is available in white for both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ for $299 and $349.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/new-12-9-ipad-pro-previous-magic-keyboard/\">New 12.9-inch iPad Pro 'Works Perfect' With Previous Generation Magic Keyboard, But Fit is a 'Little Bit Snug'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-works-perfect-with-previous-generation-magic-keyboard-but-fit-is-a-little-bit-snug.2296773/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=q54DEdwrMJM:odrBS8OewIU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=q54DEdwrMJM:odrBS8OewIU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/q54DEdwrMJM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8dacc855c99bee5de2c3995c7d88e70651bce0c9a4ce3429fff6ae4ec0cd0cb0","category":"Apple"}
