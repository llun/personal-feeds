The exchange rate with the dollar will be set by the market, and exchanges from dollars to bitcoin won’t be subject to capital gains tax. The law was passed by a supermajority vote of the legislature, with 62 of 84 deputies assenting.</p>\n<p>President Nayib Bukele said the new law would make it easier for Salvadorans living abroad to send remittances back to friends and family in the country. Some <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b\">$6 billion</a> in remittances flowed into the Salvadoran economy last year, accounting for nearly a quarter of the country’s gross domestic product. Around 70 percent of Salvadorans lack access to traditional banking and other financial services within the country, the president said. The 39-year-old leader hopes that sending remittances will become cheaper, too. Last year, the average fee was <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.RMT.COST.IB.ZS?locations=SV\">3 percent per transaction</a>. Eliminating that fee would net Salvadorans an additional $180 million.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771727#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771727&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4fe12e0abb3364bda74f4c6cfd761106f84f4d2f8b3ed704331f1be84de756c5","category":"Tech"}
