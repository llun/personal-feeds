Type to Siri and support for both fraction and integer formats (23.976fps or 24.000fps) are nice improvements. &#129525; <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/To8vg9vXbk&amp;xcust=1-1-340537-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://t.co/To8vg9vXbk</a></p>&mdash; Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1374450750852538372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-340537-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">March 23, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></figure><p>This could be Apple simply cleaning up its language so it&rsquo;s more appropriate to the situation, as in some countries Siri functionality isn&rsquo;t available. But Apple also likes to make such changes when new hardware is coming, and there have been rumors that new Apple TV hardware could be available this year. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230596/apple-tv-4k-review.html\">Apple TV 4K</a> was originally released in September 2017, and the Apple TV HD made its debut two years earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Moser has also found <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/&amp;xcust=1-1-340537-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FaceTime and iMessage frameworks</a> in the code as well as a new AVFCapture framework related to capturing images. That could mean a HomePod with a microphone, speaker, and camera are on the way, or one with the potential to tap into third-party cameras. The current tvOS only supports FaceTime via AirPlay streaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moser has a Twitter thread that points out other changes in tvOS 14.5, including a &ldquo;Type to Siri&rdquo; feature, support for &ldquo;Other Wireless Speakers,&rdquo; and a redesigned Podcasts section. Other features that have been revealed in earlier betas of tvOS 14.5 include support for the latest PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X controllers and a change of the&nbsp;refresh rates settings&nbsp;from&nbsp;30Hz and 60Hz to the more specific 29.97Hz and 59.94Hz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible some of these references are related to HomePod, as the two devices share a common OS. Bloomberg&rsquo;s Mark Gurman recently reported that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/&amp;xcust=1-1-340537-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple was developing a new HomePod</a> with displays and cameras to take on the <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3611170/amazon-echo-show-10-review.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3611170/amazon-echo-show-10-review.html\">Echo Show</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3446738/google-nest-hub-max-review.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3446738/google-nest-hub-max-review.html\">Google Nest Hub</a> devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Apple TV is rumored to arrive this year, possible as soon as April alongside new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/339942/three-features-that-make-the-next-ipad-pro-a-true-pro-tablet.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/339942/three-features-that-make-the-next-ipad-pro-a-true-pro-tablet.html\">iPad Pros</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229316/airpods-faq-price-features-how-to-tips.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229316/airpods-faq-price-features-how-to-tips.html\">AirPods</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234037/apple-airtags-bluetooth-track-find-my-ultrawide-band-u1-keychain-locate-lost-items.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234037/apple-airtags-bluetooth-track-find-my-ultrawide-band-u1-keychain-locate-lost-items.html\">AirTags</a>.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"How to find every troubleshooting boot mode on an M1 Mac","siteHash":"571ea43fe004bc02f251ac5579f1cc8c2ae12ee00438b240fba4bd5d422d587a","entryHash":"2b3b944dd5d8bc4a17d2008c1388d37f37bca67c79c5df38920ecdb8cbe3eb46","category":"Apple"}
