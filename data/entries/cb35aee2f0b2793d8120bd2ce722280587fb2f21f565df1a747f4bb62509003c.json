After opening at 44.70 that morning, the price shot up from $52.41 at 3pm to $91.71 just before the market closed at 4pm.</p>\n<p>That 75 percent increase in a single hour was followed shortly after by a peak price of $200 in post-market trading Wednesday evening. As of this writing, the stock is currently selling at about $132 in highly volatile early market trading.</p>\n<p>The sudden surge obviously brings to mind GameStop's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/\">similarly quick stock price run-up</a> in late January.
