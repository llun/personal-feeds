Hanks stars as Finch, a robotics engineer who has lived in an underground bunker for a decade after being one of the few survivors of a \"cataclysmic solar event\" that has left the world a wasteland, the report explains.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFinch creates a robot (played by \"Get Out\" actor Caleb Landry Jones) to watch over his dog Goodyear when he no longer can. The trio is said to embark on a \"perilous journey into a desolate American West\" as Finch discovers the joy of being alive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe film is directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who \"helmed some of the most ambitious episodes of Game of Thrones,\" according to the report. It will be the second film starring Hanks to debut on Apple TV+ after \"Greyhound\" last year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Apple also <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/05/apple-original-comedy-mr-corman-created-by-directed-by-and-starring-joseph-gordon-levitt-to-make-global-debut-friday-aug-6-on-apple-tv/\">announced</a> today that comedy series \"Mr. Corman,\" created by, directed by, and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, will make its global debut on Apple TV+ on Friday, August 6.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/tom-hanks-finch-apple-tv-plus-film/\">Tom Hanks to Star in Sci-Fi Film 'Finch' Headed to Apple TV+ Later This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tom-hanks-to-star-in-sci-fi-film-finch-headed-to-apple-tv-later-this-year.2294656/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZhuE7i_ut5k:p6W6mHc9Xgw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZhuE7i_ut5k:p6W6mHc9Xgw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZhuE7i_ut5k\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8ee9ab8195c70b7b5074de922adf21146c3098b7d7ac3829495866ef3e3a803e","category":"Apple"}
