Apple is already sending out over-the-air updates to ‌AirTags‌ that will shorten the amount of time before an unknown AirTag alerts you if it is in your possession.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/airtag-in-hand.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the current time, ‌AirTags‌ play a sound after three days of being away from their owner. After the update, ‌AirTags‌ will begin playing at a random time in a window after eight hours and within 24 hours.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also working to create an app for Android devices that will let them detect an unknown AirTag or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> network-enabled item that is found to be traveling with them, which will prevent ‌AirTags‌ from being used to stalk Android users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirTags‌ are designed to play a sound when away from their owner and will also alert <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> owners if there's an unknown tag nearby, but Apple has been criticized because it's anti-stalking measures do not go far enough. <em>The Washington Post</em>'s Geoffrey Fowler in May <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/airtags-anti-stalking-measures-not-sufficient/\">penned an article</a> that outlined how ‌AirTags‌ could be used for covert stalking, and one of his main criticisms was the lack of alerts for ‌iPhone‌ users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHis other critique was that the three-day sound timer on ‌AirTags‌ resets whenever it's near the owner's phone, potentially allowing for spousal abuse and stalking, so Apple is working to address both of these issues.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Android app will be released later this year, and the sound updates for ‌AirTags‌ will be automatically applied when an AirTag is near an ‌iPhone‌.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/apple-airtags-anti-stalking-measures/\">Apple Enhancing AirTags Anti-Stalking Measures With Android App and Shorter Sound Intervals</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-enhancing-airtags-anti-stalking-measures-with-android-app-and-shorter-sound-intervals.2299090/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MlvyfKsHFPs:K2SPUy9Vy1E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MlvyfKsHFPs:K2SPUy9Vy1E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MlvyfKsHFPs\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"87c3bc738d9d9c3b07c4b870f2f4296f1e2a01d899f412e95b891f5e2f4d12c0","category":"Apple"}
