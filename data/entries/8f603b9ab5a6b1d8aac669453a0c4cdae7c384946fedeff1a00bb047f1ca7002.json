The death of legacy Edge was first <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/microsoft-365-apps-say-farewell-to-internet-explorer-11-and/ba-p/1591666\">announced</a> in August 2020, with the end-of-life date set to March 9, 2021—this Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The deprecated version of Edge, originally named <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/microsofts-project-spartan-is-now-called-microsoft-edge/\">Project Spartan</a>, was developed and shipped as Windows 10's default browser in 2015. Unlike the current, Chromium-based Edge, it had no upstream project—the entire browser, up to and including the rendering engine, was a Microsoft design.</p>\n<p>Despite being Windows 10's default browser, Spartan never achieved significant marketshare, let alone the crushing dominance once enjoyed by Internet Explorer. According to <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2019\">GlobalStats</a>, legacy Edge peaked at well below 2.5 percent marketshare—less than, for example, Opera. By contrast, and despite its relative newborn status, Chromium-based Edge has already hit 3.4 percent—closing in on Firefox's much-diminished 3.8 percent, as of February 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748790#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748790&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8f603b9ab5a6b1d8aac669453a0c4cdae7c384946fedeff1a00bb047f1ca7002","category":"Tech"}
