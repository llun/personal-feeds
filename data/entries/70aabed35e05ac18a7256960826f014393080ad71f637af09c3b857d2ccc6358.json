For now, the state's power authority suggests that, rather than restoring power, grid operators will try to shift from <em>complete</em> blackouts to <em>rolling</em> ones. Meanwhile, the state's cold weather is expected to continue for at least another day. How did this happen?</p>\n<p>To understand what's going on in Texas, and how things got so bad, you need quite a bit of arcane knowledge—including everything from weather and history to the details of grid structure and how natural gas contracts are organized. We've gathered details on as much of this as possible, and we also talked to grid expert <a href=\"https://energyenvironment.pnnl.gov/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=1509\">Jeff Dagle</a> at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL). What follows is an attempt to organize and understand an ongoing, and still somewhat chaotic, situation.</p>\n<h2>Why is Texas so much worse off?</h2>\n<p>While other states have seen customers lose power, Texas has been hit the hardest, with far more customers losing power for substantially longer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743386#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743386&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70aabed35e05ac18a7256960826f014393080ad71f637af09c3b857d2ccc6358","category":"Tech"}
