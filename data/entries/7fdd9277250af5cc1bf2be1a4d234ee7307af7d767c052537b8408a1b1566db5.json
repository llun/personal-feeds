Gurman has said that the new &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will be less than half the size of the current ‌&zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;‌, putting it somewhere between the existing ‌&zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;‌ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>. The machine is speculated to feature a mostly aluminum exterior and may \"invoke nostalgia\" for the Power Mac G4 Cube.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nProsser has now said that the new &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will feature a design that looks like \"three to four Mac minis stacked on top of each other,\" and provided renders of the purported new look.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/jon-prosser-mac-pro-mini.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785425\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nInternally, Prosser says that the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; will be designed with the \"compute unit on the bottom\" and a \"big heat sink on top.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLate last year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/02/apple-smaller-mac-pro-apple-silicon/\"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that Apple plans to launch the new, smaller ‌&zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;‌ with ‌&zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj;‌ by the end of 2022, but it could arrive as soon as this year.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/prosser-imac-colors-mac-pro-to-resemble-mac-minis/\">Prosser: 2021 iMac to Come in Five Colors, Apple Silicon Mac Pro to Resemble &#039;Stacked&#039; Mac Minis</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prosser-2021-imac-to-come-in-five-colors-apple-silicon-mac-pro-to-resemble-stacked-mac-minis.2286034/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Uy7a86E9SbM:6nkpzPs2btg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Uy7a86E9SbM:6nkpzPs2btg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Uy7a86E9SbM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fdd9277250af5cc1bf2be1a4d234ee7307af7d767c052537b8408a1b1566db5","category":"Apple"}
