Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/tim-cook-vivatech-conference-interview/\">said in June</a> that the proposed rules around sideloading apps would destroy the security of the ‌iPhone‌ and the privacy initiatives that have been built into the ‌App Store‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn the topic of the DMA, Vestager said that she is open to changes, and that she believes it is possible to \"find solutions,\" but it is likely that Apple will continue to fight heavily against alternate app stores or sideloading apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nVestager also said that she supports Apple's recent App Tracking Transparency privacy changes and has no issue with the functionality because it's an option available to everyone.<blockquote>As I have said, I think actually several times, that it is a good thing when providers give us the service that we can easily set our preferences if we want to be tracked outside the use of an app or not as long as it's the same condition for everyone. So far, we have no reason to believe that this is not the case for Apple.</blockquote>Should the Digital Markets Act go on to become law, Apple will have to make major changes to its ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ platform to accommodate the requirement to allow for non-App Store apps. Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/us-lawmakers-tech-antitrust-legislation/\">facing similar legislation</a> in the United States, with U.S. House lawmakers in June introducing antitrust bills that would result in major changes to the tech industry if passed.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/02/apple-privacy-excuses-limit-competition/\">EU Competition Chief Tells Apple Not to Use Privacy as a Shield Against Competition</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-competition-chief-tells-apple-not-to-use-privacy-as-a-shield-against-competition.2303045/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bxGcI3FzNr4:PMjeSBTgkRc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bxGcI3FzNr4:PMjeSBTgkRc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bxGcI3FzNr4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ba79b8be32074d665783cbbf470caf24ea0e2f964f9d27b6789cc20b83bc2bc","category":"Apple"}
