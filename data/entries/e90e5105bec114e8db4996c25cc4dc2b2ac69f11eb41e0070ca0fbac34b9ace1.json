In a tweet responding to <em>MacRumors</em> editor Joe Rossignol's commentary on a possible March event, Gurman confirmed that the March 16 date is not correct.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Narrator: There won’t end up being one <a href=\"https://t.co/SVAdtzfjqz\">https://t.co/SVAdtzfjqz</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1362929260487344128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn a separate tweet, he said \"launch isn't on the 16th,\" which leaves open the possibility for a March event on a different date.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Launch isn’t on the 16th</p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1362930653583478786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upcoming-apple-products/\">several products in the works</a> that have been rumored for the first half of 2021, including a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, an updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, a new low-cost AirPod, revamped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3, plus we're still waiting on the debut of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSome of these products could indeed be introduced at a spring event, but there is no known date for that event as of yet. Apple does hold March events in most years, but it's not guaranteed. Past spring events have been held on March 9 (2015), March 21 (2016), March 27 (2018), and March 25 (2019), with no event taking place in March 2017 or March 2020.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/no-apple-event-march-16/\">Gurman: No Apple Event Happening on March 16</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-apple-event-happening-on-march-16.2285452/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Kf_badTK_Js:UQ7_P21VCIE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Kf_badTK_Js:UQ7_P21VCIE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Kf_badTK_Js\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e90e5105bec114e8db4996c25cc4dc2b2ac69f11eb41e0070ca0fbac34b9ace1","category":"Apple"}
