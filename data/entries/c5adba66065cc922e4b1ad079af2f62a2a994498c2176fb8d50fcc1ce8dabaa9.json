A gravel bike? Maybe a ‘monstercross’ rig?</p>\n<p>Call it whatever you want. I call it my funky fun Unicorn. This Soma Wolverine build was inspired by Marin County’s beautiful Bolinas Ridge trail. There’s a rad loop from the mountain bike haven of Fairfax. It’s a mix of pavement and dirt, about 45 miles long with 4K feet of climbing. There’s plenty of steep, technical bits that Marin is known for along with rolling country hillsides, grazing cows and yes, even some stretches of proper “gravel,” an elusive surface here in the Bay Area.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_214754930.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_215351376.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I used to ride Bo Ridge on my trusty Surly Cross-Check. It was fun with 700c X 42mm rubber, but I had to slow down to a crawl on the backside descent, which is rutted out double-track best suited for a hardtail. Even taking it slow, this part of ride always left me feeling like a jackpot ball in a pinball machine. I wanted a bike that could make the ride comfortable but also efficiently cover the 20 miles of pavement at the end of the loop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_215423016.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_214459957.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thinking through this was how my Unicorn was born. I sold my Cross-Check last summer to fund the build. The Wolverine takes everything I liked about the Surly and does it better: bigger tire clearance, slacker geometry and disc brakes are the highlights. To maximize the level of rad, I asked Oakland-based frame builder Erik Billings to drill the seat tube for a dropper post and installed the Redshift ShockStop suspension stem, which takes the sting out of mistakes on the trail.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_215004366.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_215101093.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For me, the Wolverine is all the cross-country mountain bike I need. What makes it unusual in this crowded genre is that it can run 2X compact cranks on a standard 68mm bottom bracket shell while *unofficially* clearing 2.1″ tires in the rear. I have tight, narrow hips that are much happier on narrow q-factor road cranks. Unfortunately, most drop-bar 29ers rely on a 73mm shell to clear fat tires and assume the rider will be happy with a 1X setup. I dig 1X for my mountain bike, but I feel a mixed terrain bike is best served with the closer spacing you get with an old-fashioned wide-step double.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_232412368.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I have no doubt that a gravel bike with tires measured in millimeters is a fine machine for backroads all over the world. Here in the Bay Area where mountain biking was born, however, we don’t have much gravel like I see in magazines and Instagram posts. Most trails are what you’d consider cross-country. Think: rocky climbs, washboard fire roads and rutted out descents. Can they be tackled on plumped-up cyclocross tires at ~40psi? Sure. Are they more comfortable and fun on mountain bike tires with the psi dropped down to the 20s? I think so!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_223019690.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_204715056.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My favorite component is Mike Varley’s no-BS Monstercross fork, with its unusual 55mm of rake and triple mounts, shod here with the Tailfin 4-bolt cargo cage. I can’t say enough good things about Nick’s team at Rogue Panda, who worked with me on a custom taper to avoid the knee rub issue I had previously with an off-the-shelf option! My goal this summer is to knock out a couple dirt-focused solo trips while I dream of one day attempting the GDMBR with the Unicorn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_214459957.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I run Wolftooth’s Roadlink for a bikepacking-friendly 17″ granny gear. The fenders are a nod to the Unicorn’s mtb intentions. I’ve found Schwalbe’s new version of the Racing Ralph, which is marketed as a rear-specific XC tire, to be perfect on the front at 2.25″. Oh, and John’s “Shred Lightly” stem cap reminds me that I’m not on my mountain bike! It’s easy to forget aboard the Unicorn, which screams “SEND IT!” at the top of every climb.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210320_221938739.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’d love to see other people’s genre-busting bikes in the comments below. For me, celebrating all that a bike is capable of is more fun than defining what it “should” be.</p>\n<p>Build spec:</p>\n<p>FRAME Soma Wolverine v4 (Type-A) HEAD BADGE Rainbow-barfing unicorn by the amazing Jennifer Green<br />\nFRAME BAG Rogue Panda custom tapered<br />\nRIMS Velocity Blunt SS<br />\nHUBS White Industries<br />\nTIRES Schwalbe Thunder Burt 29 X 2.1″ rear, Racing Ralph 29 X 2.25″ front<br />\nHANDLEBARS Ritchey Venturemax w/ Controltech 20mm extensions<br />\nHEADSET Cane Creek<br />\nCRANKSET Sugino “sub-compact” 40/24 double, 167.5mm<br />\nPEDALS Shimano XT<br />\nCASSETTE Sunrace 11-42 10-speed<br />\nFRONT/REAR DERAILLEUR SRAM<br />\nBRAKES TRP Spyre<br />\nSHIFTERS SRAM Red 2X10<br />\nSADDLE Specialized Phenom<br />\nSEATPOST PNW 110mm dropper (frame custom drilled)<br />\nSTEM Redshift ShockStop 90mm<br />\nCARGO CAGES Tailfin 4-bolt<br />\nOTHER ACCESSORIES PathLessPedaled stickers, Mucky Nutz fenders, Crane Bell, King Cages, Problem Solvers mount for rear taillight, Zefal 1L bottles, Jagwire Pro cabling</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
