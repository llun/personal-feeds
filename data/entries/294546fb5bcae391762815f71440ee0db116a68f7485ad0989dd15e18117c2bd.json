It's set to the song \"Fallin' Apart\" by Young Franco, and it features the tagline \"Turn the world into your playground with &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; ad comes amid rumors of third-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, which could be released as soon as this month. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a> will look similar to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with shorter stems and a smaller case, but will not have the same Active Noise Cancellation functionality.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is also rumored to be working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-2/\">new version of the AirPods Pro</a> that will lack a stem, but it is not yet clear when the new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; might launch.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad/\">Apple Shares &#039;Jump&#039; AirPods Pro Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-jump-airpods-pro-ad.2288325/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5SozCbei-m4:mdOs9EZez9M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5SozCbei-m4:mdOs9EZez9M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5SozCbei-m4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"294546fb5bcae391762815f71440ee0db116a68f7485ad0989dd15e18117c2bd","category":"Apple"}
