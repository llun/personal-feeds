Apple was also accused of failing to replace or repair defective Powerbeats 2 within the one-year warranty period.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe case did not play out in court as Apple agreed to pay $9.75 million last summer to settle the lawsuit. At the time that it agreed to the payout, Apple said that it denied all allegations and was paying the settlement fee to avoid expensive litigation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/powerbeats-settlement.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe settlement was approved in January of 2021, and now the money obtained from Apple is being split between all Class Members <a href=\"https://www.wirelessearphonessettlement.com\">who submitted claim forms</a> after attorneys' fees and related costs were paid.
