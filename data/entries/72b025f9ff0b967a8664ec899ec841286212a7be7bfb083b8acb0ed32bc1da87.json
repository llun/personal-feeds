Apple discusses multiple different pin designs that would connect the charger to the device. The patent shows a pin that is more round in one image, while another shows a more flat-surface design.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe patent itself doesn't mention or reference an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by name, but an image in the filing depicts what seems to be the bottom of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger concept. Compared to the current Lightning port on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; has its advantages. Based on a set of magnets, &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; allows the device to easily detach from the charger if it gets tripped on or yanked. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-11.47.24-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1270\" height=\"1492\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786488\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup, Apple reintroduced &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; in the form of large circular magnets on the back of the device. Currently, Apple is marketing &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a place to charge and attach various accessories. \r\n<br/>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-accessories/\">All the MagSafe Accessories You Can Buy for iPhone 12</a></li></ul>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe patent could entail Apple's long-term vision of turning the current &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charge on the back of the device as a place for accessories, such as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-working-on-magsafe-battery-iphone-12/\">battery pack</a>, and leave the magnetic &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger on the bottom in place to charge the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Implementing the concept on a lighter weighted device like an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would presumably require a detaching mechanism using weaker magnets with more give.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week, reliable Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">poured cold water</a> on hopes that Apple would switch the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a USB-C connector <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/iphone-keeping-lightning-no-usb-c/\">anytime soon</a>. Kuo states that USB-C has lower specifications compared to Lightning and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;. Kuo specifically says that if an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the future abandons Lighting, it would immediately adopt a portless design with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is expected to bring &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; back to the Mac, according to both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/macbook-pro-better-displays-faster-magsafe-charging/\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">Kuo</a>. The version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; expected to debut in the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/#whats_next_for_the_macbook_pro\">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> will likely feature a similar design to previous iterations and offer faster-charging speeds.
