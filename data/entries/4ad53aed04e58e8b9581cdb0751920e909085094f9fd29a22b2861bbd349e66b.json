Following a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/fight-against-patent-trolls-flags-in-the-senate-but-states-push-ahead/\">widespread campaign of patent demand\nletters</a>,\nmore than 30 states <a href=\"https://www.patentprogress.org/patent-progress-legislation-guides/patent-progresss-guide-state-patent-legislation/\">passed some kind of\nlaw</a>\nplacing limits on bad-faith patent assertions. […]</p>\n\n<p>The Washington case reveals just how widespread Landmark’s threats\nare. From January 2019 to July 2020, Landmark sent identical\ndemand letters to 1,176 small businesses all across the country.\nThose letters threaten to sue unless Landmark gets paid a $65,000\nlicensing fee. Landmark essentially insists that if you use a\nwebsite for e-commerce, you infringe this patent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds like no one is going to be rooting for Landmark in this case other than their fellow patent trolls.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/25/patent-troll-washington-state\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4ad53aed04e58e8b9581cdb0751920e909085094f9fd29a22b2861bbd349e66b","category":"Tech"}
