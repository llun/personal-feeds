If Spotify chooses not to collect payments via the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌, Apple purportedly \"applies a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions\" on the company. It is also said that Apple was \"locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, and Apple Watch,\" thereby making &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; a more attractive option for subscribers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn what appears to be a significant advancement in the antitrust case, Apple looks to be hit with charges by the European Commission, suggesting that the company has likely been found to have conducted itself anti-competitively and violated the EU's antitrust rules. The EU is now actively preparing a charge sheet against Apple, according to sources speaking to <em>Reuters</em>, which may be sent to the company before the summer.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Spotify antitrust case is one of several opened by the European Commission into Apple's business practices last year in June last year, including similar cases from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/apple-new-eu-antitrust-complaint-kobo/\">Kobo-owner Rakuten</a>. It is not yet known what exactly the EU's charges could involve, but it has been suggested that Apple could be forced to pay a fine or make changes to its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business model in Europe to foster greater competition.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/eu-prepares-to-charge-apple-in-spotify-dispute/\">EU Prepares to Charge Apple in Antitrust Dispute With Spotify</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-prepares-to-charge-apple-in-antitrust-dispute-with-spotify.2287049/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=c7pcqzW5REM:uoWnKys8x9Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=c7pcqzW5REM:uoWnKys8x9Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/c7pcqzW5REM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d084c7f7144962741a1f390cd27a79d5d118bf104bec116f29f507920043b25e","category":"Apple"}
