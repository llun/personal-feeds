Upon inspection, Mark realized the bike frame had broken, leading him to conclude that flex as the suspension is beneficial to how a bicycle rides. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/3a-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thus, the Slingshot! </p>\n<p>There is, of course, a lot more to this design than what meets the eye. Though we can all agree, the concept did not catch on.

I asked owner <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bouslayer\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew</a> to share a couple of words on his unique snack machine:</p>\n<p>“What is there to say about this bike that can’t be gleaned from the photos? My good homie baby Dave rescued the frame from the scrap pile behind <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/backalleybikes/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Back Alley Bikes</a> here in Carrboro, NC. The rest was from parts bins and an abandoned recumbent trike.” </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“In a time where most bikes, regardless of genre, are marketed as ‘coming alive’ or inspiring confidence the harder you ride them, this bike does the opposite. When you throw a leg over the Slingshot it demands that you take it easy. It says, ‘friend, I’m warning you – please be cool, or I will destroy us both.'”</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7e69d8edf386c0417391e01f730eadbea49263676c4209213d20941791657ec1","category":"Cycling"}
