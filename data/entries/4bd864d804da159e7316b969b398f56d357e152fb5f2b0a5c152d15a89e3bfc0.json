They were prompted with 12 different\nApple-related subjects, and asked to rate them on a scale from 1\nto 5 and optionally provide text commentary per category. I\nreceived 55 replies, with the average results as shown below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The consensus scores, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/six+colors+report+card\">once again</a>, are very much in line with my own. I’ll post my personal report card later today, but Snell’s collected report card is a must read. So many good observations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/01/30/2020-six-colors-apple-report-card/\">Michael Tsai’s commentary</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple in 2020: The Six Colors Report Card’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/30/apple-six-colors-2020-report-card\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4bd864d804da159e7316b969b398f56d357e152fb5f2b0a5c152d15a89e3bfc0","category":"Tech"}
