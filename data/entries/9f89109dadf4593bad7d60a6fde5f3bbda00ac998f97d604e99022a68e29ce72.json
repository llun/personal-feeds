The new Watch is likely to be slightly thicker overall, but not in a way that’s noticeable to the user.</blockquote>The model will also include updated ultra-wideband functionality, the same underlying technology in the Apple AirTag item finder, according to Gurman, although added biometric sensors are likely to be pushed back to a successor model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple had previously aimed to put a body temperature sensor in this year’s model, but that is now more likely to be included in the 2022 update. The blood-sugar sensor, which would help diabetics monitor their glucose levels, is unlikely to be ready for commercial launch for several more years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>More to follow...</em><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">Bloomberg: Apple Watch Series 7 to Feature Thinner Display Borders and U1 Ultra Wideband</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CBQgfAJOUwY:6IaHkPgNcFg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CBQgfAJOUwY:6IaHkPgNcFg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CBQgfAJOUwY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f89109dadf4593bad7d60a6fde5f3bbda00ac998f97d604e99022a68e29ce72","category":"Apple"}
