I get on, I get a few questions, I answer as best I can, and I’m out. Two tidbits on my spot today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It seems like a widespread misconception that iCloud+ is new additional paid tier. It’s not: “iCloud+” is now just a name for any <em>paid</em> tier of iCloud, even the $1/month tier. If you pay anything at all for iCloud, you get iCloud+ features like the new Private Relay feature for Safari.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another question was about the relative dearth of AR announcements. I pointed to Maps, which is clearly moving in a very AR direction with turn-by-turn directions. But another big AR announcement from Apple this week is RealityKit 2, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apples-realitykit-2-allows-developers-to-create-3d-models-for-ar-using-iphone-photos/\">with 3D Object Capture</a> using nothing more than your iPhone or iPad camera. (Or a DSLR or drone camera.) This makes creating AR objects based on real-world objects several orders of magnitude easier, faster, and more accessible.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/08/cnbc-techcheck\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ea14e10e4f75ac0f909c03bc9849f8b0104431d0247f09f8a83746f59005ff91","category":"Tech"}
