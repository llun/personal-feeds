Rumors suggest the new iMacs will feature a design similar to the Pro Display XDR with slimmed down bezels and no metal chin.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRather than a curved rear design, the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models will feature a flat back, and at least one of the new models will measure in at 23 to 24 inches. Apple silicon chips will be included, and some dubious rumors have pointed toward <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/prosser-imac-colors-mac-pro-to-resemble-mac-minis/\">color options</a> that match the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> colors.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/\">discontinued the iMac Pro</a>, which was a high-end &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; option that was first released in 2017. With signs of the new iMacs in the current Big Sur beta and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac-pro/\">iMac Pro</a> discontinued and out of stock, we could see the refreshed &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models in the not too distant future.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/macos-big-sur-11-3-beta-5-unreleased-imacs/\">macOS Big Sur 11.3 Beta 5 Includes References to Two Unreleased iMacs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-big-sur-11-3-beta-5-includes-references-to-two-unreleased-imacs.2289392/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hKEHiuMn-jg:i8BSqJwL_o8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hKEHiuMn-jg:i8BSqJwL_o8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hKEHiuMn-jg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cde3c84f5836d972ef6dfa9b328aebfeb343dc201012dae936f11b116f055a64","category":"Apple"}
