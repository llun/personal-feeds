Here is my anti-wish list — things I <em>do\nnot</em> want to see. […]</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>More multitasking gestures in iPad OS. Make multitasking\nspatial, or make it stop. I hate user interfaces that are driven\nby guessing.</p></li>\n<li><p>More features in macOS that I’ll never use. It’s great as-is,\njust fix bugs and everyone will be happy.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/chock-anti-wish-list\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"741d5b6cc1bbbffce50fedc40791a3c2e96ae51738b8837891309504c8bddc15","category":"Tech"}
