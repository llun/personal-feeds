Martin was among those eventually dropped on the tough parcours, but a handful of the escapees held out into the finale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grossschartner powered off the front on the second trip over the Lago di Tenno and went up and over the final climb solo. He held on through the descent and the flat run-in to the line to take the stage win 34 seconds ahead of runner-up <strong>Nicolas Roche</strong>, with <strong>Alessandro De Marchi</strong> taking third on the day. Yates finished with a much reduced pack 40 seconds later to secure his GC win, with <strong>Pello Bilbao</strong> and <strong>Aleksandr Vlasov</strong> rounding out the overall podium.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Tour of the Alps (2.Pro)\n                                                    <span>Valle del Chiese/Idroland → Riva del Garda</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255730\">Full results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>1</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">GROßSCHARTNER Felix</a>\n                                        <span>BORA -

It shouldn’t be too long before I am back on the road. I’m being taken very good care of by my team and support network in the meantime.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freeman appeals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/21/richard-freeman-launching-appeal-struck-off-team-sky-british-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a>, Former <strong>British Cycling</strong> and <strong>Sky</strong> doctor <strong>Richard Freeman</strong> is appealing after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found his fitness to practice medicine impaired and removed his name from the medical register. Freeman was found guilty of having ordered testosterone to British Cycling headquarters in 2011 “knowing or believing” it was for a rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Guardian reports that the hearing would likely last two days, potentially in November or December.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Evenepoel putting off COVID-19 vaccine until after Giro to avoid potential side effects</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hln.be/giro/remco-evenepoel-laat-covidvaccin-pas-na-giro-zetten-het-is-te-kort-dag~a03d90b9/\" target=\"_blank\">Het Laatste Nieuws</a> reports that <strong>Remco Evenepoel</strong> has opted to not get vaccinated for COVID-19 ahead of the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> to avoid the possibility of side effects before the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel could have decided to receive a vaccination next week as one of the Belgian athletes set to compete in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, but he plans to get it after the Giro instead so as not to have to deal with potential side effects so soon before the Italian Grand Tour. <strong>Deceuninck-QuickStep</strong> team doctor <strong>Philip Jansen</strong> told Het Laatste Nieuws that Evenepoel already has the presence of antibodies, which suggests that he may have had an asymptomatic infection at some point in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Amy Jones has the <strong>latest from the world of women’s cycling</strong> in this week’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/womens-cycling-weekly-issue-22/\" target=\"_blank\">Women’s Cycling Weekly</a>.</li><li>Abby Mickey has the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/preview-your-guide-to-the-2021-womens-liege-bastogne-liege/\" target=\"_blank\">preview</a> with everything you need to know ahead of the women’s <strong>Liège-Bastogne-Liège</strong>.</li><li>Matt de Neef has the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/preview-your-guide-to-the-2021-mens-liege-bastogne-liege/\" target=\"_blank\">preview</a> with everything you need to know ahead of the men’s <strong>Liège-Bastogne-Liège</strong>.</li><li>The latest episode of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/nerd-alert-podcast-electronic-shifting-is-what-people-want-but-is-it-what-they-should-want/\" target=\"_blank\">Nerd Alert Podcast</a> takes a closer look at <strong>electronic shifting</strong>.</li><li><strong>Strava</strong> has added <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/strava-adds-mesmerising-3d-terrain-heatmaps/\" target=\"_blank\">3D terrain Heatmaps</a>.</li><li><strong>4iiii</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/4iiii-shimano-crank-buyback-program/\" target=\"_blank\">might buy</a> your old left crank.</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/simon-yates-wins-the-tour-of-the-alps-daily-news/\">Simon Yates wins the Tour of the Alps: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"d2db58dc59e5102947e0857600a0c87cb98b2cd6211761b8ac8d442ab65f9598","category":"Cycling"}
