The new feature is nicknamed WSLg, and it includes both X and PulseAudio servers. We gave WSLg some limited testing today, and it performed rather well.</p>\n<p>After running <code>apt install firefox</code> in the WSL2/Ubuntu terminal, we ran an Ubuntu-flavored web browser and played several videos on YouTube. We don't necessarily recommend you base your next HTPC on WSLg—but the videos were watchable, with decent frame rate and non-skipping audio. (We tested WSLg with a Ryzen 5 Pro 2500U-powered <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/mini-pc-review-the-ryzen-5-pro-2500u-powered-minisforum-um250/\">Minisforum UM250</a> Mini-PC.)</p>\n<p>More importantly, <code>virt-manager</code> worked very well on the little Minisforum—in very short order, we set up a \"virt-ception\" by using <code>virt-manager</code> beneath WSL2/Ubuntu running on Windows 10 to access a <em>Windows</em> VM running under <em>Ubuntu</em> on a machine across the office. (You can also see a Hackintosh VM in the background.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759568#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1759568&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dcd71ec63e14184e8537a89cd33e35bfa474382a741f37c33a5434ec880efce2","category":"Tech"}
