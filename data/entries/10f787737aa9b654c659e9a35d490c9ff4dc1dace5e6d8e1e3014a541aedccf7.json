It’s the right chip if you want\nmaximum battery life and the right CPU for optimal performance.\nWant the amazing performance of an M1 iMac, but can’t afford (or\nhave no need) for the expensive display? Buy a $699 Mac mini, with\nexactly the same CPU. Apple’s M1 positioning, evaluated in its\ntotality, claims the CPU is cheap and unremarkable enough to be\nsold at $699, powerful and capable enough to sell at $1699, and\npower-efficient enough to power both a tablet and a pair of\nlaptops priced in-between. […]</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s willingness to position the M1 across so many markets\nchallenges the narrative that such a vast array of x86 products is\nhelpful or necessary. It puts Intel and AMD in the position of\njustifying why, exactly, x86 customers are required to make so\nmany tradeoffs between high performance and low power consumption.\nSelling the M1 in both $699 and $1,699 machines challenges the\nidea that a computer’s price ought to principally reflect the CPU\ninside of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bingo.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/23/hruska-m1-x86\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"10f787737aa9b654c659e9a35d490c9ff4dc1dace5e6d8e1e3014a541aedccf7","category":"Tech"}
