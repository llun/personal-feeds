Bailey has been <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/11/baileys-rocky-mountain-hammer-basket-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">sending them on his basket bike</a> and late last year, I added them to my Sklar tourer as well. Today we featured <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/04/kyles-sklar-touring-fat-bike-in-29-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle’s Sklar touring bike</a>, which features the new “Bikepacker’s Delight”, a bar with 19-degree backsweep, a 5” wide stem clamp area (for bags and such), 38mm rise (1.5”), and come shipped at 875mm wide (34.4”), which can be cut to 780mm with a 185mm grip area.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-59.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Kyles-Sklar-Touring-Bike-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>While the black powdercoated Bikepacker’s Delight are sold out, DOOM still has nickel-plated bars in stock (pictured above). These bars are perfect for singlespeeds, trail bikes, tourers, klunkers, and the like. We’re stoked to continue to support New Mexico-based makers and are more than excited to continue to support DOOM in their endeavores. </p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.doombars.com/shop\" target=\"_blank\">DOOM Bars</a>‘ new website and browse their current bar options!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"16867c981ee2aef4f8ff1066b8dbef08564f864023f02ab356a3e98009ba4ca3","category":"Cycling"}
