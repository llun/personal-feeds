Soon, however, Microsoft is making it so that the feature can be used with just two people.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Love the fact I can use together mode in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftTeams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MicrosoftTeams</a> with only two people when I'm on the developer preview 😍<br /><br />I'm almost never in meetings with 5 or more people🙄 <br /><br />Great change 🌠 <a href=\"https://t.co/86bAitGBTW\">pic.twitter.com/86bAitGBTW</a></p>— 💫🌙 Amanda Sterner 💫🌙 (@amandassterner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandassterner/status/1410591387184242691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 1, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nSupport for smaller gatherings in Together Mode is currently limited to the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro\">developer Beta preview</a>, but will soon be available for all. If you want to try accessing the preview, click the ellipsis next to your profile picture, select About, then tick Developer Preview. If the option doesn't appear, it may be because of the way your work account is set up.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-teams/\">Microsoft Teams</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/microsoft-teams-together-mode-smaller-groups/\">Microsoft Teams' Together Mode to Gain Support for Smaller Groups</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-teams-together-mode-to-gain-support-for-smaller-groups.2303492/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=b32mEJyX1zE:KsNHFgD-k5w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=b32mEJyX1zE:KsNHFgD-k5w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/b32mEJyX1zE\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ccdd5882eb10bc75bb87330048844660ffabb1274d4601b57bb01585f14a9376","category":"Apple"}
