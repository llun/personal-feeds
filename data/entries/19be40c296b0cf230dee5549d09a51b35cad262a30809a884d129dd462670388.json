Its\npopularity waned with the arrival of the compact disc, an\ninvention Ottens also helped create as supervisor of a development\nteam, Philips said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cassette tapes were a huge part of my youth. That’s how I listened to music, and, because you could easily record on them, that’s how I collected my own music. You could listen to the radio on your boom box (I had a classic Panasonic that looked a <em>lot</em> like <a href=\"/misc/2021/03/panasonic.jpeg\">this one</a>) and when a song you liked came out, you could record it. When you caught a hit song with a tape ready to go, it was like winning a little jackpot. Cassette tapes were empowering and fun.</p>\n\n<p>In high school I bought a Sony Walkman that I recall cost a bit north of $100. It was a Sports model, one of the rugged yellow ones, and it offered what to me then sounded like amazing bass, and a digital FM tuner that was a game changer for getting a perfect signal. There’s a direct line from cassette tapes to iPods and the modern world of streaming.</p>\n\n<p>I spent a fortune on CDs when I went to college, but I don’t have the reverent nostalgia for CDs that I do for cassette tapes. (Cassettes were even part of computing — my elementary school had a few <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A\">TI-99/4A</a> computers with cassette tapes instead of floppy drives.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Lou Ottens, Inventor of the Cassette Tape, Dies at 94’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/12/lou-ottens-cassette-tape-inventor\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"19be40c296b0cf230dee5549d09a51b35cad262a30809a884d129dd462670388","category":"Tech"}
