That means it is ideal for use with items that are separated from you, such as luggage when traveling by plane.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile says that the SyncUP TRACKER can be \"found virtually anywhere\" and that it provides near real-time tracking and virtual boundary alerts even when it's located hundreds of miles away. Users can get notified when a SyncUP TRACKER moves out of range of a set boundary, there's an option to ring a lost item, and a built-in light sensor can detect light changes from light to dark so the device can tell if it's moved out of a backpack, locker, or other item.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/sync-up-tracker-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nEach SyncUP TRACKER can have a customizable profile with name and photo, plus there are options to customize how often it pings back to a smartphone in order to improve the TRACKER's battery life. SyncUP TRACKERs feature an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, and the built-in 900mAh battery lasts up to seven days before needing to be recharged.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's ‌AirTags‌ last for up to a year on a single CR2032 battery, but T-Mobile's need to be recharged more often because LTE drains more battery life.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile's SyncUP TRACKERs are priced at $60 each or $2.50 per month per device on a 24-month payment plan, and the data plan will cost $5 per month. At this price point and with a monthly fee, the SyncUP TRACKER has a specialized purpose and won't likely be direct AirTag competitor. Apple's ‌AirTags‌ are priced at $29 each and do not have a monthly fee.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/t-mobile-launches-syncup-item-tracker/\">T-Mobile Launches $60 LTE 'SyncUP' Item Tracker</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-launches-60-lte-syncup-item-tracker.2293731/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=paaiLJwFm1Q:CHOufzPTEkA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=paaiLJwFm1Q:CHOufzPTEkA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/paaiLJwFm1Q\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f163dbdad42dddbaa87624d548bb767a7ecc95ed27f16ab93807690ad6decc49","category":"Apple"}
