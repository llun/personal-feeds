And don’t worry about blocking those two USB-C ports—you’ll get them back (split into one multi-function USB-C port and one USB-C data port) along with a slew of others: two USB-A, HDMI, SD card, and microSD card slots. All in a hub that’s as thin as your MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re constantly scrambling for dongles to plug in various things due to a lack of ports on your new MacBook, this hub will be a life-changer. So go grab one before the price goes back up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Today’s deal:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://Anker%20USB%20C%20Hub%20for%20MacBook,%20PowerExpand%20Direct%207-in-2%20USB%20C&amp;xcust=1-1-343428-0-343429-15070&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Anker USB C Hub for MacBook, PowerExpand Direct 7-in-2 USB-C Hub for $36</a>]</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1fc949edb2179b03a57bcb0c633438ae55d87a5e703c93df04240b0d302edaba","category":"Apple"}
