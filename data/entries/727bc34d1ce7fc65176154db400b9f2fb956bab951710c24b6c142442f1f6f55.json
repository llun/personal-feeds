{"title":"Nomad's Latest Accessory Makes It Easier to Put an AirTag in Your Wallet","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/nomad-airtag-wallet-accessory/","date":1623697200000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14535369\">Nomad</a>, known for its range of accessories designed for Apple devices, today announced the Card for AirTag, which is designed to make it easier for an AirTag to fit inside a wallet for tracking purposes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/nomad-airtag-wallet-card-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith Card for AirTag, an AirTag fits inside the middle of a card-shaped holder that's then meant to fit inside of a wallet. According to Nomad, the design offers a smooth, uniform shape that allows the AirTag to be kept in the wallet without having a circular bump.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Card for AirTag is made from a polycarbonate material with a soft-touch TPU surface, and the AirTag is designed to snap into the middle.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/nomad-airtag-wallet-card.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's worth noting that the AirTag is quite thick on its own and not really designed for use within wallets, so this Card for AirTag is still going to take up a lot of space. Thin wallets may not accommodate the thickness of the AirTag and the accompanying Card accessory.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Card for AirTag is priced at $20, but there's a $5 discount when bundled with one of Nomad's wallets. Nomad is also today releasing new Bi-Fold and Card wallets priced starting at $69.95. The Card for AirTag and the new wallets can be purchased <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14535369\">from the Nomad website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Nomad.
