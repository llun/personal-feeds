Obviously, how you define the market will show whether or\nnot there’s a monopoly — and if you define the market as “the\nproducts that only this company makes” then of course that’s a\nmonopoly. But that’s not really relevant for a question of whether\nor not there is anti-competitive behavior. But here, these states\nhave come up with a market definition that is basically just\nAndroid. They’re not even doing the “mobile operating system”\nmarket. Instead, they claim that the relevant market is\nspecifically “the licensable mobile OS market” — meaning that\nApple iOS (which is not licensable from Apple) is excluded.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The licensable mobile OS market also excludes OSs that are\nunsuitable for mobile devices, such as OSs for simple cell\nphones, “flip phones,” or feature phones, or for other electronic\ndevices (such as laptop computers, desktop computers, and gaming\nconsoles, e.g., Nintendo DS, Xbox, PlayStation) that are not\nmobile devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I’m reading this right, they’re actually suggesting that if\nGoogle had decided <em>not</em> to license its OS, and <em>not</em> to let\ncompeting device manufacturers build their own competing phones,\nthen they would have <em>less</em> of an antitrust case against Google.\nAnd that seems … weird? And kind of nonsensical.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I’m missing something here, but it seems like Apple’s\ncontrol of iOS is a lot more strict, ditto for Nintendo, Microsoft\nwith Xbox, and Sony with the PlayStation. Google’s decision to\nlicense its OS and enable much wider competition, as well as\nallowing some sideloading and 3rd party app stores, seems a hell\nof a lot more competitive than all those other services — and yet\nthat’s all being used against Google, but not the others?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What these attorneys general seem to want is something that’s not possible: mobile platforms that have the security and privacy of iOS and Android but the openness of PC platforms like Windows and Mac.</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit complains about the warnings Android shows to users before they can sideload an app from outside the Play Store. I’ve done that — I actually installed the Epic app store for Android last year, when Epic first filed its lawsuits against Apple and Google. The warnings Android shows aren’t misguided <em>at all</em>. They’re fair and sensible — installing a third-party app store on your phone <em>is</em> dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Going after Google for its stewardship of the Play Store feels a bit like going after Apple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Apple_Inc.\">in the e-books case in 2013</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/12/masnick-google-play-antitrust\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0c3e07b5787955de3b81622e765911c5f6db9904fec6fdf27732c2c8f2425203","category":"Tech"}
