The shoes come double-boxed with printing on each boxes. In an era where a lot of our local shops are out of stock of various goods, we&#8217;ve had to order some things online and nothing came presented like this. Not even my ski boots. It&#8217;s just one of the ways that Rapha excels at design.</p>\n<p><em>They even come with a storage baggie and heel inserts. Best of all, no plastic. Everything is recyclable. </em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206756\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Out of the Box</strong></p>\n<p>Once you open the packaging, it&#8217;s hard to not first be overwhelmed by the Powerweave upper material. Rightfully so too! It&#8217;s quite busy, like static from a cathode ray tube television. This 3D printed material features TPU-reinforced yarns of the fabric, resulting in a weather-resistant upper that is reported to be durable and resistant to abrasions, all while keeping the weight down. While they don&#8217;t feel feather-lite, they ain&#8217;t exactly heavy.</p>\n<p>For reference, the size 46 I have weighed in at 850g for the pair with cleats. Yes, with the cleats, because that&#8217;s how you ride in them, right?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206752\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-9.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206753\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>While the upper looks like something out of a performance basketball shoe, the sole is what really caught my attention. With carbon shanks, a lot of &#8216;gravel&#8217; or &#8216;adventure&#8217; shoes can be too stiff to scramble around on rocks. These shoes feature a carbon footplate and a plush rubber sole and deliver a surprisingly comfortable ride quality.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206763\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Sizing, Fit, and First Impressions</strong></p>\n<p>Typically, I wear a 47 across the board but the 47 in these shoes were pretty big. I had to size down to a 46. Once the sizing was sorted, I headed out for a dirt road loop from my house where I like to spend my mornings if I have a few hours to kill. Even just walking around my house getting ready to ride, I was amazed at how comfortable the shoes were. After three hours on the bike in some considerably rough terrain, I felt like I was riding MTB trail shoes, in a gravel shoe package.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206765\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve gravitated to MTB shoes that are a bit narrower than normal for my gravel rides. This is because I&#8217;ve never been a fan of overly-stiff riding footwear, yet I understand why people love a good-n-stiff sole. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m always scrambling up rocky escarpments for photos, or rummaging around looking at rocks, or ya know, just being a weirdo. Long story short, I find MTB shoes infinitely more comfortable than &#8220;gravel&#8221; shoes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206766\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-206764\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/A-Look-at-Raphas-Powerweave-Explore-Gravel-Shoes-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>These shoes feel like a good in-between and I&#8217;d argue they&#8217;d make a good XC, bikepacking, or touring shoe as well. Time will tell how they hold up to rocky abuse and desert shenanigans but so far, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve owned a more comfortable gravel shoe. As for width, they aren&#8217;t super narrow, nor are they super wide. They&#8217;re mid-range in terms of both width and stiffness. The BOA closure can be polarizing, some love it, others hate it, but I got no beef with BOA.
