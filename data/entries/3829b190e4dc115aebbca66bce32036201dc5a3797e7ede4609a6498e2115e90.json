Xinuos is the company that purchased the remnants of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group\">SCO Group</a> in 2011. The SCO Group, in turn, is a company most famous not for its actual products but for its <a href=\"https://archive.arstechnica.com/news/posts/1053408587.html\">litigation</a> against IBM and Linux. That litigation began in 2003—partially funded by a very different Microsoft, only five years after the leak of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents\">Halloween documents</a> in which Microsoft acknowledged the \"long-term viability\" of open source software and discussed strategies to choke it out of the market.</p>\n<p>The substance of the original lawsuit is SCO's claim that IBM pulled proprietary code out of SCO Unix and inserted it into the Linux kernel. The subsequent 18 years have not been kind to SCO, which first filed for bankruptcy in 2007 and then eventually sold off its intellectual property (but not its litigation rights) to Xinuos, then named UnXis, in 2011.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753868#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753868&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3829b190e4dc115aebbca66bce32036201dc5a3797e7ede4609a6498e2115e90","category":"Tech"}
