{"title":"The Tim Berners-Lee NFT that sold for $5.4M might have an HTML error","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777609","date":1625159624000,"content":"<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Sir-Tim-Berners-Lee-blackboard-800x450.jpg\" /><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Sir-Tim-Berners-Lee-blackboard.jpg\">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Berners-Lee reflecting on the creation of the World Wide Web. (credit: Courtesy Sotheby's)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Two weeks ago, World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee sent an NFT of the web’s original source code <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/tim-berners-lee-makes-an-nft-from-world-wide-webs-objective-c/?comments=1&amp;unread=1\">to the auction block</a> with a starting bid of just $1,000. Yesterday, Sotheby’s announced that the crypto asset sold for $5.4 million. The sum makes Berners-Lee’s work one of the priciest NFTs of all time.</p>\n<p>The digital package included not just the source code but also a letter from Berners-Lee reflecting on the creation of the web, some original HTML documents, an SVG “poster” of thousands of lines of code, and a 30-minute visualization of the code being typed on a screen.<span> </span></p>\n<p>But there’s a twist. An eagle-eyed researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikko/status/1410191059481673730\">pointed out on Twitter</a> that the animation <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/this-changed-everything-source-code-for-www-x-tim-berners-lee-an-nft/source-code-for-the-www\">initially posted</a> on the Sotheby’s site had errors in the code, possibly introduced when the person making the video fed the Objective-C code through an app or web service to produce the typing effect in the animation. Instead of angle brackets that are present in the code (&lt; and &gt;), the HTML codes for the symbols (&amp;lt; and &amp;gt;) appeared instead. On the poster, which was made by a Python script created by Berners-Lee, the brackets appear correct. Presumably, they are also correct in the code itself.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777609#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777609&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"365f5bee1295c617c60be73aa3063818659554774b52aefa45582b83bdeb7910","category":"Tech"}
