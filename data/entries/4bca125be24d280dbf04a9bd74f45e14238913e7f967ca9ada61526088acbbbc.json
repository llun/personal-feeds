The company said it is now seeking emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. However, the vaccine may still be dogged by doubts.</p>\n<p>The Phase III trial conducted in the US, Peru, and Chile found that the vaccine was 79 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease, <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/astrazeneca-us-vaccine-trial-met-primary-endpoint.html\">the company reported</a> early Monday. Previous trial results suggest efficacy could be as low as <a href=\"https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2020/azd1222hlr.html\">62 percent</a>.</p>\n<p>In the new 32,449-person trial, two-thirds of participants were dosed with the vaccine while the remaining third were given a placebo. There were <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/22/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-shows-better-than-expected-efficacy-in-u-s-trial/\">five cases of severe disease</a> in the trial, all in the placebo group.
