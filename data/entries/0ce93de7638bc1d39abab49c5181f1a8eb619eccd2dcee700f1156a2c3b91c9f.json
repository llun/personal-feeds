The app requires users to be invited to the app to use it, making it somewhat exclusive for users who are lucky enough to have an account. The data from App Annie shows that as of February 1, the app had obtained 3.5 million downloads. A little more than two weeks later, that number more than doubled to 8.1 million.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://bvajresh.medium.com/charting-the-growth-of-clubhouse-audio-app-9672aaa82f80\">Estimates</a> beyond <em>App Annie</em> indicate that downloads for the app could be as high as 10 million. The significant uptick in downloads could be attributed to appearances on the app by Tesla founder Elon Musk, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Clubhouse, when contacted for comment on the statistics by <em>TechCrunch</em>, says that it doesn't disclose user numbers.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/clubhouse/\">Clubhouse</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/clubhouse-tops-8m-downloads-reports/\">Clubhouse Reportedly Surpasses 8 Million App Store Downloads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/clubhouse-reportedly-surpasses-8-million-app-store-downloads.2285353/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=at69xeIjrzw:CEQ3ffFIAkw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=at69xeIjrzw:CEQ3ffFIAkw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/at69xeIjrzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ce93de7638bc1d39abab49c5181f1a8eb619eccd2dcee700f1156a2c3b91c9f","category":"Apple"}
