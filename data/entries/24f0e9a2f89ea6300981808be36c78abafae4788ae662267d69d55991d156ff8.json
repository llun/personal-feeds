Since this is an M1 Mac, there is obviously not a separate GPU, and most of the key components are on the SoC. That means that upgrading the RAM or the GPU is not a possibility. iFixit compares the logic board to that found in the M1 MacBook Air.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767482#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24f0e9a2f89ea6300981808be36c78abafae4788ae662267d69d55991d156ff8","category":"Tech"}
