Instead, those using the free plan must choose a device type to use the service with.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/lastpass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1125\" height=\"633\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783907\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nStarting on March 16, 2021, those who do not pay for LastPass will need to decide if they want to use LastPass on mobile devices like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or on computers. Choosing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will disable access on laptops and desktop computers, and choosing computers will disable access on mobile devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTo use LastPass on all devices, a LastPass Premium account is required. LastPass Premium is priced starting at &#36;3 per month when billed annually. LastPass is <a href=\"http://www.lastpass.com/buy-premium?cp=LPP2021-DT-25CS\">offering a discount</a> at the current time that brings the price down to &#36;2.25 per month.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor free users, the first login on or after March 16 will set the active device type, and LastPass is providing three opportunities to switch preferred devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlong with the access change, as of May 17, 2021, email support will be limited to Premium and Families customers. LastPass free account holders will have access to the Support Center with self-help resources and access to the LastPass Community.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lastpass/\">LastPass</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/lastpass-free-account-limits/\">LastPass Limiting Free Accounts to Either Computer or Phone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lastpass-limiting-free-accounts-to-either-computer-or-phone.2284926/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XcEdxmFuhKk:LIJ0Nru9NdY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XcEdxmFuhKk:LIJ0Nru9NdY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XcEdxmFuhKk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"34a9c3fecc9fba6e68558d3a8d0f4703f1aa27d83878a9a781f7ba9697da9238","category":"Apple"}
