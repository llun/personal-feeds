Instead, it will charge the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> using standard 7.5W wireless Qi charging. The pack weighs 120 grams and has a built-in 5,000 mAH battery, meaning an &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; can be fully charged twice on the go.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/HyperJuice-Magnetic-Wireless-Battery-Pack_Front-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"3000\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-791174\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe battery pack itself charges over USB-C, which also means it doubles as a portable standard power bank for any smartphone, thanks to its USB-C port that supports up to 12W of charging power. The battery pack design is straightforward, featuring a four-stage LED charging indicator and an on-off button on the bottom. Hyper says the battery pack features \"industry-leading advanced temperature control, overcharge protection, and foreign object detection.\" \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/HyperJuice-Magnetic-Wireless-Battery-Pack_Apart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"3000\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-791175\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe HyperJuice Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack is available for <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperjuice-magnetic-wireless-battery-pack\">order now for &#36;39.99</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner Hyper Shop.
