We are proud to today unveil a brand new public tool, allowing riders across the country to view annual bike theft rates in their local area and identify hotspots where crimes are being reported.</p>\n<p>'The new tool will be regularly updated to provide an ongoing resource to members of the public. We hope this will be useful to the fast growing number of riders, and help increase awareness in high-risk areas.'</p>\n<p>While the map may help to find the best spot to park your bike – or good places for cyclists to live or ride – we'd still recommend getting <a href=\"/reviews/690/buyers-guide-choosing-the-best-bike-lock\">a good bike lock</a> and insurance.</p>\n<p>For more information on the tracker visit <a href=\"http://bike-theft-map.bikmo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bikmo.com</a></p>\n<p><em>Images: Bikmo</em> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/bikes\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d39b709f9fe125bd27e186a12b6c8f97a5ad189ae6134fa81cb41ce0056770b7","category":"Cycling"}
