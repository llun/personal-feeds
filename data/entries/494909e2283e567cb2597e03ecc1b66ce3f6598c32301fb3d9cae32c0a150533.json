It's made from a plastic material with some rubber accenting, and it's fairly small and lightweight given that it needs to attach to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> magnetically.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank is MagSafe-compatible, <strong>not MagSafe</strong>, so it is limited to 5W charging rather than 15W charging like a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charger. At 5W, it's going to charge at slower speeds, but since it is able to adhere to the back of an ‌iPhone‌ magnetically, it's more convenient than a standalone power bank because it stays in place.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMagnetic strength is decent, but it stays adhered best when used with a MagSafe-compatible ‌iPhone‌ case. Without a case, the magnet is decent, but the hold is better with a magnetic case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith a 5,000mAh capacity, the PowerCore Magnetic Power Bank can charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a> to full, but for other iPhones, you're only going to get a partial charge. Anker says it can charge the ‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro to 95 percent and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> to 75 percent, so it doesn't have as much capacity as other power banks on the market, but it's still a useful charge amount when you're in a pinch because of its portability and ease of use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe PowerCore Power Bank can be charged over USB-C, and you can check the charge level with the indicator lights that are next to the USB-C port on the device. You can use Anker's power bank with other Qi-enabled accessories, but the magnetic attachment feature is limited to the ‌iPhone 12‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe PowerCore Magnetic 5K Power Bank can be <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Portable-Anker-PowerCore/dp/B08TW7BRTJ\">purchased from Amazon</a> for $40, but Anker is having supply issues at the current time and it is out of stock.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anker/\">Anker</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/anker-magnetic-power-bank-hands-on/\">Hands-On With Anker's MagSafe-Compatible Battery Pack</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-ankers-magsafe-compatible-battery-pack.2291814/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oIfKf-Jl1ho:4yWyz9OjKnU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oIfKf-Jl1ho:4yWyz9OjKnU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oIfKf-Jl1ho\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"494909e2283e567cb2597e03ecc1b66ce3f6598c32301fb3d9cae32c0a150533","category":"Apple"}
