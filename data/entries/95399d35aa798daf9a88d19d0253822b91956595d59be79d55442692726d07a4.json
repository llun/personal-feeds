For 2021 it has a new frameset update and four new colorways. This bike was first released in 2019 as the ultimate all-road machine with its massive tire clearance, adjustable geometry, and now Otso has added to its versatility by adding three bottle bosses to each side of the fork for extra storage capacity so cyclists can use the same bike for gravel racing as they do for longer rides like tours and bikepacking. </p>\n<p>There are also four new colorways to share: Forest &amp; Coral, Black &amp; White, Burgundy &amp; Red, and Matte Desert &amp; Black (pictured).</p>\n<p>Beyond the new fork and colorways, everything we know and love about the Waheela C remains:</p>\n<p>-Adjustable geometry: Otso’s patented Tuning Chip rear dropout system allows the wheelbase to be lengthened or shortened by up to 20mm and the bottom bracket height to be raised or lowered by 4mm. This allows the Waheela C to transform from a confident, stable gravel bike (in the rear Tuning Chip position) to a nimble, agile option for CX races or local trails with tight corners.<br />\n-Giant tire clearance: this bike can fit 700c x 54mm, 650b x 54mm, 27.5” x 2.2” or 29” x 2.1” tires.<br />\n-EPS-molded carbon frame.<br />\n-Unrivaled ride quality: the rider is centered over the wheels for extra confidence and stability, while the longer top tube adds an aggressive, racy feel. Meanwhile, bowed seat stays make for a compliant rear triangle that’ll absorb bumps in the road and give you comfort while you’re spending all day on the saddle.</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://otsocycles.com/collections/waheela-c?goal=0_c11ccc04b2-26888255c2-316692442&amp;mc_cid=26888255c2&amp;mc_eid=932ba7151c\" target=\"_blank\">Otso</a>!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"95399d35aa798daf9a88d19d0253822b91956595d59be79d55442692726d07a4","category":"Cycling"}
