That was fortuitous timing, because on Tuesday a new trailer dropped for <em>F9</em>, the next installment, which arrives in theaters on June 25.</p>\n<p>We actually got our first look at <em>F9</em> well over a year ago, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/fast-furious-9-trailer-the-only-4-minutes-of-the-film-youll-need-to-watch/\">when the first trailer dropped at the end of January 2020</a>. Family has been a central theme to the <em>F&amp;F</em> movies, and that continues here. Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel) and the gang have to confront his younger brother Jakob (John Cena), described as \"the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they've encountered.\" He's working with criminal mastermind Cipher (Charlize Theron), who sports a much more flattering haircut than in <em>Fate of the Furious</em>, the movie where she <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/04/fate-of-the-furious-may-be-fun-but-it-made-my-brain-hurt/\">improbably hacked a bunch of old cars to drive themselves</a>.</p>\n<p>Also returning to the series is Han Lue (Sung Kang), who we all thought died at the end of <em>Tokyo Drift</em>. (This was revealed to be the work of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who was bad in <em>Furious 7</em> but then turned out to be good in <em>Fate of the Furious</em> and <em>Hobbs and Shaw.</em>)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756953#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756953&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
