Van Aert rode cyclocross races independently for several months, and then joined Jumbo-Visma in March of 2019. Nuyens sued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert’s defense claimed that he had “urgent reason” to terminate his contract because Nuyens had tried to get coach Niels Albert to sign a statement blaming Van Aert for Albert’s own departure from the team. Initially, the court ruled in Van Aert’s favor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the labor court in Antwerp overturned that ruling. Van Aert must now pay severance, albeit at a lower amount than Nuyens had been seeking. The former Tour of Flanders winner sought over €1 million from Van Aert. Van Aert won’t have to pay quite so much, but he still owes €662,000 plus court costs following Wednesday’s decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert can still appeal Wednesday’s decision, but only on procedural grounds and no longer on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/wout-van-aert-ordered-to-pay-e662000-to-nick-nuyens/\">Wout van Aert ordered to pay €662,000 to former team</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6b5096b08448df57fa1a46f2383bac504fb6e9b1a7daae6a6026da9714461c7a","category":"Cycling"}
