In a <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.344015/gov.uscourts.caed.344015.44.0.pdf\">court filing</a> today, the US Department of Justice said it \"hereby gives notice of its voluntary dismissal of this case.\" Shortly after, the court announced that the case is \"dismissed in its entirety\" and \"all pending motions in this action are denied as moot.\"</p>\n\n<p>The case began when Trump's DOJ <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/09/california-governor-signs-net-neutrality-rules-into-law/\">sued California in September 2018</a> in US District Court for the Eastern District of California, trying to block a state net neutrality law similar to the US net neutrality law <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/\">repealed by the Ajit Pai-led FCC</a>. Though Pai's FCC lost an attempt to impose a blanket, nationwide preemption of any state net neutrality law, the US government's lawsuit against the California law was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/trump-admin-and-isps-restart-lawsuit-against-california-net-neutrality-law/\">moving forward</a> in the final months of the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>The Biden DOJ's voluntary dismissal of the case puts an end to that. \"I am pleased that the Department of Justice has withdrawn this lawsuit,\" FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said today. \"When the FCC, over my objection, rolled back its net neutrality policies, states like California sought to fill the void with their own laws. By taking this step, Washington is listening to the American people, who overwhelmingly support an open Internet, and is charting a course to once again make net neutrality the law of the land.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740656#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740656&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"164307818815b30243e6ba7431fd4bcef24150be2c9d2c6c79ff012f543d9736","category":"Tech"}
