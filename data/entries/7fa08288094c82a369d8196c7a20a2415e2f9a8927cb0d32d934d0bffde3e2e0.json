It looks just like the old iPad Pro.

The big surprise is that the new iPad Pros have the M1 SoC, just like full-blown Mac computers.</p>\n<p>Apple says the eight-core CPU will deliver 50 percent faster performance compared to the previous iPad Pro, and the eight-core GPU delivers up to 40 percent faster graphics performance. Storage is faster, too, with a 2x performance improvement, and there's a new 2TB configuration.</p>\n<p>The USB-C port is being upgraded with Thunderbolt compatibility, allowing the iPad to power additional displays with up to 6K resolution and other accessories. There's also optional mmWave 5G onboard. The new front camera is a 12 MP wide-angle lens. A tracking feature called \"Center Stage\" will automatically crop a video-chat image to keep you in the frame as you move around.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758096#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758096&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7fa08288094c82a369d8196c7a20a2415e2f9a8927cb0d32d934d0bffde3e2e0","category":"Tech"}
