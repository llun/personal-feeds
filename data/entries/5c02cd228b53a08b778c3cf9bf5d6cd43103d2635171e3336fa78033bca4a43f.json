Now, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> is preparing to launch an app that uses image recognition <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/algorithms/\">algorithms</a> to provide more expert and personalized help. A brief demo at the company’s developer conference <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-2021-highlights\">last month</a> showed the service suggesting several possible skin conditions based on uploaded photos.</p>\n<p>Machines have <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/algorithm-doesnt-replace-doctors-makes-them-better\">matched</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/01/look-x-rays-moles-living-ai-coming-job/\">outperformed</a> expert dermatologists in studies in which algorithms and doctors scrutinize images from past patients. But there’s little evidence from clinical trials deploying such technology, and no AI image analysis tools are approved for dermatologists to use in the US, says Roxana Daneshjou, a Stanford dermatologist and researcher in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/machine-learning/\">machine learning</a> and health. “Many don’t pan out in the real world setting,” she says.</p>\n<p>Google’s new app isn’t clinically validated yet either, but the company’s AI prowess and recent buildup of its health care division make its AI dermatology app notable. Still, the skin service will start small—and far from its home turf and largest market in the US. The service is not likely to analyze American skin blemishes any time soon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776504#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776504&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5c02cd228b53a08b778c3cf9bf5d6cd43103d2635171e3336fa78033bca4a43f","category":"Tech"}
