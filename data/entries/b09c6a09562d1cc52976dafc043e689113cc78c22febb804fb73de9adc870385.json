But when youâ€™re a sprinter in the twilight of your career, you take what you can get, and a minor result takes on a greater symbolic significance.Â </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The life cycle of a top sprinter is a fickle thing. To be at the top of the game requires blistering speed, bravery, and tactical smarts, along with a committed lead-out train. When a rider discovers that magical formula, it can look effortless. When they donâ€™t, the gap between wins can seem interminable.Â </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last time AndrÃ© Greipel won a race was in late January 2019, half a world away on the west coast of Africa at the UCI 2.1-rated Tropicale Amissa Bongo. The German veteran had just been dropped by Lotto-Soudal, and just started what would be a one-year stint with Arkea Samsic.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3FI8pWCNj8/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3FI8pWCNj8/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Andre Greipel (@andregreipel)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Arkea Samsic management was clearly hopeful that Greipel would deliver great things, but Amissa Bongo was one of the few bright spots in one of his quietest-ever seasons. At that yearâ€™s Tour de France â€“ one of Greipelâ€™s happy hunting grounds â€“Â he only cracked the top 10 on a single occasion, finishing sixth on the Champs-Elysees.Â </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of that year, Greipel signed a three year contract with Israel Start-Up Nation, a cushy gig that would see him through to retirement. In a torrid 2020 season that was disrupted by COVID-19 calendar interruptions, Greipelâ€™s most prominent result was, again, sixth on a stage at the Tour de France. At the Tour Down Under, where Greipel has won a colossal 18 stages over his long career, he went winless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to 2021, the island of Mallorca and the 1.1-rated one-day Trofeo Alcudia-Port dâ€™Alcudia, part of the Challenge Mallorca. On a largely flat parcours in the Spanish sun, the race came down to a bunch sprint.Â </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two veterans, AndrÃ© Greipel and Alexander Kristoff â€“ a gorilla and a stallion â€“ went to the line together, moving left toward the barriers in lockstep. As the line approached, Greipel was holding Kristoff off by half a bike length.Â </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Volata ajustadÃ­sima en Port dâ€™AlcÃºdia para <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndreGreipel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AndreGreipel</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamIsraelSUN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TeamIsraelSUN</a> ) sobre <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kristoff87?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Kristoff87</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamEmiratesUAE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TeamEmiratesUAE</a> ) .<br /><br />ðŸ“¹ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soydiegoayus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@soydiegoayus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7ewo7GnEWi\">pic.twitter.com/7ewo7GnEWi</a></p>â€” ChallengeMallorca (@ChallengeMca) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChallengeMca/status/1393923632326483970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 16, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>A sprinterâ€™s professional cycling career is defined by milliseconds and millimetres, but when you stretch those tiny measurements out across a decade, they add up. As Greipel crossed the line first to take his 157th win, his trademark smile stretched across his face. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greipelâ€™s storied career has included 22 Grand Tour stage wins, alongside other results big and small. This one wasnâ€™t one of the big ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the moment, you get the sense that it was one that mattered.Â </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/andre-greipels-long-drought-is-over/\">AndrÃ© Greipelâ€™s long drought is over</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b09c6a09562d1cc52976dafc043e689113cc78c22febb804fb73de9adc870385","category":"Cycling"}
