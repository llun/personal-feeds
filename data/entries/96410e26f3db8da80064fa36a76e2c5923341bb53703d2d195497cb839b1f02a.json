Naturally, I obliged, and last night we hung out at our office here in Santa Fe and talked about bikes, photography, other randomness related to this website. I won&#8217;t give too much away but I was really stoked on how it went.

It&#8217;ll master gravel roads, doubletrack, and singletrack, all while keeping the feel nimble and light. They make for great tourers and bikepacking machines, with big front triangles, and compact gearing. The drop bars allow for many hand positions, which is crucial for battling headwinds and alleviating hand fatigue.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-208156\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Bikes-Or-Death-Chumba-Stella-Ti-Drop-Bar-29er-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>The Stella titanium was designed as a hardtail mountain bike. This particular frame was the personal bike of Vince, one of the co-owners of Chumba, who built it up as a hardtail for Texas singletrack and bikepacking. When Patrick bought the frame from Vince, he took the build in a different direction altogether. Utilizing Shimano GRX, Patrick went with a 1x drop bar drivetrain, a rigid Whisky fork, XC wheels, and a fast-rolling XC tire for gravel roads.
