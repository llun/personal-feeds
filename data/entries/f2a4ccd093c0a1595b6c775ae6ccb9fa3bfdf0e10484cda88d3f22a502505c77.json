Jonah has had them loaded up with bottles and cargo bags without issue. While there have been a number of similar products on the market, including the made in Durango <a href=\"http://www.kingcage.com/index.php?products=yes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">USB from KingCage</a>, these Topeak mounts have proven to be a robust option as well and they won&#8217;t scratch your lowers as metal bands can. They install on tubes with ø20 &#8211; ø60mm diameters and are sold in pairs. Your local dealer can order these, so ask them if you&#8217;re interested. </p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.topeak.com/us/en/products/245-Accessories/1093-VERSAMOUNT\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Topeak</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f2a4ccd093c0a1595b6c775ae6ccb9fa3bfdf0e10484cda88d3f22a502505c77","category":"Cycling"}
