It was the first car brand to crack 10 million vehicles in a year. Itâ€™s responsible for the extremely sensible Prius, which is the worldâ€™s best-selling hybrid. Itâ€™s the biggest company by revenue in Japan, and itâ€™s the tenth biggest company worldwide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toyota, dear reader, knows whatâ€™s up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One area where Toyota <em>may</em> not know whatâ€™s up, however, is â€˜bicyclesâ€™. The company has come to this realisation thanks to an Instagram post from the companyâ€™s US arm, first posted three days ago to the companyâ€™s 2.1 million followers, which has steadily taken on a life of its own in the days since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Letâ€™s break down what weâ€™re looking at here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Toyota 4Runner. Practical, utilitarian, grey, ready to squirt some dirt. RRP: US$36,340Â â€“ $50,470, depending on how many trinkets you get with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Foreground:</strong> Serious-looking mountain biker. Heâ€™s got the full-length downhill-bro gear on, some big black boots that I donâ€™t know enough about DH riding to judge the authenticity of, a full-face helmet and some goggles. He is ready to shred some gnar. The props department has nailed it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah. But wait. What is that betwixt our heroâ€™s legs? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has v-brakes. It has reflectors. It has Schrader valves. Most egregiously, it has a kickstand. Itâ€™s about $150 worth of finest department-store duallie, hastily assembled from a box while the photographer waited for the good light. The only thing that would have made it more realistic is if the fork was on backwards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if anyone â€“ anyone at all â€“ is riding a bike theyâ€™re doing it right. This guyâ€™s not riding a bike, though; not really. Heâ€™s a prop â€“ like his outfit, like his bikeÂ â€“ clumsily calibrated to sell the idea of a Toyota 4Runner to people that actually ride bikes. And those people did not respond favourably: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Toyota-comments-collage-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Select fan-mail for Toyota, ðŸ’–  from cyclists</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tough day for Toyota USAâ€™s social media team.
