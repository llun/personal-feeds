In spite of this, users with a wearable and a heart condition such as atrial fibrillation are more likely to undergo medical procedures.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpecifically, this group of wearable users was more likely to undergo an ablation, which is a medical procedure that seeks to restore a normal heartbeat.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not clear if the people in the study who wore wearables and had ablations had worse symptoms than the control group and so needed the treatment as a result, or if the wearables encouraged them to see a doctor and have the procedure sooner.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt may simply be the case that people with heart conditions who decide to wear an Apple Watch do so due to general concerns about monitoring their health. It is also possible that wearable users could see their device detecting an abnormal heartbeat more often and therefore they worry that their atrial fibrillation is getting worse, even when it is not.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch and similar health-monitoring wearables are the focus of a growing number of studies in the medical field, where they have been used to investigate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/study-into-whether-apple-watch-can-detect-covid-19/\">COVID-19</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/27/apple-watch-assess-frailty-study/\">frailty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/biogen-apple-watch-iphone-cognitive-health-study/\">cognitive health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-watch-heart-failure-study/\">heart failure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-watch-health-research-studies/\">asthma</a>, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-watch-users-heart-procedures-more-likely/\">Apple Watch Users More Likely to Have Medical Procedures on Their Heart, Study Finds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-users-more-likely-to-have-medical-procedures-on-their-heart-study-finds.2298936/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FZdctTgqYh8:RR1aQv3gbKU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FZdctTgqYh8:RR1aQv3gbKU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FZdctTgqYh8\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dab64df712c056d4728a66edd4117839dfc02205b26d9f52d8ede066499f201b","category":"Apple"}
