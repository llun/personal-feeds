It</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would, however, require rosters and budgets that surpass the limitations of most women’s teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that’s fine. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the double-edged sword of women’s cycling — much of what makes it so brilliant is also, unfortunately, a product of it being chronically under-funded and undervalued.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/products/issue-101-womens-special\"><em><strong>Buy Rouleur's women's issue here</strong></em></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a dearth of racing opportunities and reduced rosters for the women are clearly not to be celebrated, an overlapping calendar is equally undesirable. Because here’s the thing: I don’t want to have to experience the FOMO inherent in trying to follow two stage races at once with women’s racing, too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discussions within women’s cycling around how to grow the sport often warn against traversing the same path as the men’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usually with good reason </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and in this particular case, the men can keep their clashing calendar. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reduced number of women’s races elevates the ones that actually go ahead. Even without a Coronavirus-ravaged early season, fewer women’s races means that the very best of the women’s peloton show up to lower level races such as the 1.2 GP Oetingen last Sunday, where Marianne Vos took third.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forgetting even the fan perspective, the fact that the sport’s financial model relies on sponsor exposure through televised footage is something that women’s teams know all too well. The fight to see more live images of women’s races has been going on for years. Why then, as either a sponsor or a fan, would you ever want to have the TV coverage of one race cannibalising the other?</span></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Alex_Whitehead2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1616067158\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: none;\"></div>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photo credit: Alex Whitehead/SWPix.com</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world of women’s cycling is small and the protagonists are easy to follow and relate to. Keeping up with women’s cycling </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while it might require trawling through Twitter in the absence of live coverage </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does not usually require keeping track of multiple races at once.</span></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-WBssxm\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fans are better able to get to know the characters in the women’s peloton and maintain the broader narrative of the season so far without taking up permanent residence in front of their TV or computer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In one regard, I hope that women’s cycling grows to the point that I am scrambling to fire up an aged iPad to watch one women’s stage race, while the other plays out on a TV in front of me. On the other hand, I would prefer to be able to take in every moment of the exhilarating action at each women’s race as it happens without missing what’s happening elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following women’s racing doesn’t feel like a part-time job, and that’s no bad thing. Yes, more races are necessary to grow the sport, just don’t put them on at the same time. </span></p>\n<div class=\"klaviyo-form-UFKPji\"></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"8d05ad722160981a577e2330a95a40ad65eb20f341bd00fed793b777bbd1c7a7","category":"Cycling"}
