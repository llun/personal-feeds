Cars are expensive, so customers tend to be cautious when making such a large purchase. This explains why you see so many variations of silver exteriors and black interiorsâ€”it's safer for resale value that way. That's why I'm so enamored with these concept interiors that Lexus has commissioned for its latest concept, the LZ-F Electrified.</p>\n<p>The car company offered up the interior of the LZ-F Electrified as a canvas for footwear designer Salahe Bembury, artist Ondrej Zunka, and the leather crafters at Hender Scheme, each of whom came up with something radically different.</p>\n<p>Bembury's take contrasts the advanced technology of an EV with plenty of natural materials. The seats are made of cork, with a rough suede on the seatbacks. The center console is made from cedar, and the steering wheel appears to be cut from granite.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760818#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760818&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
