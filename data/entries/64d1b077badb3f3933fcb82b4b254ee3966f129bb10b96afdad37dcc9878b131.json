The bad music you used to listen to; your Myspace profiles from way back in the day; your LiveJournals of fan fiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/pogacar-and-zigart-the-power-couple-of-slovenian-cycling/\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> – cycling revelation and winner of the <a href=\"http://www.cyclingtips.com/tag/tour-de-france\">2020 Tour de France</a> – is young enough to dodge many of those indignities … but he did have a <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/tadejpogacar5/pins/\">Pinterest account</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a massive tip-of-the-hat to VeloNews’ Sadhbh O’Shea, whose research methodology I am a big fan of, this secret of cyberspace is now out in the open: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Doing some research and I have come across what looks like Tadej Pogacar’s short-lived Pinterest account featuring tattoos and funky shoe designs. I think this might interest you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robynjournalist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@robynjournalist</a><a href=\"https://t.co/IRqKLoSkUc\">https://t.co/IRqKLoSkUc</a></p>— Sadhbh O’Shea (@SadhbhOS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SadhbhOS/status/1406990083983564814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>You forget how young Pogačar is, such has been his dominance over the last couple of years. Back in 2018, he didn’t even have a WorldTour contract. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then just 19, he was riding for the popular Slovenian Continental team that we’ve definitely all heard of, Ljubljana Gusto Xaurum. And Pogačar, well, he was just a nice young kid from Komenda with dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What were those dreams? I’m glad you ask. Tattoos, mostly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s fleeting dalliance with Pinterest shows that the future star really, really just wanted a tattoo of a lion on his arm. He wasn’t sure which type of lion; he was eyeing off big ones and small ones. Male ones and female ones. Majestic Aslan-esque lions, dualling ones, roaring ones, and little ones with truncated manes so they fit into geometric shapes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seems to have been a fleeting interest in deer, bears, and wolves, too, although he would successfully dodge the bullet of joining the Deceuninck-QuickStep ‘wolfpack’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s mostly lions, though. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-22-at-3.56.45-pm-1340x597.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s just one cycling photo of Tadej Pogačar on his 2018 Pinterest board. It’s of <a href=\"https://prijavim.se/gallery/photo/18/3658/1/\">a rainy day in February, at that year’s GP Laguna Porec</a>, and Pogačar’s crossing the line for fifth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not a race that most of the cycling world has heard of, but at the time it was clearly a result that meant enough to young Tadej Pogačar that he saved it to his digital mood board. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this means much, given the world-beating trajectory of his recent career, but it – along with those teenaged dreams of an animalistic sleeve – gives a fascinating glimpse into the person behind the cycling superstar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadej Pogačar circa 2021 does not – to the best of our knowledge – have his lion tattoo. He does, however, have a few results on his palmares that would’ve seemed unfathomable to him back then, when he was just a gangly kid from Slovenia with a Pinterest page and a dream. </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/teenaged-tadej-pogacar-dreamed-of-lion-tattoos/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"64d1b077badb3f3933fcb82b4b254ee3966f129bb10b96afdad37dcc9878b131","category":"Cycling"}
