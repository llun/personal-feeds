Apple is hosting limited sessions in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a> this year, a departure from last year when Apple Camp transitioned to an in-home experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/apple-camp.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple Camp is open to children aged 8 to 12, but sessions are highly limited and generally only available in major cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, Apple is offering one session on the Clips app on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, which the company says will allow children to \"make movie magic\" with short videos. Signups are available on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/today/collection/applecamp/\">the Apple Camp section</a> of the Today at Apple website.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nChildren who are not in an area where an Apple Camp session is being held can access a new at-home activity guide that's available to download. It offers a full calendar of activities like making a photo album of textures, creating a storybook starring toys, making a tourist map, making songs in GarageBand, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-camp/\">Apple Camp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-basics-help-and-buying-advice.78\">Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-camp-sessions-kids-2021/\">Apple Launches Limited In-Person Apple Camp Sessions for Kids</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-limited-in-person-apple-camp-sessions-for-kids.2302938/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NTpcMe49vWw:hEN4eiJtcnk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NTpcMe49vWw:hEN4eiJtcnk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NTpcMe49vWw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e3cf317096485cad88cf2fdd45f16dd061c2a6ecb4d1c7d8b68afd06e6d6cba1","category":"Apple"}
