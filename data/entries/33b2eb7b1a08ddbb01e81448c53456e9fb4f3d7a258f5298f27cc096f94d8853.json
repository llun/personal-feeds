This scheme helped AT&amp;T \"beat\" analysts' revenue forecasts in the first quarter of 2016, the SEC said.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.555523/gov.uscourts.nysd.555523.1.0_1.pdf\">complaint</a>, filed Friday in US District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that AT&amp;T repeatedly violated the Securities Exchange Act and the SEC's Regulation FD (for \"<a href=\"https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/fair-disclosure-regulation-fd\">fair disclosure</a>\") in March and April of 2016. The regulation \"prohibit[s] selective disclosures by issuers of material nonpublic information to securities analysts,\" the SEC lawsuit said. AT&amp;T executives \"disclosed AT&amp;T's internal smartphone sales data and the impact of that data on internal revenue metrics, despite the fact that internal documents specifically informed Investor Relations personnel that AT&amp;T's revenue and sales of smartphones were types of information generally considered 'material' to AT&amp;T investors, and therefore prohibited from selective disclosure under Regulation FD,\" the SEC said in a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-43\">press release</a> about its complaint.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T claimed in a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/att-disputes-sec-allegations-301241737.html\">response</a> Friday that \"there was no disclosure of material nonpublic information and no violation\" and said it will fight the lawsuit. AT&amp;T also said that the SEC \"spen[t] four years investigating this matter,\" but no charges were brought during the Trump administration. The lawsuit was filed about six weeks after President Biden appointed Democrat Allison Lee as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/biden-presidential-inauguration-2021/card/u7LKXfuWtyNqLCXvBP6D\">acting chair</a> for the SEC; although the SEC is an independent agency, its commissioners and chair are appointed by the president.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747866#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747866&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"33b2eb7b1a08ddbb01e81448c53456e9fb4f3d7a258f5298f27cc096f94d8853","category":"Tech"}
