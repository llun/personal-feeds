The company is sure to announce details about the next versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, but we could also be in for a lot more, including (potentially) new Apple Silicon Macs.</p>\n<p>Here at Ars Technica, we'll be liveblogging the event as soon as it starts and publishing stories about the announcements as they are revealed.</p>\n<p>It's going to be an interesting event. We know a lot less about iOS 15 than we did about iOS 14 before last year's event, so there are sure to be some surprises.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770163#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770163&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce4d88bc0ad534c0b76363adcb6c790ffddb25b13b108ac8b89ad8262385cc6e","category":"Tech"}
