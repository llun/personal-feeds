(Did I miss that particular subgenre of Clancy books? No matter.) The game will launch on PC and most consoles on September 16.</p>\n<p>A meaty gameplay preview video showed a three-player squad moving through one of the game's combat levels, which will combine bespoke architecture with random alien placementsâ€”and Ubisoft's reps hinted to the aliens being able to create walls, gates, and restrictions to randomly redefine your descent into each level's belly. The resulting gameplay resembles<em> Left 4 Dead</em>, with a mix of weak and superpowered aliens (dubbed \"Archies\") potentially splitting squads up as they battle and survive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772743#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772743&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9302f62d5924cc80501686b12881f68573123c9e4e8ddf1c9726cd2d3f8b4906","category":"Tech"}
