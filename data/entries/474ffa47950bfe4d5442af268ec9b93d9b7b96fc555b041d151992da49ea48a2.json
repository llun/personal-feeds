A later report <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/iphone-12-mini-low-january-sales/\">claimed</a> that the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;‌ accounted for only 5% of all ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ sales in the U.S. in the first half of January.\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/phone-13-mini-rumors/\">Will There Still Be an iPhone 13 Mini?</a></li></ul>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe JP Morgan analyst puts the slowing demand for the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; series as a whole down to weaker consumer spending in China and a normalization of demand trends following the initial excitement surrounding Apple's adoption of 5G connectivity in the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; series.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nChatterjee revised his shipment estimate to 52 million units for the March quarter, a 3 million decrease compared to his original expectations. For the June quarter, the analyst revised the number to 42 million units from 36 million units.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"However, at this time we do not see any reason to change our 2H21 volume forecast,\" said Chatterjee, noting that the supply chain is sticking with its 80 to 90 million build estimate for the first half of this year.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/j-p-morgan/\">J.P.
