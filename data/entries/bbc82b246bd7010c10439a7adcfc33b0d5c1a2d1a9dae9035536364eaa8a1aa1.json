Leakers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1413421547948150791\">DuanRui</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1413431603716497409?s=20\">Ice Universe</a> were both quick to re-post the images to Twitter, and the pictures show all four of the ‌iPhone 13‌ models that we are expecting, with dimensions similar to the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> lineup. The four devices come in the same 5.4-inch, 6.1-inch, and 6.7-inch options, with both standard and \"Pro\" variants of the 6.1-inch model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn terms of appearance, the main difference this year will be a slightly smaller notch on the front, a diagonal rear dual-camera array on the ‌iPhone 13‌ mini and the standard 6.1-inch, and a larger rear camera unit on the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro models. Schematics seen by MacRumors have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/iphone-13-models-larger-camera-bumps/\">revealed</a> that the upcoming iPhones will feature a thicker overall design and a larger camera bump on the ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ Pro and Pro Max. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/benks-iphone-13-case-models-2.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe larger camera modules are likely due to the rumored inclusion of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/27/sensor-shift-stabilization-all-iphone-13-models/\">sensor-shift stabilization</a> for all models of the lineup and improved <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/iphone-13-pro-sensor-shift-ultra-wide/\">Ultra Wide capabilities</a> on the ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro Max.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCase makers often base their initial case designs for upcoming iPhones based on leaks and rumors, so the images may not be true representations. However, all the information we've garnered so far would suggest there's good reason to believe they are accurate.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the lowdown on everything we know about the new features and improvements coming with the ‌iPhone 13‌, which Apple is expected to launch in its usual September timeframe, be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">dedicated guide</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/iphone-13-models-shared-on-weibo/\">Chinese Case Maker Shares iPhone 13 Chassis Models on Weibo</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chinese-case-maker-shares-iphone-13-chassis-models-on-weibo.2303713/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FJxX0rAT4zU:9QtSeYiBlpw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FJxX0rAT4zU:9QtSeYiBlpw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FJxX0rAT4zU\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bbc82b246bd7010c10439a7adcfc33b0d5c1a2d1a9dae9035536364eaa8a1aa1","category":"Apple"}
