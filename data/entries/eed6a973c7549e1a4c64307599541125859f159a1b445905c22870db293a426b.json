These devices, which range from the size of a small toaster to a large bread box or even bigger, help control equipment and processes on assembly lines and in other manufacturing environments. Engineers program the PLCs using Rockwell software called Studio 5000 Logix Designer.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the US Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Administration warned of a critical vulnerability that could allow hackers to remotely connect to Logix controllers and from there alter their configuration or application code. The vulnerability requires a low skill level to be exploited, CISA <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-21-056-03\">said</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745776#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745776&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eed6a973c7549e1a4c64307599541125859f159a1b445905c22870db293a426b","category":"Tech"}
