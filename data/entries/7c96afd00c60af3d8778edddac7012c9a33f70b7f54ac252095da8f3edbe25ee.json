In other news, the versatile Kata Blanka Vas will be joining SD Worx.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for the latest from the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dane Cash<br />News Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cavendish wins stage 3 of the Tour of Turkey</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Cavendish</strong> nabbed his second straight <strong>Tour of Turkey</strong> stage win on Tuesday, powering to victory on stage 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 212.6 km stage from Beysehir to Alanya came down to another bunch kick. Israel Start-Up Nation led out the sprint for <strong>André Greipel</strong>, who launched with around 200 meters to go. Cavendish quickly wound up to speed and surged into the lead, however, and no one could pull even over the closing meters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish took his second stage win in two days ahead of <strong>Jasper Philipsen</strong>, with <strong>Stanislaw Aniolkowski</strong> taking third on the day. With his stage victory, Cavendish extended his overall lead to eight seconds over Philipsen.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3>SD Worx signs Kata Blanka Vas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SD Worx announced on Tuesday that <strong>Kata Blanka Vas </strong>will join the team on June 1. The 19-year-old Hungarian will compete in cyclocross, mountain bike, and road events for her new team on a deal that runs through 2022 after making the move from Doltctini-Van Eyck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vas finished on the podium of the past two under-23 cyclocross world championships and was second at the under-23 mountain bike world championships last year, in addition to being the national road champion of Hungary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With Kata Blanka Vas we can profile ourselves in cyclocross in the winter months,” SD Worx team manager Danny Stam said. “In addition, she has already achieved good results on the road, given her age. That makes her a good fit for the team. Finally, she is also seen as one of the greatest talents in mountain bike. This way she can qualify for the Olympic Games in Tokyo this year. This discipline is important to our material sponsor Specialized. As a result, we are open to her continuing to develop in these three areas.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Van der Breggen will miss Brabantse Pijl, uncertain for Amstel Gold Race</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of <strong>SD Worx</strong>, <strong>Anna van der Breggen</strong> will not race <strong>Brabantse Pijl</strong> due to illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wielerflits.nl/nieuws/zieke-anna-van-der-breggen-onzeker-voor-amstel-gold-race/\" target=\"_blank\">Wielerflits</a>, van der Breggen is tested negative for COVID-19, but her status for this weekend’s Amstel Gold Race is not yet clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No Tour of the Alps for Bernal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Egan Bernal</strong> will not race the <strong>Tour of the Alps</strong> as he had previously planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/egan-bernal-to-skip-tour-of-the-alps-go-directly-to-giro-ditalia/\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclingnews</a>, Bernal is opting to keep training at altitude in Colombia instead of making the start in the five-day stage race as he builds towards the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meme of the Day</h2>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnJhtzFPdM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> \n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div> View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnJhtzFPdM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnJhtzFPdM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnJhtzFPdM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnJhtzFPdM/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by The KOMeme (@cat3memes)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hannah Nicklin ponders why <strong>online racing</strong> is <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/the-dramatic-irony-of-zwift-why-racing-online-is-so-compelling/\" target=\"_blank\">so compelling</a>.</li><li>Sarah Gigante <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/the-chaos-of-my-first-tour-of-flanders/\" target=\"_blank\">takes us through her first start</a> at the <strong>Tour of Flanders</strong>.</li><li>Ronan Mc Laughlin <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/how-gel-wrappers-are-being-turned-into-playgrounds-and-helping-fund-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">explains</a> how <strong>gel wrappers</strong> are being turned into playgrounds and helping fund schools.</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/cavendish-sprints-to-another-win-in-turkey-daily-news/\">Mark Cavendish sprints to another win in Turkey: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7c96afd00c60af3d8778edddac7012c9a33f70b7f54ac252095da8f3edbe25ee","category":"Cycling"}
