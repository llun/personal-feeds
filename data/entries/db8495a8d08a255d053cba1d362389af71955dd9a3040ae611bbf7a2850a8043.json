The Brydge Air MAX+ features a row of shortcut keys for controlling screen brightness, accessing media controls and emoji, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a detachable Magnetic SnapFit Case that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> fits into to keep it safe from scratches and other damage, with the case offering 4-foot drop protection. Brydge added an antimicrobial agent to the case to protect against bacteria and viruses.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike Apple's own Magic Keyboards, the Brydge Air MAX+ connects to an ‌iPad‌ over Bluetooth, so it does need to be charged now and then. Brydge offers an \"Instant-On\" feature that's designed to allow the ‌iPad‌ to connect to the Max+ seamlessly when active.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBrydge also recently introduced the Brydge 12.9 Max+, which is compatible with the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models and offers all of the same features as the Brydge Air MAX+. We <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/04/brydge-keyboard-hands-on/\">reviewed that model</a> earlier this month and were impressed with its design and functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Brydge Air MAX+ can be <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-air-max-plus\">preordered from the Brydge website</a> for $149.99, and it will ship out in June.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/brydge/\">Brydge</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/11/brydge-air-max-keyboard/\">Brydge Debuts New Air MAX+ Keyboard With Trackpad for iPad Air and iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/brydge-debuts-new-air-max-keyboard-with-trackpad-for-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro.2295762/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PaIiVnh0Ows:uzZ8eatTbiM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PaIiVnh0Ows:uzZ8eatTbiM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PaIiVnh0Ows\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db8495a8d08a255d053cba1d362389af71955dd9a3040ae611bbf7a2850a8043","category":"Apple"}
