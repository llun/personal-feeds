They then allegedly used their control to take over what Twitter has said were 130 accounts. A small sampling of the account holders included then-Vice President Joe Biden, Tesla founder Elon Musk, pop star Kanye West, and philanthropist and Microsoft founder and former CEO and Chairman Bill Gates.</p>\n<h2>Doing time</h2>\n<p>The defendants, prosecutors have alleged, then caused the high-profile accounts—many with millions of followers—to promote scams that promised to double the returns if people deposited bitcoins into attacker-controlled wallets. The scheme generated more than $117,000. The hackers also took over accounts with short usernames, which are highly coveted in a criminal hacking forum circle calling itself OGusers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750206#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750206&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"20faca4d9c1a93d8984b967d30b729f8ebe12e415fd2097f48f96f99a7d4155f","category":"Tech"}
