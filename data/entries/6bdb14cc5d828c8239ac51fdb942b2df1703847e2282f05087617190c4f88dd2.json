Software that was attacked included the\nSafari browser on iPhones but also many Google products, including\nthe Chrome browser on Android phones and Windows computers. […]</p>\n\n<p>Instead of focusing on who was behind and targeted by a specific\noperation, Google decided to take broader action for everyone.\nThe justification was that even if a Western government was the\none exploiting those vulnerabilities today, it will eventually\nbe used by others, and so the right choice is always to fix the\nflaw today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t think this was an easy decision, but I think it was the right call. Project Zero’s purpose is to find vulnerabilities and report them to get them fixed, period.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/09/google-project-zero\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6bdb14cc5d828c8239ac51fdb942b2df1703847e2282f05087617190c4f88dd2","category":"Tech"}
