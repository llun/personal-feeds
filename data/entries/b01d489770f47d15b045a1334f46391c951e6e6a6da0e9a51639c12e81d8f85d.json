U Deluxe</em></a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3umwHKU\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eisene\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition</em></a>. While we've seen a couple of these games go for slightly less around Black Friday, Nintendo still tends to be stingy about discounting its own Switch titles, so each deal is about $5-10 lower than the usual going rates we see online over the majority of the year.</p>\n<p>More importantly, the games themselves are worth the money: <em>Odyssey</em> is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/super-mario-odyssey-review-marios-densest-deepest-adventure-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">virtually a must-have</a> for any Switch owner or <em>Mario</em> fan, <em>Fire Emblem</em> pairs an engaging tactical-RPG with a surprisingly nuanced (anime) political thriller, and <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> are touched-up versions of a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/new-super-mario-bros-u-review-the-best-2d-mario-in-decades/\" target=\"_blank\">well-liked 2D platformer</a> and a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/how-rpg-fans-convinced-nintendo-to-release-two-japanese-titles-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\">beloved action-RPG</a>, respectively. If you're a Switch owner looking for something new to play, you could certainly do worse.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, our deals roundup has lower-than-usual prices on a number of Amazon devices ahead of Mother's Day—including our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/guidemaster-ars-tests-and-picks-the-best-e-readers-for-every-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">longtime favorite e-reader</a>, the Kindle Paperwhite—as well as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/best-mothers-day-gifts-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">recommended true wireless earbuds</a> from Jabra, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/garmin-forerunner-245-music-review-a-more-accessible-runners-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">GPS running watches</a> from Garmin, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\">noise-canceling headphones</a> from Sony, and much more.
