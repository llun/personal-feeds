Qualcomm will begin selling custom silicon Nuvia-based laptop chips in 2022, which are expected to boast impressive power consumption for extended battery life.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of using core designs licensed from Arm, Qualcomm is looking to use a completely custom core design for its chips, like Apple, to rival Apple silicon. Should Arm develop a better CPU than Qualcomm, Amon said that the company will seek to license the better architecture directly from Arm to ensure that its chips are industry-leading.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is currently a major customer of Qualcomm, with the Qualcomm modem chips being used in all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models. It has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/18/apple-working-on-high-end-mmwave-modem/\">widely reported</a> that Apple is in the process of developing its own <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/apple-designed-5g-modem-2023-iphones-rumor/\">custom in-house modem</a> to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-developing-modem-in-house/\">displace Qualcomm</a>'s component, with the first Apple modems appearing in new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/kuo-apple-designed-5g-modem/\">as soon as 2023</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Apple-5G-Modem-Feature-Triad.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAmon addressed the threat posed by Apple developing its own in-house modems, meaning that Qualcomm would lose Apple as a customer. Most immediately, Amon explained that Qualcomm has decades of experience designing modem chips, which would make it difficult for any rival to replicate its technology.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHe added that \"the Huawei addressable market is as big as the Apple opportunity is for us,\" suggesting that Qualcomm may be able to mitigate the loss of Apple as a client by taking up the void left in the Android market, which has been created by the banning of Huawei in the United States. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/02/qualcomm-ceo-plans-to-compete-with-apple-silicon/\">Qualcomm CEO Outlines Plans to Compete With Apple Silicon, Handle Apple's Shift to In-House Modems</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/qualcomm-ceo-outlines-plans-to-compete-with-apple-silicon-handle-apples-shift-to-in-house-modems.2303039/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bMbLZbMpn1g:7AKpuC_bas8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bMbLZbMpn1g:7AKpuC_bas8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bMbLZbMpn1g\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c5756413d761d10c09c28325f409005edce291060ceb1e6aa8200d37582b833a","category":"Apple"}
