The company claimed that because the performance of its qubits was so superior to those of its competitors, its computer could do better on a key quantum computing benchmark than quantum computers with far more qubits.</p>\n<p>Now, roughly a year later, the company finally released a paper describing the feat in detail. But in the mean time, the competitive landscape has shifted considerably.</p>\n<h2>It’s a trap!</h2>\n<p>In contrast to companies like IBM and Google, Honeywell has decided against using superconducting circuitry and in favor of using a technology called \"trapped ions.\" In general, these use a single ion as a qubit and manipulate its state using lasers. There are different ways to create ion trap computers, however, and Honeywell's version is distinct from another on the market, made by a competitor called IonQ (which we'll come back to).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755088#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755088&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9063fc906347281ee969e56701941ce8431f3c1239d4d9da2e327e12752f2c5c","category":"Tech"}
