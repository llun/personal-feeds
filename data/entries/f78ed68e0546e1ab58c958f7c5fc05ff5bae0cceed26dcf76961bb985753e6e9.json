An IP67 rating means that ‌AirTags‌ are water-resistant with a maximum depth of 1 meter up to 30 minutes. Despite this rating, Apple says the resistance may “decrease as a result of normal wear.”\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for battery life, Apple says that ‌AirTags‌, thanks to their use of low-energy, and encrypted Bluetooth, feature more than a year of battery life. Once the battery does run out, it can easily be replaced since they use a CR2032 coin cell battery.
