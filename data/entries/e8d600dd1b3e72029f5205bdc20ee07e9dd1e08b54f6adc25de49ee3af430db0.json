Apple discontinued the ‌iPod touch‌ 5 in 2015.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe haven't heard of any rumors suggesting Apple has an upgraded ‌iPod touch‌ in the works. The current seventh-generation ‌iPod touch‌ was the result of a refresh in May 2019, and is currently the only product in Apple's iPod product line, following the discontinuation of the iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2017. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mr-white/\">Mr. White</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPod_Touch\">iPod Touch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipod-touch-and-ipod.113\">iPod touch and iPod</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/unreleased-ipod-touch-5-chamfered-edges/\">Unreleased iPod Touch 5 With Chamfered Edges and 30-Pin Dock Connector Shared Online</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unreleased-ipod-touch-5-with-chamfered-edges-and-30-pin-dock-connector-shared-online.2300222/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EnzIoGKDtcs:U9OrfBmbfH0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EnzIoGKDtcs:U9OrfBmbfH0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/EnzIoGKDtcs\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e8d600dd1b3e72029f5205bdc20ee07e9dd1e08b54f6adc25de49ee3af430db0","category":"Apple"}
