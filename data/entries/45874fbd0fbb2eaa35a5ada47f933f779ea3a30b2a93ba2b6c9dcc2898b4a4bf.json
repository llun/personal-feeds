Apple's official account was accessed, as were the accounts of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, former U.S. President Barack Obama, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and President Joe Biden.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nClark this week will plead guilty to state charges in exchange for three years in prison and three years probation. Because Clark was just 17 at the time of the attack, he will be sentenced as a \"youthful offender\" and could be eligible to serve some of his time in a military-style boot camp.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nUnder the terms of the plea deal, Clark is not allowed to use computers without permission and supervision from law enforcement.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTwitter did an internal investigation after the breach and found that hackers targeted employees in a \"phone spear phishing attack,\" tricking them into thinking they were speaking to other Twitter employees to gain access to Twitter's internal tools.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMason \"Chaewon\" Sheppard from the UK and Nima \"Rolex\" Fazeli have also been charged in the attack and are facing prison time.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/florida-teenager-prison-apple-twitter-bitcoin-hack/\">Florida Teenager to Spend 3 Years in Prison for Twitter Hack That Affected Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/florida-teenager-to-spend-3-years-in-prison-for-twitter-hack-that-affected-apple.2288544/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GGPtWjOyfKA:mXzQRBRIUfA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GGPtWjOyfKA:mXzQRBRIUfA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GGPtWjOyfKA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"45874fbd0fbb2eaa35a5ada47f933f779ea3a30b2a93ba2b6c9dcc2898b4a4bf","category":"Apple"}
