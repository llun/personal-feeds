{"title":"More Leaked iPhone 13 Samples Show Smaller Notch, Repositioned Earpiece and Front Camera","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-sample-smaller-notch/","date":1618387599000,"content":"Leaker known as \"DuanRui\" has today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1382229686046978052\">shared an image</a> of two iPhone 13 \"film samples,\" which show the same rumored smaller notch design coming to the iPhone 13 series that we've seen from other sources.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/duanrui-iphone13-notch-samples.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn past tweets, DuanRui has accurately leaked the correct <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/25/iphone-12-mini-appears-leaked-case-stickers/\">names</a> of the iPhone 12 models and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/27/leak-ipad-air-touch-id-power-button-usb-c/\">iPad Air 4 manual</a> revealing its new design, so there's good reason to think this leak is credible, plus it matches up with previous rumors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the image, which appears to show screens for an iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 mini, the notch is visibly smaller, which is believed to be a result of the earpiece speaker being moved up into the top bezel, a design choice that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/20/leaked-iphone-12-schematics-smaller-notch/\">first rumored for iPhone 12 models</a> last year but failed to materialize.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe alleged ‌iPhone 13‌ samples also show the front-facing camera moved to the left side of the notch, in contrast to its current location to the right side of the notch in previous iPhones with the TrueDepth camera. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a report from Japanese site <em>Mac Otakara</em>, the ‌iPhone 13‌'s TrueDepth camera array is \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/iphone-13-thinner-notch/\">getting narrower</a>\" because the receiver at the top of the display will move to the edge of the case, as depicted in the images. <em>DigiTimes</em> also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/iphone-13-smaller-notch-pro-cameras-larger-cis/\">claimed in February</a> that the ‌iPhone 13‌ will feature a redesigned Face ID system that will allow for a smaller notch at the top of the screen.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nReliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also said that the ‌iPhone 13‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">will have a smaller notch</a>, although he did not mention the earpiece being repositioned.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe notch's design has gone unchanged since it debuted on the iPhone X in 2017. After the subtle tweaks to the notch in this year's upcoming iPhone series, Kuo believes Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">abandon the notch for a \"punch-hole\" design</a> for some of its 2022 iPhones, before it transitions to a real full-screen display in 2023 with the aid of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2023-iphones-under-display-face-id/\">under-display Face ID system</a>, which would remove the need for notches and holes entirely.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ rumors have suggested that the device will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/28/120hz-promotion-display-iphone-13/\">120Hz \"ProMotion\" displays</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/12/kuo-expects-iphone-13-mass-production-on-time/\">faster A15 chip</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/iphone-13-rumor-recap/\">larger batteries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">and more</a>. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duanrui/\">DuanRui</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-sample-smaller-notch/\">More Leaked iPhone 13 Samples Show Smaller Notch, Repositioned Earpiece and Front Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-leaked-iphone-13-samples-show-smaller-notch-repositioned-earpiece-and-front-camera.2291633/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IULtRbovmoQ:tBeEx1AX7Ns:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IULtRbovmoQ:tBeEx1AX7Ns:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/IULtRbovmoQ\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"16ca7dee13f9c0c0cbf763e7972ea07ded3e4f1be9e158c0ff2f6ca7d330bebb","category":"Apple"}
