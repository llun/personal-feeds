(credit: Rockstar Games)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, we reported that a <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> player sick of the game’s notoriously long load times took matters into his own hands, broke out the disassembler, and crafted his own fix. The long load times were due to the inefficient way that the <em>GTA Online</em> developers chose to parse and then sort the data in a large multi-megabyte JSON file.</p>\n<p>The fix—created by a coder known as <a href=\"%E2%80%9Chttps://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/%E2%80%9C\">t0st</a>—resulted in a 70-ish percent decrease in loading times, going by t0st’s own informal benchmarks. For players suffering from the JSON parsing issue, this means that they only have to wait perhaps one or two minutes to enter a <em>GTA Online</em> game, rather than the six-plus minutes they were previously stuck watching the loading screen.</p>\n<p>In the two weeks since t0st’s fix was made public, <em>GTA Online</em> developer Rockstar got in contact with t0st and acknowledged that t0st had indeed fixed a legitimate issue with the game and that he’d be receiving a $10,000 payment under Rockstar’s bug bounty program.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749918#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749918&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Lee Hutchinson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dd6d95eed0482ee6e65047d0d4a8318bcd84941a5a681bd0e28d99c8cdfa71f1","category":"Tech"}
