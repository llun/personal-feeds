These bikes were so ahead of their time and since their inception, we’ve seen lots of bikes that have the same look and feel. So when Dakota sent his in, we had to share it! Check out Dakota’s words and photos below…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/image2-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This is a 2016 AWOL Expert with 1×12 Sram GX/Apex drivetrain (thanks to the Ratio Technology upgrade kit) with a 10-50 GX cassette.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/image1-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/image0-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Rival Crank with 44t absolute black oval.

I had the opportunity to buy a frameset this year and was stoked! I moved the parts over from my current bike, added wider bars wider tires, and have been loving this on gravel and hope to load it up! I have a set of 27.5 wheels for the rough stuff with Teravail Ehlines 2.3”. I love the versatility of this bike!</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
