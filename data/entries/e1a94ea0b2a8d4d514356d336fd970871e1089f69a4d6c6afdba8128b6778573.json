I have always\npreferred to talk to him more than almost any other Amazon\nexecutive, because he does not shirk from a debate or retreat to\nstale talking points. He also was not going to give an inch when\nit came to tougher topics like potential bias in facial\nrecognition.</p>\n\n<p>On that hot-button issue, Mr. Jassy said clearly that it was not\nup to Amazon to be the moral arbiter of the world, but that he\nwould like government to step in. “People are looking for those\nextra sets of protections around the federal government explaining\nhow they want the (facial-recognition) technology to be used and\n[to have] real ramifications if you misuse it,” <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/andy-jassy-no-on-aws-spinoff-yes-on-facial-recognition-regs\">he said</a>. “And I\nwish they would hurry up, because if they don’t … you’re going to\nhave 50 different laws in 50 different states.”</p>\n\n<p>When I asked him about having to spin off AWS in the wake of a\npotential antitrust investigation — a prospect that would scare\nmany — he shrugged. “If we were forced to do it, I guess we would\nhave to do it,” he said. “We don’t spend a lot of time talking\nabout it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Kara Swisher on Andy Jassy’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/03/swisher-jassy\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e1a94ea0b2a8d4d514356d336fd970871e1089f69a4d6c6afdba8128b6778573","category":"Tech"}
