Hemmerstoffer previously nailed the design of the Pixel 4a all the way back in January 2020, so it's smart to take his Pixel 5a info seriously.</p>\n<p>There really isn't much to see in the renders since the Pixel 5a looks identical to previous Pixel devices like the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5, and it isn't that much different from the Pixel 4a. In this case, Google isn't fixing what isn't broken. The design looks perfectly modern with slim bezels and a hole-punch camera, and there's really no need to demand change for change's sake.</p>\n<p>Like a few other midrange phones, the Pixel 5a offers some design decisions you might actually prefer to a flagship smartphone. There's a flat-screen without any curved sides, a headphone jack, and a rear capacitive fingerprint reader. Hemmerstoffer says the phone has a plastic back, stereo speakers, and a 6.2-inch display, which is a size increase over the 5.8-inch Pixel 4a.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744523#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744523&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"be7ecb5e3f6964828eb97d91905620aba7d52519101ce2e53db84eac38adc8a9","category":"Tech"}
