Gazelle stopped taking trade-ins at that time, but has since reversed course on the decision.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs of April 5, Gazelle is once again accepting online trade-ins for smartphones and tablets. In an email to customers that was also shared with <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370595/gazelle-trade-in-program-is-back-returns-iphone-samsung-smartphone-selling\">The Verge</a></em>, Gazelle said that trade-ins were reinstated after feedback from consumers.<blockquote>Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, 'We're back, baby!' Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.</blockquote>When initially announcing that its online trade-in program was ending, Gazelle said that it would instead focus on its in-store ecoATM kiosks, which are designed to offer instant cash for devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGazelle operates more than 4,000 ecoATM units across the United States and has collected more than 25 million devices.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/gazelle-resumes-trade-in-program/\">Gazelle Decides Not to End Device Trade-In Program After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gazelle-decides-not-to-end-device-trade-in-program-after-all.2290843/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dQjEKwdxJxc:cmKqw2EeMk0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dQjEKwdxJxc:cmKqw2EeMk0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dQjEKwdxJxc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"56c8c633e52bbb4e483145fd36bdf4772c3f7295b72bf1b5db687b9b81c001c5","category":"Apple"}
