This data point was combined with reported symptoms associated with the disease, such as fever, aches, dry cough, and loss of taste and smell.\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>The Warrior Watch Study was not only able to predict infections up to a week before tests provided confirmed diagnoses, but also revealed that participants' HRV patterns normalized fairly quickly after their diagnosis, returning to normal roughly one to two weeks following their positive tests.</blockquote>The researchers hope that the results can help anticipate outcomes and remotely isolate individuals from others who are at risk, without having to perform a physical exam or administer a swab test, preventing potential spread before someone is highly contagious.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to <em>TechCrunch</em>, the study will in future expand in order to look at what other wearables can reveal about the impact of COVID-19 on the health of health care workers, including how things like sleep and physical activity may relate to the disease.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn related research that is ongoing, Apple is currently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-watch-health-research-studies/\">partnering</a> with investigators at the Seattle Flu Study and faculty at the University of Washington's School of Medicine to explore how changes in blood oxygen and heart rate can be early signals of the onset of influenza and COVID-19.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPrevious independent Apple Watch studies have shown that the smartwatch's heart sensors may be able to detect early signs of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/07/apple-watch-heart-rate-sensor-diabetes-detection/\">diabetes</a> and provide early warning signs of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/apple-heart-study-stanford-results/\">atrial fibrillation</a>. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/study-apple-watch-predicts-covid-before-swab-test/\">New Study Suggests Apple Watch Heart Rate Sensor Can Predict COVID-19 Up to a Week Before a Swab Test</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-study-suggests-apple-watch-heart-rate-sensor-can-predict-covid-19-up-to-a-week-before-a-swab-test.2284090/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NsK68jOdzQY:noC2PfMk3Gc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NsK68jOdzQY:noC2PfMk3Gc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NsK68jOdzQY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fbbfef6dc13fcc352cd433fc8e3baa0e15e87a7573ad439290ac5b7a975c868f","category":"Apple"}
