The company is accused of poisoning its customers, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/complaints-mount-after-5-kids-suffer-liver-failure-linked-to-alkaline-water/\">causing acute liver failure</a> and other serious health problems in adults, children, and pets.</p>\n<p>On March 16, the FDA and the <a href=\"https://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/news-release/acute-non-viral-hepatitis-illness-linked-to-real-water-brand-alkaline-water/\">Southern Nevada Health District announced</a> that they were investigating cases of acute non-viral hepatitis (resulting in acute liver failure) in five infants and children, all of whom consumed the company’s alkaline water. The water was the only common link between the five children and infants. Since then, customers have filed several lawsuits making similar claims, including three Californian women who filed <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Real-Water-lawsuit.pdf\">a federal lawsuit</a> in Nevada March 22 seeking class-action status.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Non-viralHepatitis-RealWaterAlkalineWaterBox03192021-980x554.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Box of Real Water bottles.

Real Water has also failed to notify its distributors of the March 24 recall of all its water products, which are still being offered for sale by online retailers, the FDA noted. In addition, the FDA reported that the company is still promoting its products on social media, despite the recall and serious health claims.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753755#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753755&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a52704aa52471b5cc5c61ceca561092920533df52cf21c184398b8698555b44","category":"Tech"}
