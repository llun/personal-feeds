{"title":"My bike: Toms Skujins and his 2021 Team Trek Emonda","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/my-bike-toms-skujins-and-his-2021-team-trek-emonda/","date":1614020640000,"content":"<p>In the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/chad-hagas-team-dsm-scott-addict-rc/\">first episode of My Bike</a>, Giro d&#8217;Italia stage victor Chad Haga of Team DSM was our first culprit, sorry, guest, and for this the second installment, we have an equally successful professional. A professional WorldTour rider that we like to claim as our own here at CT (for specific reasons). I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t mind that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toms Skujins of Team Trek-Segefredo is a man, nay a gentleman, with a King of the Mountains jersey, probably proudly hanging on his wall at home after spending an exhilarating few days in the polka dots back at the 2018 Tour de France. A man who is well known for his potato escapades. Yes, that gentleman is the one the only, Toms Skwinch, Sjinch, Skujins. That&#8217;s the one. Yeah, he&#8217;s also got a tricky last name.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1-1340x804.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-482816\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1-1340x804.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1-650x390.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1-190x114.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1-1080x648.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-EMONDA-1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Toms, along with many of the Trek riders this year, will be seen using the Emonda for most of the season. With its updated frameset, it&#8217;s now far more aero than the previous model yet still as light.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we dive in and take a good look at Toms&#8217;s new race bike for this season. Or more precisely, his training bike, but let us be honest here, there is practically no difference. There are a few tweaks, of course, but you&#8217;ll have to watch the video as he&#8217;ll let you know what they are. Don&#8217;t expect any Froome style grumbling from Toms about his new bike or set up, but do expect a sly nod to things that we the fans should keep an eye out for once the team hit the cobbled classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2021 it&#8217;s no surprise Toms is aboard the latest Trek Emonda. As we found out last season, when the bike was launched, a fair chunk of the team switched from their full-out-aero bike, the Madone, to the now aero/lightweight well-rounded race bike, the Emonda. It seems to hit the sweet spot from what we gather.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So without me spoiling anymore, I&#8217;ll hand you over to Toms, and he can let you know about his new bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282-1340x804.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"482822\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=482822\" class=\"wp-image-482822\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282-1340x804.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282-650x390.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282-190x114.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282-1080x648.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_282.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">Toms picked out the cages as a little something that he really is picky about.</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1-1340x804.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"482820\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=482820\" class=\"wp-image-482820\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1-1340x804.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1-650x390.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1-190x114.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1-1080x648.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MEN-MADONE-1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">The team also have the Trek Modone at their disposal, though from the sound of things, the new Emonda takes the limelight in the team trucks.</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"804\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308-1340x804.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"482819\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308.jpg\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=482819\" class=\"wp-image-482819\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308-1340x804.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308-650x390.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308-190x114.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308-1080x648.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trek-Segafredo_2021_308.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">The race wheels are Bontrager Aeolus XXX4 shod with Pirelli rubber.
