If you ask about another item that might perhaps have ‌Find My‌ integration with an AirTag, such as keys or a wallet, ‌Siri‌ says \"You don't have any items set up in the ‌Find My‌ app.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you ask about a device with no ‌Find My‌ integration like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, ‌Siri‌ says \"That type of device can't be set up in the ‌Find My‌ app, so I'm not able to find it for you.\" The new remote response is limited to iOS 14.5, and ‌Siri‌ does not understand the same request on devices running earlier versions of iOS, but there is one notable caveat here -- a <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sonikku_a2/status/1387851631455203331\">has pointed out</a> that ‌Siri‌ will also sometimes give a similar response when asked to \"‌Find My‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a>,\" but other Apple devices don't seem to give the same answer. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-clue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to the launch of the revamped ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/new-apple-tv-remote-with-find-my/\">there were rumors</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em> suggesting the remote designed for the device would indeed have ‌Find My‌ integration to allow it to be found should it be lost in the house. When introducing the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K and the new remote, though, Apple did not make any mention of ‌Find My‌ integration, nor is it anywhere on Apple's site or press materials related to the new devices. The remote also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/siri-remote-no-u1-chip/\">does not have a U1 chip</a> like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> for close-proximity location purposes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's possible that some kind of ‌Find My‌ integration is coming in the future, or that it's a feature that was considered for the ‌Siri‌ Remote and later scrapped, but it's not clear either way. We should find out more when the ‌Siri‌ Remote is available, or if Apple removes the ‌Siri‌ response from iOS.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri-remote/\">Siri Remote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/find-my-apple-tv-remote-siri-response/\">Siri Response Suggests Find My Support Might Come to New Siri Remote</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-response-suggests-find-my-support-might-come-to-new-siri-remote.2293947/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DyxsRcLNmNE:Yj7rM6N-f2U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DyxsRcLNmNE:Yj7rM6N-f2U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DyxsRcLNmNE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eaaf9ef15fae71a0c904cdc357bfeccb38db5e6cac6e21f05eb2f514208be101","category":"Apple"}
