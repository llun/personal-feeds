In a supplier-focused research note shared with MacRumors, the analysts said chipmakers Qorvo and Broadcom should be among the companies that benefit from the shift to Apple's in-house solution.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Apple-5G-Modem-Feature-16x9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788396\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/11/apple-2022-deadline-for-custom-5g-modems-iphones/\"><em>Fast Company</em>'s Mark Sullivan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-developing-modem-in-house/\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> are among several sources who have reported that Apple is working on its own modem for future iPhones. Apple reportedly began development of the modem in 2020, after <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">acquiring the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business</a> a year earlier to bolster its efforts. Barclays previously said the modem will support both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands of 5G, as to be expected.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple currently uses Qualcomm modems, including the Snapdragon X55 modem in iPhone 12 models. In 2019, a legal settlement between Apple and Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/apple-qualcomm-5g-modem-roadmap/\">revealed</a> that Apple will likely use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/iphone-13-snapdragon-x60-5g-modem/\">Snapdragon X60 modem in 2021 iPhones</a>, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/qualcomm-snapdragon-x65/\">Snapdragon X65 modem in 2022 iPhones</a>. The roadmap did mention the possibility of 2023 iPhones using an unannounced Snapdragon X70 modem, but this now appears less likely.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's modem would likely be manufactured by its longtime chipmaking partner TSMC.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/\">Barclays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/\">5G</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/apple-designed-5g-modem-2023-iphones-rumor/\">Apple-Designed 5G Modem Said to Debut in All 2023 iPhone Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-designed-5g-modem-said-to-debut-in-all-2023-iphone-models.2287965/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LZ3fdS_eQYk:eJ12j400U-4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LZ3fdS_eQYk:eJ12j400U-4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LZ3fdS_eQYk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cc391791b0613025f9b38eaa4ce19e88a1fd8bce9c4e22db239f624787b41559","category":"Apple"}
