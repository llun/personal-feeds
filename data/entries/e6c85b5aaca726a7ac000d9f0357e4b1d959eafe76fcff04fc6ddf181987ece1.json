Ride mountain bikes? Well, you have Tom Ritchey to thank for that, kind of. He is, after all, the Godfather of Gravel.</p>\n<p>In the latest edition of the Cyclist Magazine Podcast, James and Joe are joined by Tom from his California home (virtually) to bathe in his many anecdotes about the early days of off-road riding around California with Jobst Brandt and pioneering the first off-road bikes.</p>\n<p>This is Part 1 of our chat with Tom. Part 2 will be along shortly.</p>\n<p>If you liked this episode, please remember to leave us a review, comment and make sure to share with your cycling friends!</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you listen on Apple Podcast, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/cyclist-magazine-podcast/id1510572442\" target=\"_blank\">please click here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>In association with HJC Helmets and Jaybird.</p>\n<p>Cyclist Magazine Podcast sponsor Jaybird Sport is offering listeners 15% off its VISTA wireless headphones with the code 'cyclist15'.
