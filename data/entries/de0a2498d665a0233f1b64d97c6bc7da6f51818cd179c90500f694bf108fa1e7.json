Think of it as the bigger, more serious sibling to the S7 and the Wayward. It&#8217;s less swoopy, more serious, lighter, and faster-pedaling, yet it has clearance for a 29&#215;2.6&#8243; tire. </p>\n<p>This bike is Why&#8217;s first &#8220;pro-model&#8221;, akin to skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding. Jefe Branham is an ultra-endurance legend based in Gunnison, CO, and has been a friend and team rider for Why for two seasons. His feedback as to what his dream bike would be for going fast in the backcountry informed every decision in the El Jefe design. Jefe’s personal mantra is “Fast or Slow Just Go,” so with his input, Why turned it into a sandblasted graphic on the raw titanium. The lily flower in the graphics is a nod to his two-year-old daughter, Lillian.</p>\n<p>With a 73.3º seat angle, a 67.5º head angle, and a 120mm fork, the El Jefe is a nimble, fast, and capable hardtail with pricing beginning at $2,349 for a frame only at <a href=\"https://www.whycycles.com/our-bikes/el-jefe/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Why Cycles</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"de0a2498d665a0233f1b64d97c6bc7da6f51818cd179c90500f694bf108fa1e7","category":"Cycling"}
