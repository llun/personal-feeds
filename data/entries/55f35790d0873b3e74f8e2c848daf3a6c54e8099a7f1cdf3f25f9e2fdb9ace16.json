On the Mac side, some of the new features require an\nM1 processor.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, maintaining support for old devices while restricting\ncertain new features to more capable recent models is a great\nstrategy. That way, fewer people are forced to buy new hardware\njust to participate, but the new features encourage hardware\nupgrades for those who want to take advantage of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a testimony to Apple’s commitment to device longevity that iOS 15 will run on A9-based iPhones (2015’s iPhone 6S and 2016’s original iPhone SE). Of course they don’t get all the new features.
