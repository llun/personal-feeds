Bicycle shortages and delays are a matter of fact that don’t care if your daddy owns a bike shop. With the shop’s allocation of kids bikes from our manufacturers barely able to cover a quarter of the demand, I knew I was going to have to get creative. Combine that with the fact that my now 6-year-old twins are still pretty small for their age. They just can’t fit the majority of 20” wheeled bikes that are on the market. At the same time, their small stature and current single speed bikes didn’t stop them from regularly riding 4 or 5 miles a day, often while having to dismount and push up the bigger hills.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Check out this full project at <a href=\"https://www.alphabicycle.com/start-em-young/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha Bicycle&#8217;s blog</a>!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"807d75fa20da545153625dfc648ce968f380ca531c6ea833370ddca4c5d7e33a","category":"Cycling"}
