Code within the beta software reads, \"To improve charging efficiency and maximize available battery life, the battery pack will keep your phone charged at around 90%.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has been researching the ability for devices to charge each other for some time. Patents <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-researching-wireless-charging-ecosystem/\">discovered</a> in January reveal a concept of a future MacBook wirelessly charging an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch on either side of the trackpad. The patent envisions an ecosystem in which devices are reliant on each other for charging, and presumably syncing.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite the feature not being officially released, the technology itself is already available within the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;. According to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/14/hidden-iphone-12-feature-could-still-be-unlocked/\">FCC filings</a>, all models in the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; lineup have the ability to reverse charge an Apple accessory on the back. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would serve as a wireless charging pad for devices with wireless charging compatibility such as the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; (second generation), <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and the Apple Watch Series 3 and later.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn theory, Apple could enable the feature with an iOS update, although there's no indication the company will. It could be holding off on enabling the feature until it releases the newly reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-working-on-magsafe-battery-iphone-12/\">MagSafe battery accessories</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/iphone-reverse-charging-unlikely-near-future/\">Bloomberg: iPhone Reverse Charging for Apple Watch and AirPods &#039;Unlikely in the Near Future&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-iphone-reverse-charging-for-apple-watch-and-airpods-unlikely-in-the-near-future.2285344/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zMdwHFTkQW0:Ohf-8Hhdau8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zMdwHFTkQW0:Ohf-8Hhdau8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zMdwHFTkQW0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"30a201bea9acc9285bb0089b69b2dfe6fdfd0137d10e4f06e04f717227506a93","category":"Apple"}
