For me, though, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/bont/\">Bont</a> cycling shoes really hit the spot.</p>\n<p>I’ve had this set of Bont Vaypor Classic cycling shoes for over five years now, but despite now owning more than a few pairs of posh road cycling shoes, they remain a pair I reach for over and over when heading out on the bike (or staying in on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a>).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> My set of Bont Vaypor Classic cycling shoes is over 5 years old now, but I still wear them all the time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h2>Shoes that last</h2>\n<p>While many brands have a last that’s relatively narrow in the forefoot, Bont cycling shoes use a last that is (according to the brand) far more anatomical than what most other brands use.</p>\n<p>They certainly look different, with a much roomier toe box being the most obvious area of difference. For some, the way this looks can be a turn-off, but the extra space means I’ve never suffered from cramped toes in a pair of Bont cycling shoes.</p>\n<p>What more people probably associate with Bont cycling shoes is the astronomically stiff, thermo-moldable carbon soles.</p>\n<p>I can honestly say there are few other cycling shoes that can match the feeling of absolute rigidity Bont’s bathtub-shaped soles provide.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bont uses a different, more anatomical last compared to many cycling shoe brands.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The soles also have an exceptionally low stack height of just 3.6mm, which is one of the lowest on the market. For comparison, Shimano’s latest top of the range <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-rc902/\">S-Phyre RC902</a> cycling shoes have a stack height of 4.9mm. A low stack height is desirable as having your foot closer to the pedal can improve your pedalling stability (in theory anyway).</p>\n<p>Of course, whether or not these things actually make any measurable difference to your pedalling efficiency is unclear, but I think they make these shoes feel great.</p>\n<p>When switching back to cycling shoes with a more standard construction style, especially mid-range ones like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/shimano-rc5-road-shoe-review/\">Shimano’s excellent value RC5</a> (which measure a respectable 8 out of 12 on Shimano’s arbitrary stiffness scale), the difference is immediately detectable – in a bad way.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Though it’s not really an apples to apples comparison, the difference in construction between the soles of the two shoes is stark, and it’s not hard to imagine which one is stiffer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, I find the stiffer Bont’s to be a lot more comfortable.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why this is, but stiffer road cycling shoes being more comfortable is something myself and my colleague <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/jackluke/\">Jack Luke</a> appear to agree on.</p>\n<p>If I was to speculate, I think it might be something to do with stiffer soles more evenly distributing the pressure from the pedal (whereas a less-stiff sole would flex around the pedal axle), but I don’t have any evidence to back that up.</p>\n<p>In contrast, I’m also sure that if your cycling shoes don’t fit your feet well, such stiffness may also be more uncomfortable, as any pressure points would be exaggerated. It makes intuitive sense to me that increased stiffness would equate to less margin for error in terms of fit.</p>\n<p>Given this, the fact you can also thermo-mould Bont’s to fit the precise contours of your feet is a massively underrated feature. I’ve taken advantage of it on all three pairs of Bont’s I own.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>BikeRadar’s High-Mileage Heroes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/high-mileage-heroes/\">High-Mileage Heroes</a> is a new series on BikeRadar showcasing the products that have stood the test of time and become part of our everyday riding.</p>\n<p>These aren’t reviews, but rather a chance to talk about the kit we depend on and the products we choose to use when we’re not reviewing fresh gear. </p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Classic looks</h2>\n<p>As for why I like this particular pair so much, it’s mainly because they’re lace-up.</p>\n<p>Around the time I purchased these, lace-up cycling shoes were having a proper revival (mainly thanks to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/phinneys-homemade-custom-giros-at-tour-de-suisse/?image=1&amp;type=gallery&amp;gallery=1&amp;embedded_slideshow=1\">Taylor Phinney</a> and his use of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/giro-empire-acc-shoes-review/\">Giro’s Empire</a> cycling shoes).</p>\n<p>I like lace-up cycling shoes for three reasons. First off, I appreciate the even distribution of pressure you can achieve with laces. Yes, they’re slower to put on and not adjustable on the fly, but neither of those things have ever really bothered me in practise.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Laces look good, are comfortable and potentially more aero – what’s not to like?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Secondly, as there’s no need for ratchets or dials on the outside of the shoe, the aerodynamic profile of the shoe is improved slightly too.</p>\n<p>It’s a small difference, no doubt, but Specialized once claimed that, with a lace-cover in place, its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/specialized-s-works-sub6-shoes-review/\">S-Works Sub6</a> lace-up shoes could save you 35 seconds over 40km versus its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/specialized-s-works-6-shoes-review/\">S-Works 6</a> shoes (which had two Boa dials and a velcro strap).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/bradley-wiggins/\">Bradley Wiggins</a> also used a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/giro-empire-slx-road-shoes-review/\">Giro’s Empire SLX</a> lace-up shoes for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bikeradars-10-defining-cycling-memories-of-2015/\">his successful Hour Record attempt in June 2015</a>, so there’s clearly something in it. As someone who enjoys a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trial</a>, it’s a marginal gain I can’t resist.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and most importantly, I think lace-up cycling shoes just look cool. They’re much simpler and more elegant than ones with Boa dials, which often look a bit fussy with all their various dials, straps and wires.</p>\n<h2>Non, je ne regrette rien</h2>\n<p>If I was to make two small criticisms of the Vaypor Classic’s, it would be that the stock insoles are a bit naff and cleat bolt holes aren’t adjustable. The first of those issues is easily solved, but the latter unfortunately isn’t.</p>\n<p>A greater cleat positional adjustment range would be very much worth the small weight penalty. To be fair, I think Bont may agree, as this is something it has incorporated into the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/bont-helix-road-shoes-review/\">Helix</a>, one of its latest high-end road cycling shoes.</p>\n<p>Although the Durolite and memory foam uppers have remained impressively hardy throughout the years, my set is starting to look a little tatty (especially so after a spill in 2019), so my only regret is that I didn’t buy a second pair.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> My Vaypor Classic’s are starting to show their age now, which causes me immeasurable emotional distress.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This set should last a little while yet. The heel and toe bumpers are replaceable, and even though Bont has since sadly discontinued this model, it does still sell those as spare parts. The laces are also likewise easily replaceable.</p>\n<p>In contrast, on a pair of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/bont-zero-cycling-shoes-review/\">Bont Zero+ cycling shoes</a> I also own, the Atop dial on the right shoe broke, and Bont wasn’t able to supply a spare.</p>\n<p>Not wanting to retire an otherwise perfectly good pair of shoes, I instead removed the dials from both shoes and punched lace holes in the uppers underneath the aero covers. Problem solved, but it’s also a problem I won’t ever have with the Vaypor Classic’s.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> My customised Bont Zero+ cycling shoes – the stock models do not come with laces.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I’m under no illusions my Vaypor Classic’s will last forever though, so I’ve had to look elsewhere for a replacement pair of lace-up cycling shoes (I acquired a set of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/kask-bambino-pro-evo/\">Nimbl’s Air cycling shoes</a> last year, which I’ve grown to appreciate more since replacing the stock insoles).</p>\n<p>If you’re reading this, Bont, please consider releasing an updated version. You’ll have an eager customer here.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9ecbc91f041404e2e1b0c9fac794fb3cb7f515c1e5f6557bec21ceecc7cff9e1","category":"Cycling"}
