The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, which launched last year, has been much more popular thanks to its lower price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple unified its engineering teams for ‌HomePod‌ and ‌Apple TV‌ last year, suggesting an integrated device offering the best of both worlds could be in the offing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, according to today's report, the product's development is still in the early stages, and Apple could choose not to launch the product or change key features. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is known to be working on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/01/new-apple-tv-remote-with-find-my/\">updated version of the Apple TV</a> that will allegedly have a gaming focus with an updated remote control, a faster processor, and increased storage capacity, although it seems likely that today's report is referencing another potential future product. Signs of the new ‌Apple TV‌ have been showing up in iOS since January 2020, so we are expecting to see a new ‌Apple TV‌ launch in 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nToday's report also mentions that Apple is working on a concept for a future ‌HomePod‌ design that has an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/\">iPad connected via a robotic arm</a>, which could follow users around a room during video calls.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/apple-tv-combined-homepod-camera/\">Bloomberg: Apple Working on New Apple TV With Integrated HomePod Speaker and FaceTime Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-apple-working-on-new-apple-tv-with-integrated-homepod-speaker-and-facetime-camera.2291423/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SOSCD7ggPGI:4KRmVSEzr9k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SOSCD7ggPGI:4KRmVSEzr9k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SOSCD7ggPGI\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3ff163e3a27ab6d1dedae2e6f4260875368de81ad2d770b999b3a2e22e69c2f8","category":"Apple"}
