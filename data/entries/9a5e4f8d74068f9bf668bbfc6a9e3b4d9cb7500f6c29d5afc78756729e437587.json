Stewart was riding behind Elia Viviani, who would go on to win the race, as Viviani wound up to speed, when Bouhanni came across from Stewart&#8217;s right. Bouhanni leaned into the 21-year-old Brit and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/nacer-bouhanni-is-still-a-terror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drove him into the barriers</a>. Stewart managed to stay upright, but his hopes for the sprint were dashed, and apparently, he broke his hand as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bouhanni was disqualified for the incident, and Stewart criticized him on Twitter later that day.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BouhanniNacer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BouhanniNacer</a> I would ask you what you was thinking&#8230;but you clearly have no brain cells.
