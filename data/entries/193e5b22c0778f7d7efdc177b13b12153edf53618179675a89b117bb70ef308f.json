Zippers are a classic example when looking at\nbackpacks, clothing, and similar gear. And although there are a\nfew other fine zipper brands out there, the king is <a href=\"https://ykknorthamerica.com/\">YKK Group</a> — to the point that the first thing some gear reviewers look for is\nthe “YKK” branding on the zipper pull tab.</p>\n\n<p>My dad used to do some work for YKK back in the ‘90s, so I wanted\nto dig deeper into why they’re the king and what makes their\nzippers so associated with quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Centers quotes a remark <a href=\"https://recycledfirefighter.com/blogs/news/why-are-ykk-zippers-good\">from a post by Recycled Firefighter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>YKK Zippers are amazing, because they self-lubricate the more you\nuse them. You’ll notice that other brands of zippers become sticky\nand gritty over time. Not with YKK… They will feel more smooth,\nthe more you use them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a hoodie from American Giant that’s a few years old now, and the zipper no longer stays up. It’s not a YKK. I also have a slightly newer hoodie from them — same size — and the zipper always stays up, and, I have noticed, just has a better feel. It’s a YKK.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘YKK Zippers’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/12/ykk-zippers\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"193e5b22c0778f7d7efdc177b13b12153edf53618179675a89b117bb70ef308f","category":"Tech"}
