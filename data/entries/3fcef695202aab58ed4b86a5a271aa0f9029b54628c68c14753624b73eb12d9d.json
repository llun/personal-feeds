The OnePlus 8 was part of the phone-maker's 2020 lineup. Though the OnePlus 8 Pro was bigger in size and spec, the high-level specs on this standard model still make it a decent flagship phone in 2021.\n<p>OnePlus phones have generally appealed to us by offering flagship-level specs and performance for less than the ever-ballooning price of most high-end smartphones. This year’s Prime Day sale takes the $500-600 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xD3FrC\" target=\"_blank\">OnePlus 8 down to $349</a>, a much more competitive price that again gives more expensive (and less expensive) phones a run for their money.</p>\n<p>Just looking at the spec sheet, you can see that—with 5G support (on GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile), a 6.55-inch 402 pixels-per-inch OLED display with a 90 Hz refresh rate, 8GB RAM (albeit of the slower LPDDR4X variety), 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage, and Qualcomm’s 2020 flagship Snapdragon 865 processor—the OnePlus 8 is a phone that remains competitive. Unfortunately, there’s no removable storage, though that's not out of the ordinary in 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775281#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1775281&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3fcef695202aab58ed4b86a5a271aa0f9029b54628c68c14753624b73eb12d9d","category":"Tech"}
