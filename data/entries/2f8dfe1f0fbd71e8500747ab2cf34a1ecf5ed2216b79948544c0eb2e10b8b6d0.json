They’re both designed, Focus says, to release your inner child.</p>\n<p>The updated Focus Jam is a 150mm travel all-mountain trail bike, which Focus says offers agile and direct handling for downhill confidence, paired with easy efficient pedalling. The latest Jam is also said to be more downhill-oriented than its predecessor, with the Thron slotting in to offer a more trail-oriented ride.</p>\n<p>The Jam incorporates Focus’s Flip Chip linkage, which lets you adjust the bike’s geometry and handling. There’s a new, slacker 65.5 degree head tube angle, which the Flip Chip allows you to decrease to 65 degrees. That’s paired to a short 44mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pushing-the-limits-of-fork-offset-an-experiment/\" target=\"_blank\">fork offset</a> for steering agility.</p>\n<div>\n<dl><dt>\n<p></p><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A flip Chip in the suspension linkage lets you alter the Jam’s geometry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus bikes</i></span></div></dt>\n</dl></div>\n<p>The Flip Chip means that the seat tube angle can be increased to 76.5 degrees or set at 76 degrees, while the reach can be increased to 455mm from 450mm for a medium frame.</p>\n<p>The frame’s reach is increased across all four sizes relative to the Jam’s predecessor, with from 10mm extra for a small frame to 45mm for an XL.</p>\n<p>Focus has also updated its suspension design for more feedback and better resistance to bottoming-out. The shock is now positioned horizontally, which gives a lower standover and more space in the front triangle, which Focus uses to provide a frame fit tool bag under the front end of the top tube.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/focus-bikes/\">Focus</a> has also designed an integrated cockpit, which runs the cables internally from the bar into the stem and the frame.</p>\n<p>The Jam is available in three specs, starting at £2,499 for the Jam 6.8, heading to £2,999 for the Jam 6.9 and £4,199 for the Jam 6.0 LTD.</p>\n<h2>Focus Thron</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both the Jam and Thron have integrated cable routing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<p>The Thron is more trail-oriented, with 130mm of travel. Its head tube angle is 66.5 degrees, so it’s a bit steeper than the Jam, while the seat tube angle is 75 degrees and the reach is 10mm shorter, resulting in a similar ride position.</p>\n<p>The Thron shares the Jam’s refreshed suspension design, for more progressive kinematics and good resistance to bottoming out. Also shared with the Jam are the integrated cabling into the stem and the tool storage bag.</p>\n<p>The Thron is available in three specs, starting at £2,199 for the Thron 6.8 and Thron 6.8 EQP and topped by the Thron 6.9 at £2,899.</p>\n<h2>Focus Jam 6.0 LTD specs</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2022 Focus Jam 6.0 Ltd.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Focus</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> 7005 hydroformed aluminium</li>\n<li><strong>Fork: </strong>Rock Shox Lyrik Ultimate RC2 29, 150 mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> RockShox Super Deluxe Select+, 150mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM GX Eagle AXS, 30t, 10-52t</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>DT Swiss EX 511 29”</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Front Maxxis Minion DHF 2.5 3C MaxxGrip EXO+ TR/Rear Maxxis Minion DHR 2.5 3C MaxxTerra EXO+ TR</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Code R, 200mm/180mm rotors</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> Focus C.I.S. integrated, 50 mm</li>\n<li><strong>Handlebar:</strong> RaceFace Chester 35, aluminium</li>\n<li><strong>Grips:</strong> BBB Cobra BHG-96</li>\n<li><strong>Dropper</strong>: Kind Shock RAGE</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Proxim W450</li>\n<li><strong>Colour:</strong> Alloy Brushed Silk Matt</li>\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>15,7 kg</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,199</li>\n</ul><h2>Focus Thron 6.9 specs</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div>\n    <div>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Focus</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n<p>Frame: 7005 hydroformed aluminium</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork: </strong>FOX 34 Float Rhythm 29, 130 mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Shock:</strong> FOX Float DPS Performance, 130mm travel</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> Shimano Deore XT M8100 12-speed, 32t, 10-51t</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>Rodi TRYP25 29” on Novatec hubs</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> F Maxxis Dissector 2.4”/ R Maxxis Rekon 2.4”</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano XT M8120, 180mm rotors</li>\n<li><strong>Stem: </strong>Focus C.I.S. integrated, 50 mm</li>\n<li><strong>Handlebar: </strong>RaceFace Chester 35, aluminium</li>\n<li><strong>Grips:</strong> BBB Cobra BHG-96</li>\n<li><strong>Dropper: </strong>Kind Shock RAGE I</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle: </strong>Focus Trail SL</li>\n<li><strong>Colour: </strong>Mineral Green</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 15.5kg</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£2,899</li>\n</ul>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"2f8dfe1f0fbd71e8500747ab2cf34a1ecf5ed2216b79948544c0eb2e10b8b6d0","category":"Cycling"}
