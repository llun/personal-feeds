Although two Deceuninck-QuickStep riders were among those that hit the deck in a late crash, Deceuninck-QuickStep led the way into the last few hundred meters to set Bennett up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bennett followed his lead out until only a hundred meters remained, and then he launched his sprint. A few moments later, he nabbed the clear win at the line ahead of <strong>Danny van Poppel</strong> and <strong>Jon Aberasturi</strong>.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Volta ao Algarve em Bicicleta (2.Pro)\n                                                    <span>Lagos → Portimão</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255423\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">BENNETT Sam</a>\n                                            <span>Deceuninck -

After spending months recovering from the injuries he suffered in a crash at <strong>Il Lombardia</strong> and then working his way into form for this season, Evenepoel said on Wednesday that he was not sure what to expect at the Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t know how the body will react. I mean, I have no pressure,” Evenepoel said. “The main goal of this season is the Olympics and I always said that the Giro will be part of the road to Tokyo.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bernal ahead of the Giro: ‘Everything will depend on how my back responds’</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In other news of <strong>Giro</strong> contenders who are uncertain about what to expect from the race, <strong>Egan Bernal</strong> emphasized on Wednesday that his performance in the Italian Grand Tour will come down to how his back is feeling. The 24-year-old Colombian has been dealing with lingering back issues since last season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everything will depend on how my back responds. If everything is okay, then I will focus on the overall classification and the fight for the maglia rosa in Milan,” Bernal said, according to <a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/Giroditalia/05-05-2021/ciclismo-intervista-bernal-debutto-giro-d-italia-410731929766_preview.shtml?reason=unauthenticated&amp;origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gazzetta.it%2FGiroditalia%2F05-05-2021%2Fciclismo-intervista-bernal-debutto-giro-d-italia-410731929766.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a>. “We will see day-by-day because I haven’t raced for two months. It’s useless to make false promises.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UAE-Team Emirates signs under-23 talent Felix Gross</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UAE-Team Emirates</strong> announced on Wednesday that it had signed German under-23 talent <strong>Felix Gross</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gross, 22, was Germany’s junior national road champion in 2016 and has enjoyed success on the track, riding to under-23 titles in the individual pursuit and the kilometer time trial at the European championships. He will start with UAE-Team Emirates as a stagiaire later this year before joining the team as a pro from 2022 through 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ayesha McGowan names recipients of Thee Abundance mini-grants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ayesha McGowan</strong> announced the names of nine riders who will receive mini-grants towards racing at the upcoming <strong>Tour of America’s Dairyland</strong>, which will run from June 17 to 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gabriella Allong</strong>, <strong>Rachel Parker</strong>, <strong>Guarina Lopez</strong>, <strong>Bijou Vaultz</strong>, <strong>Carissa Yao</strong>, <strong>Valeria Diaz</strong>, <strong>Ajoa Abrokwa</strong>, <strong>Nicole Young</strong>, and <strong>Uhllana Woods</strong> will receive funding for “entries, housing, transportation, a food stipend, and a few additional resources” for the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you’re looking for tips on how to approach the <strong>CyclingTips Giro Fantasy Competition</strong>, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/preview-your-guide-to-the-2021-giro-ditalia-contenders-sprinters-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">we’ve got you covered</a>.</li><li>Get familiar with the big names set to take on the <strong>Giro</strong> with our <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/preview-your-guide-to-the-2021-giro-ditalia-contenders-sprinters-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">guide to the GC contenders, sprinters, and more</a>.</li><li><strong>Cotic</strong> will make only <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/cotic-tonic-titanium-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">32 limited-edition models</a> of its <strong>Tonic</strong> titanium gravel bike.</li><li><strong>Berk Composites</strong> has created a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/a-sub-4-kg-road-bike-for-everyday-use-berk-composites-says-so/\" target=\"_blank\">sub-4 kg bike</a> that it says is for everyday use.</li><li>This week’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/win-it-weekly-panaracer-gravel-tire-adventure-pack/\" target=\"_blank\">Win It Weekly</a> prize is a <strong>Panaracer</strong> gravel tire adventure pack.</li><li><strong>Canyon</strong> has announced a new <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/canyon-announce-new-speedmax-disc-uci-legal-tt-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">UCI-legal version</a> of its recently updated <strong>Speedmax</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n\n    <div>\n    <div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2>GET THE DAILY NEWS DIGEST DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter your email address to have the Daily News Digest delivered directly to your inbox and receive instant access to comment on any article on CyclingTips.com</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <a>Sign Up</a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n\n\n\n    </div>\n    </div>\n\t\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/bennett-sprints-to-victory-on-stage-1-of-the-volta-ao-algarve-daily-news/\">Bennett sprints to victory on stage 1 of the Volta ao Algarve: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3cfff7e90a514bee5d6373ffad3ea7ef8aa31bf4c697a6674e69386276f86f0f","category":"Cycling"}
