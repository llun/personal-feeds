Proponents point first to long recharging times for lithium-ion batteries and then to the speed with which pressurized hydrogen can be pumped into a car as reasons that battery-electric vehicles are doomed to failure among drivers conditioned by decades of fast refueling stops at gas stations. Mostly, those hydrogen-powered cars use fuel cells to generate electricity that powers an electric motor. But internal combustion engines can burn hydrogen, too, emitting just water as exhaust.</p>\n<p>In 2006, BMW experimented with the Hydrogen 7, a <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15147892/2007-bmw-hydrogen-7-car-news/\">V12-powered 7 Series sedan that could run on either gasoline or hydrogen</a>. It wasn't a huge success; BMW made 100 Hydrogen 7s, and when tested by the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory, they proved to be <a href=\"https://www.anl.gov/article/argonne-tests-find-nearzero-emissions-for-bmw-hydrogen-7\">extremely clean in terms of tailpipe emissions</a>. But hydrogen has a much lower energy density than gasoline, so the hydrogen-powered 7s were extremely inefficient, <a href=\"https://www.bmwblog.com/2016/08/17/bmw-stop-making-hydrogen-7-model/\">averaging just 4.7 mpg (50 L/100 km)</a>.</p>\n<p>As a result, I thought the entire idea of hydrogen-powered internal combustion engines in cars was dead and buriedâ€”until this morning, when I spotted an announcement from Toyota. The Japanese automaker will enter the pro-am endurance racing Super Taikyu Series with a hydrogen-powered Corolla race car, starting with a 24-hour race at Fuji, May 21 to 23.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760863#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760863&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
