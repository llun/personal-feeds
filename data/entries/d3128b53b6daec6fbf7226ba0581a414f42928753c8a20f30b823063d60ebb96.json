Recently, though, purchasable outfits in some high-profile shooters have ended up giving players a distinct in-game advantage, blurring the line between cosmetic and pay-to-win items.</p>\n<p>The latest example of this problem comes from <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. Last year, players who purchased the Season 5 premium battle pass and reached Tier 100 in the game could earn access to <a href=\"https://www.gfinityesports.com/gaming-news/call-of-duty-warzone-how-to-unlock-roze-rook-operator-skin-walkthrough-guide-tutorial-challenges-ps4-ps5-xbox-pc/\">an all-black \"Rook\" skin for the character Roze</a>.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the images above, that skin covers the player from head to toe in skintight black fabric, even including black facepaint around the eyes. It's a striking \"black ops\" look in isolation, but during a game, it can make a player nearly invisible when they're <a href=\"https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/broken-warzone-skin-is-too-hard-to-see-players-arent-happy-about-it-1434968/\">hiding in the abundant dark corners in many maps</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758313#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758313&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d3128b53b6daec6fbf7226ba0581a414f42928753c8a20f30b823063d60ebb96","category":"Tech"}
