(credit: <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/\">Ford</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>On Wednesday night, the Ford Motor Company unveiled its latest pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning. The truck is the hotly anticipated battery-electric version of Ford's bestselling vehicle, and when it goes on sale in mid-2022, it will join the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/ford-mustang-mach-e-review-the-peoples-pony-goes-electric/\">Mustang Mach-E</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/ford-readies-an-all-electric-transit-van-for-us-sales-starting-2022/\">electric Transit van</a> as part of Ford's battery EV lineup.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, President Joe Biden visited Ford's Rouge factory in Michigan and gave the world an impromptu demo of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/politics/biden-ford-test-drive/index.html\">how quickly the F-150 Lightning can accelerate</a>.</p>\n<p>The answer is around four seconds to 60 mph, at least when the truck is fitted with an extended-range battery. But a more important headline figure is the truck's price. Remarkably, Ford is not targeting <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/american-excess-is-back-with-the-1000hp-2022-gmc-hummer-ev-truck/\">the upper end of its consumer base</a> with the F-150 Lightning. Although you'll be able to option a Lightning out the wazoo <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/06/everything-we-know-about-the-new-ford-f-150-truck-including-the-hybrid/\">like you can with any other F-150</a>, Ford will sell basic models with the (smaller) standard battery pack, aimed at commercial use, for $39,974 before tax credits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766120#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766120&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
