XCSSET used what at the time were two zero-days to infect Mac developers with malware that stole browser cookies and files; injected backdoors into websites; stole information from Skype, Telegram, and other installed apps; took screenshots; and encrypted files and showed a ransom note.</p>\n<h2>A third zero-day</h2>\n<p>Infections came in the form of malicious projects that the attacker wrote for Xcode, a tool that Apple makes available for free to developers writing apps for macOS or other Apple OSes. As soon as one of the XCSSET projects was opened and built, TrendMicro said, the malicious code would run on the developersâ€™ Macs. An Xcode project is a repository for all the files, resources, and information needed to build an app.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767247#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"65abc0d5147c12e38fc42db0f266343ae3e9503c845a52f55d386afa6e3a239f","category":"Tech"}
