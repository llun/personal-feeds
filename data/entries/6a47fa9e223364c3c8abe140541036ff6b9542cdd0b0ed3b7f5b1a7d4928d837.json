With the initial three M1 Apple silicon Mac models nearly five months old, there's hope that additional updates—potentially even faster than the first M1 Macs—could appear as soon as April, though they might not be out until the fall.</p><p>Not all of us will have the budget to upgrade when they do appear, but we might still feel jealous of the speed. If you’ve got a Mac that uses a Fusion drive—or, even slower, a hard disk drive—as its startup volume, there is a way to add zest to it, and the improvement may shock you.</p><p>Starting a few macOS releases ago, Apple improved its management and use of RAM, resulting in less swapping of active software to a drive and back, which particularly slows down a Mac with an hard drive or Fusion drive. If you have a Mac that allows for easy RAM upgrades, that’s a place to start to get a speed boost. RAM prices for Macs that are upgradable remain low relative to the value provided—$100 or $200 could provide a good boost.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3611669/a-fusion-macs-speed-getting-you-down-give-it-a-boost-with-an-external-ssd.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Glenn Fleishman","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6a47fa9e223364c3c8abe140541036ff6b9542cdd0b0ed3b7f5b1a7d4928d837","category":"Apple"}
