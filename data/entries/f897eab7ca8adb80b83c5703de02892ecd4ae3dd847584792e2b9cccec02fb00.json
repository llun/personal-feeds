{"title":"ThinkPad X1 Nano: Lenovo’s 2-Pound Laptop","link":"https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs","date":1618270852000,"content":"\n<p>Monica Chin, writing for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you’ve used a ThinkPad before, you probably know 90 percent of\nwhat to expect from the ThinkPad X1 Nano. All of the staples are\nhere. It’s got the black carbon fiber chassis, the discrete\nbuttons on top of the touchpad, the mechanical privacy shutter,\nthe ThinkPad logo on the palm rest, and (of course) the red\npointer nub in the middle of the keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>But one thing is unique about the X1 Nano: it’s the lightest\nThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. Starting at just 1.99 pounds, the\nNano isn’t technically the lightest laptop on the market. But it’s\nstill one of the best combinations of portability, build quality,\nand performance that you can buy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now here’s a PC laptop that truly catches my eye. If I had to use a PC laptop, I’d use a ThinkPad. But that 2 pound weight<sup>*</sup> — that’s something Apple currently does not compete with. An M1 MacBook Air weighs 2.8 pounds (and an M1 MacBook Pro weights just 0.2 pounds more — the Air is only ever-so-slightly lighter than the 13-inch Pro).</p>\n\n<p>How about this? My 11-inch iPad Pro attached to Apple’s Magic Keyboard: 2.36 pound. Lenovo’s X1 Nano even has <em>that</em> beat on weight, and the ThinkPad has a 13-inch display and full-size keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Apple <em>did</em> sell a 2-pound laptop once: the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/SP757\">12-inch no-adjective MacBook</a> that was available from 2015–2019. That 12-inch MacBook was beloved by some people I know, specifically because it was so damn light. But even folks who loved it admit it was severely compromised performance-wise.</p>\n\n<p>Surely, Apple is going to come out with an Apple Silicon MacBook that runs really fast, lasts long on battery, and weighs 2 pounds (or less). It’ll make today’s M1 MacBook Air feel like a brick. It just can’t stand for long that Apple is so far behind the PC state-of-the-art in lightweight laptops.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Worth noting that Lenovo sells the X1 Nano with two different screens, one a touchscreen, and one not. The touchscreen model weighs 2.14 pounds.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/thinkpad-x1-nano\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f897eab7ca8adb80b83c5703de02892ecd4ae3dd847584792e2b9cccec02fb00","category":"Tech"}
