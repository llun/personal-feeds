Not the fixed, unanimated stare one normally associates with the grainy black and white photographs of cyclists from the ‘heroic era’. This is an entirely different expression.

His first victory came after a typically audacious 160km breakaway. Total domination that humiliated the rest of the field. He podiumed eleven times in Sanremo and was robbed of almost certain victory not once, but twice. Cruel circumstance dictated that a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cannibale</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from a later era would wear the crown for the most wins in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Classicissima di Primavera.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Precociously talented, Girardengo’s potential was evident from as early as 1913, the year he won the first of his nine (consecutive) Italian championships and competed in his first Giro d’Italia at the age of 20. The following year he won the longest ever Giro stage – a mere 430km – and a few weeks later he made his one and only appearance at the Tour de France, abandoning during Stage Six.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/milan-san-remo-2021-preview\">Related: Milan San Remo 2021 Preview</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no surprise that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Classicissima</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is so finely woven into Girardengo’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">palmarès</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To this day, the race runs southwest from Milan through Piedmont, passing through Girardengo’s hometown of Novi Ligure and over the Passo del Turchino to the relative warmth of the Ligurian coast. In a later edition Girardengo recalled hearing his children cheering him on as he sped through Novi, willing him to win. They were not disappointed.  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-64437\" src=\"https://rouleur.cc/editorial/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.GP-Wolber-1924-001-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Constante Girardengo\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.GP-Wolber-1924-001-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.GP-Wolber-1924-001-200x300.jpg 200w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.GP-Wolber-1924-001-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.GP-Wolber-1924-001-1200x1800.jpg 1200w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.GP-Wolber-1924-001.jpg 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\"><em>Girardengo pictured after winning the GP Wolber in 1924, having beaten home favourite, Henri Pélissier of France, into second place.

He would later nurture the career of Coppi from his base in the city, but Cavanna’s first protégé was the young Girardengo, honing his talents and refining his race preparation, training and tactics and guiding him towards a life of notoriety and fame. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there is the simple fact that the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">parcours</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Milan – San Remo offered the perfect battlefield for Girardengo to unleash his armoury. In a bunch sprint, few could match his speed. Small in stature – he was nicknamed ‘The Novi Runt’ by some – but immensely powerful, yet able to keep in touch with the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scalatori</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the hills.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/2021-procycling-calendar\">Related: The 2021 Men's Early Season: The Rouleur Racing Guide</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His 30 Giro stage wins, nine Italian Championship titles, along with his many Classic triumphs, including victory in three Giro di Lombardias, are testimony that Girardengo could be a danger in any terrain. Yet it was on the cumulative, undulating climbs of Milan – San Remo that he excelled and if any of his rivals could stay with him to the death, it would inevitably be Girardengo’s smiling face that would grace the front pages of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">La Gazzetta dello Sport.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If his 1918 Milan – San Remo victory propelled Girardengo into the wider public consciousness, then his demolition of the field in the 1919 Giro cemented their adulation. He led after Stage One and never relinquished it, adding another six stage wins in the process. His victory was even more impressive, and unexpected, as Girardengo had almost succumbed to the deadly Spanish flu epidemic that swept across Europe in the latter stages of the war.  Some, including his own Bianchi team, doubted whether he could ever recapture the form necessary to compete at the highest level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://rouleur.cc/editorial/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.1926-M-SR.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64392\" src=\"https://rouleur.cc/editorial/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.1926-M-SR.jpg\" alt=\"Constante Girardengo\" width=\"800\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.1926-M-SR.jpg 800w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.1926-M-SR-300x210.jpg 300w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.1926-M-SR-768x539.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\"></a><em>Supported by fans, and exhausted looking Girardengo after crossing the line to win the 1926 edition of Milan – Sanremo</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Girardengo would only win one further Giro, in 1923. It is likely he would have won more, but the suspension of the race during the war years, coupled with the unforgiving nature of bike racing in this era and disputes over appearance money with the Giro organisers conspired against him. And then, just as Girardengo’s powers began to diminish, Italian cycling witnessed the emergence of Alfredo Binda, the young pretender destined to take on the mantle of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campionissimo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was rather poignant that Girardengo’s final Milan – San Remo victory in 1928, when he narrowly outsprinted a complacent Binda in atrocious conditions, was arguably his greatest. It proved to be the final major win of his career and the last telling punch of this seasoned pugilist.  </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/desire-passoni-fidia-milano-sanremo\">Related: Passoni Fidia: Milan- San Remo edition</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He continued to race into the mid-1930’s and in retirement launched his own bike brand and even a stable of motorcycles bearing his name. He remained a ubiquitous presence on the race scene until his death in 1978, managing domestic squads and, most famously, the Italian team that delivered the emphatic 1938 Tour de France victory of Gino Bartali.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://rouleur.cc/editorial/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.Track-portrait.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-64402\" src=\"https://rouleur.cc/editorial/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.Track-portrait.jpg\" alt=\"Constante Girardengo\" width=\"683\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.Track-portrait.jpg 683w, https://journal.rouleur.cc/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Girardengo.Track-portrait-280x300.jpg 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px\"></a><em>Cycling became an increasingly lucrative sport in the post-war years, with generous purses on offer to the leading riders.
