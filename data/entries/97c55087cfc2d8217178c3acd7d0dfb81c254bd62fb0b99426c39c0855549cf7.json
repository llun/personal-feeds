The dark mode update should also make 1Password dialogs sit more harmoniously with websites that adopt dark themes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/save_new_item-1password.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother significant change for subscribers appears in the save window, which now shows everything that will be added to a new item, and allows users to adjust the contents and add tags to stay organized. The password generator also now suggests strong passwords that fit the requirements of the website being viewed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nVersion 2.0.0/2.0.1 of 1Password for browsers also includes a giant list of changes, fixes, and improvements, all of which you can find on the <a href=\"https://releases.1password.com/b5x/stable/#whats-new\">new 1Password release page</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/1password/\">1Password</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/agilebits/\">AgileBits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/27/1password-touch-id-dark-mode-web/\">1Password on the Web Gains Touch ID Support, Dark Mode, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1password-on-the-web-gains-touch-id-support-dark-mode-and-more.2298042/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ADcCrLYKDgk:OAzOHZY4p8M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ADcCrLYKDgk:OAzOHZY4p8M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ADcCrLYKDgk\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"97c55087cfc2d8217178c3acd7d0dfb81c254bd62fb0b99426c39c0855549cf7","category":"Apple"}
