In a photo, actor Justin Long sits on a couch with a Windows PC and holds up a handful of Apple dongles.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone know who these belong to? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/W6wCfMSEb8\">pic.twitter.com/W6wCfMSEb8</a></p>&mdash; Intel (@intel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1372563446735196164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's Macs have long been derided for their lack of ports and the need to use dongles for various accessories and displays. Since 2016, Macs have included only USB-C ports, with Apple having done away with HDMI ports, USB-A ports, and SD card readers in its notebook lineup. That's set to change in 2021, though, with rumors suggesting Apple will introduce <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">new MacBook Pro models</a> that once again feature an SD card reader and an HDMI port.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, who shared Apple's future port plans in January, said that in the future, \"most users may not need to purchase additional dongles.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe ad follows several anti-M1 Mac videos that Intel shared yesterday starring Justin Long, who used to be in the well-known \"I'm a Mac\" Apple ads. In the videos, Long promotes Intel-based PCs, highlighting their gaming capabilities, touchscreens, and other features.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9gtRRMd2_UI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nIntel's ads come as Apple is moving away from Intel chips in its Mac lineup. Apple in November released the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and there are more Apple silicon chips on the way. Over the course of the next two years, Apple plans to transition away from Intel chips entirely.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Justin Long ads are not the first anti-Apple ads that Intel has shared. In February, Intel began a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/intel-anti-mac-ad-campaign/\">Twitter-based campaign</a> attempting to point out the shortcomings of &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs. Intel appears to be feeling threatened by Apple's chip options. &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips received a huge amount of attention at launch due to their impressive speed and efficiency, which Intel chips are unable to match.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Only a PC offers tablet mode, touch screen and stylus capabilities in a single device. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPC</a></p>&mdash; Intel (@intel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1356633480776531968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has even faster chips on the way, and there will be little for Intel to call out once MacBook Pro models with next-generation Apple silicon chips and a range of ports are available.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/intel-anti-dongle-m1-mac-ad/\">Intel Dunks on Apple&#039;s Dongles in Continued Anti-M1 Mac Campaign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intel-dunks-on-apples-dongles-in-continued-anti-m1-mac-campaign.2288790/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wYLAeT1zEbg:eoWYA53Awlg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wYLAeT1zEbg:eoWYA53Awlg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wYLAeT1zEbg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3bf4714251a3b52be45ccfe531bc6c7e081ea90f11c3d9c68f6d060d5c82d7d6","category":"Apple"}
