It connects to an ‌iPad Pro‌ using the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a>, so there's no need for pairing or charging a battery.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Combo Touch is sized to fit Apple's newest iPads, with separate options available for older tablets.
