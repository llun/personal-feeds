A sweeping left hand corner put the wind at the rider&#8217;s back right, and Pedersen followed the wheel of teammate Jasper Stuyven up the protected left side. He timed his launch to perfection, taking the win by a bike length. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony Turgis (Total Direct Energie) and a flying Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) crossed the line in second and third. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More to come. </em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/daily-news-mads-pedersen-wins-kuurne-brussels-kuurne/\">Mads Pedersen wins Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"79475025c9fd8f0da8d5774bca61897a1328f02a3b195a8e4ec47fb9307d0c3c","category":"Cycling"}
