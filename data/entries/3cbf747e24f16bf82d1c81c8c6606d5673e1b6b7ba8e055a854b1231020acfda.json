The second betas add some new features, including new emoji, an option for Apple Music subscribers to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/apple-music-share-lyrics-ios-14-5-beta-2/\">share song lyrics on platforms like iMessage and Instagram</a>, a new action for taking a screenshot in the Shortcuts app, and more. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/everything-new-ios-14-5-beta-2/\">We've rounded up everything new in this beta</a>, including hidden code changes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/14.5-on-iPhone-12-feature-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783940\" />\r\n<br/>\r\niOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 are packed with many other features, such as the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch/\">unlock an iPhone with an Apple Watch while wearing a mask</a>, support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-enables-5g-in-dual-sim-mode/\">5G in Dual-SIM mode</a> on iPhone 12 models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/ios-14-5-apple-maps-crowdsourcing-accidents/\">new Waze-like features in Apple Maps</a>, and AirPlay 2 streaming for Apple Fitness+ workouts, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-fitness-airplay-enabled-ios-14-5-beta-2/\">became functional in the second beta</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\niOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 should be released to all users in late March or early April, but anyone can sign up to be a public beta tester for free to gain early access to all of these new features.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>watchOS 7.3.1 Released With Fix for Apple Watch Series 5 and Apple Watch SE Charging Issue</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn a new support document this week, Apple said a \"very small number of customers\" with Apple Watch Series 5 or Apple Watch SE models running watchOS 7.2 or 7.3 have experienced an issue with their watch not charging after it enters Power Reserve.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-watch-power-reserve.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783752\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple says customers with an Apple Watch that is exhibiting this issue can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/apple-free-repairs-apple-watch-power-reserve-bug/\">contact Apple support to set up a mail-in repair free of charge</a>. Apple has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/apple-releases-watchos-7-3-1/\">released watchOS 7.3.1, which prevents this issue</a> from happening to Apple Watch Series 5 or Apple Watch SE units that have yet to be impacted.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/apple-seeds-watchos-7-4-beta-2-to-developers/\">second betas of watchOS 7.4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/apple-seeds-tvos-14-5-beta-2-to-developers/\">tvOS 14.5</a> have also been seeded to developers and public beta testers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>iPhone 13 Rumored to Include Always-On Display With 120Hz ProMotion, Astrophotography Capabilities, Stronger MagSafe, and More</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile we're still many months away from the so-called iPhone 13 lineup, rumors are beginning to surface about potential features for the devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iPhone-13-Always-On-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783719\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe latest word comes from leaker Max Weinbach, who teamed up with YouTube channel EverythingApplePro to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">share some alleged iPhone 13 features, including an always-on display</a> with a long-awaited 120Hz refresh rate, improved camera capabilities for astrophotography, stronger MagSafe magnets, and an improved frosted glass finish that is \"grippier\" and \"more comfortable\" to hold compared to iPhone 12 models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWeinbach has a hit-and-miss track record with Apple rumors. He was among the several sources who incorrectly claimed that iPhone 12 models would feature a 120Hz display, and his rumor about 4K video recording at up to 240 fps also failed to materialize last year, but he did accurately reveal that iPhone 12 models would be available in a new dark blue color.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Apple Says Some iPhone 12 Hardware Issues Will No Longer Require Replacing the Entire Device</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn an internal memo this week, obtained by MacRumors, Apple informed service providers that it will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/iphone-12-same-unit-repairs/\">introducing a new same-unit repair method for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models</a> exhibiting certain issues that would typically require a whole-unit replacement.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone-12-blue-aluminum.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-766208\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple said technicians will be able to offer same-unit repairs starting Tuesday, February 23 for iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 models that are unable to be powered on or are experiencing issues with the logic board, Face ID system, or the enclosure of the device, such as cracked rear glass. The new repair method will be available in all countries and regions where the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 are sold.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGenius Bars and Apple Authorized Service Providers will have a new \"iPhone Rear System\" part available to them that consists of the rear enclosure of an iPhone with all components except the display and rear camera, including the battery, logic board, Taptic Engine, Face ID system, and so forth.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf a customer has an iPhone 12 mini with cracked rear glass, for example, technicians will be able to replace the entire rear portion of the device, with the new enclosure affixed to the original display and rear camera. For this reason, the customer's display and rear camera must be free of damage or functional failures in order for their device to qualify.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Useful iPhone Tips You Might Not Know</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn one of our latest YouTube videos, we've <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/iphone-tips-february-2021/\">rounded up some useful iPhone tips and tricks</a>, and they are worth checking out for both new and longtime users. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/airdrop-thumbnail-feature-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2977\" height=\"1675\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783461\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nFor instance, did you know that you can create a quick shortcut for turning on Low Power Mode when the battery dips to a specific percentage?
