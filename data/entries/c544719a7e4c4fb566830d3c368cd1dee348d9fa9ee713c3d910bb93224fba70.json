Rapha has launched its first ever mountain bike collection, the Rapha Performance Trailwear collection, taking that famous stripe firmly off-road.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9708/rapha-performance-trailwear-mountain-bike-range-images#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 28</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/dsc_9686.jpg?itok=Ed1PVmS7\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>28</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Rapha says, 'In the beginning, we focussed on road racing but for as long as we've been designing for riders on the road, we've also been a pioneering force off it. We've raised the bar in technical apparel for adventures far beyond the tarmac, and now we're going even further.'</p>\n<h3>Trailing ahead</h3>\n<p>This isn't just a minor launch, the range is quite extensive with all areas covered and options for men and women.</p>\n<p>'The beauty of mountain biking for us lies in the commitment, the repetition, and the countless hours it takes to cast your own progression on the trail,' the brand says, and it has carried that philosophy into the design of the new pieces, with durability and comfort taking high priority.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9708/rapha-performance-trailwear-mountain-bike-range-images#7\"><p><span>Image 8 of</span> 28</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/dsc_1209_edit_2.jpg?itok=0Gr6Fm8q\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 8 of </span>28</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>As well as offering free repairs for damaged kit – Rapha claims to have fixed over 34,000 garments in its history – with most of the new products you'll also get a repair patch kit made from excess fabric that would otherwise go to landfill to allow for easy at-home fixes that both extends the life of the kit but helps minimise the environmental impact.</p>\n<p>On a similar note, Rapha also claims that 43% of its Performance Trailwear range is made using 'environmentally preferred materials' and has committed to increasing that to 90% by 2025.</p>\n<p>Among the features of its lightweight clothing is trail shirts with snag resistance and fast wicking, breathable cargo shorts with a comfortable chamois and rear pockets. </p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/pinarello/dogma/7837/pinarello-dogma-f12-disk-review\">Pinarello Dogma F12 Disk review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/7511/pinarello-prince-fx-disk-ultegra-review\">Pinarello Prince FX Disk Ultegra review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 114: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe range also covers accessories, including a three-litre hip pack;
