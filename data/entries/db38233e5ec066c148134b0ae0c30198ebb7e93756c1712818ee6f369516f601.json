If you chose Spotify, for example, the music content will play in Spotify.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will tell you which music app was selected when the song plays, and you can also see an icon from the music app in the Now Playing window.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/spotify-music-player.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1484\" height=\"1271\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782620\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's been possible to play music from other services by clarifying which service you want &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to use, such as \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, play music on Spotify,\" but the change implemented in iOS 14.5 makes the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; default your music app of choice so a simple command like \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; play music\" will use your favorite app rather than defaulting to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNote that if you're not seeing the option to select a default music service, you may need to restart your device. Some users have also reported being unable to get the setting to surface, so it's possible not all users will see it in this beta. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>How to Change Your Default Music Service</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nAt the current time, there's no &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; command or music setting to manually change the default music app that you've set through the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to play music on a different music service and sometimes that will shift the default. So if you've set Spotify as your default but want to change back to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, you can say \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, play Fleetwood Mac on &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;,\" or vice versa, \"Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, play Fleetwood Mac on Spotify.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis will sometimes change the default music setting, but it's not entirely reliable. You can also sometimes get the list to reappear by asking about different services in quick succession or when downloading a new music service app, but for now, if you want a hassle-free experience, make sure to set it to the music service that your use most often.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe expect Apple to flesh out the feature further in future betas, so it's likely that there will eventually be a toggle to set a music app as the default across iOS, similar to how the settings work for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/21/gmail-default-mail-app-ios/\">default mail</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/google-chrome-default-browser-ios/\">browser apps</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/change-default-music-app-ios/\">How to Change Your Default Music App in iOS 14.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-change-your-default-music-app-in-ios-14-5.2284027/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=B5-cfR6phO4:_EcTxpv8TC4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=B5-cfR6phO4:_EcTxpv8TC4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/B5-cfR6phO4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db38233e5ec066c148134b0ae0c30198ebb7e93756c1712818ee6f369516f601","category":"Apple"}
