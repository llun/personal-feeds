Apple's modern iPads attach magnetically to the stand, putting the ‌iPad‌ at an ideal viewing angle for pairing with a keyboard, drawing, watching shows, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe stand features strong built-in magnets that ensure the ‌iPad‌ is perfectly aligned when it's put in place, and anti-slip silicone keeps the ‌iPad‌ from being scratched.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/lululook-ipad-stand-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can use the Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand in either landscape or portrait mode, and it has a 360-degree adjustable angle so you can position it any way that you want.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDesign wise, the Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand is made from an aluminum alloy material that matches well with Apple devices, so it looks good on a desk or table. Non-slip feet at the bottom of the stand keep it stable and make sure that it's not going to move around while in use.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/lululook-ipad-stand-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand works well with double-sided magnetic cases, but in most cases, it's best to use it with a naked ‌iPad‌ as a case without a magnet weakens the connection. This is a great solution if you're looking for a more affordable alternative to something like Apple's Magic Keyboard because you can use the Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand with any Bluetooth keyboard that you have on hand.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stand is compatible with all 11-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, the third, fourth, and fifth-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models, and the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models. Those are all of Apple's most recent iPads, including the versions that came out in 2020 and 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/lululook-ipad-stand-4.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have 10 Magnetic ‌iPad‌ Stands to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
