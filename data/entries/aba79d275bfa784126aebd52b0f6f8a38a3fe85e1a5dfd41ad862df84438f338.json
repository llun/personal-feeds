COVID-19 robbed us of many, many things in 2020, including so much of what's great about this time of year—travel, time in parks or at a seashore, afternoons by a pool or lake. But as vaccination rates continue to climb, there's hope that 2021 can have a more genuine summer experience.</p>\n<p>Venturing back into the world also means more opportunities to do so with a paperback or eBook in tow. So the Ars staff is back to provide another glimpse into what we've been reading and what's on our TBR lists as of late. From graphic novels to Hugo Award-winning authors to deep dives into topics you've probably read about here, there's no shortage of great 2021 options regardless of your typical reading habits. Plus, any time you can shout out a classic piece of literature by saying it's full of \"throat-jabs of prose,\" you might be obligated to put together a list of book recommendations.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.</em></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776798#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776798&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aba79d275bfa784126aebd52b0f6f8a38a3fe85e1a5dfd41ad862df84438f338","category":"Tech"}
