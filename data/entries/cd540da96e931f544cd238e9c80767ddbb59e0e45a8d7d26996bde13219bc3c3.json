He’s clearly a prodigious talent, with monstrous power and exceptional ability to suffer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But stage 11 of the 2021 Tour de France – a route that included two ascents of the fearsome Mont Ventoux  – was probably not one the pundits had pencilled van Aert’s name onto. One for the pure climbers, surely. And van Aert, well – a week ago, he’d finished fourth in the time trial. A day ago, he’d finished second in a sprint finish behind Mark Cavendish.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /><figcaption>Mark Cavendish wins stage 10 of the Tour de France, with Wout van Aert on the right of picture.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, though, the Belgian jumped in the breakaway and stuck with the pace on the first ascent of the infamous climb. Second time round – the tougher way – he attacked. He went, and there was no answer – not from the far-smaller Kenny Elissonde, not from World Champion Julian Alaphilippe. Van Aert was there and then he was not, off the front and away, a 78 kg slab of Belgian national champion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the bleached white slopes of the infamous climb, he maintained a monstrous pace, extending his lead over what would eventually be a Trek-Segafredo duo of Elissonde and Bauke Mollema. On the descent, he nudged 100 km/h, and by day’s end, he was a surprising victor on one of the Tour’s toughest days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how much of a surprise was it, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2470738231/segments/62204845720\">A glance back to 2019</a> shows that van Aert today knew Mont Ventoux better than many might have given him credit for. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 22, the Belgian was in the final days of his tune-up for his debut Tour de France start. In the 2019 Tour de France, remember, he won a stage in a sprint, won a stage in a team time trial, and was on his way to a big result in an individual time trial before he had <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/07/the-corner-that-ended-wout-van-aerts-tour-de-france/\">a terrible crash in Pau</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago, before all of that, van Aert rode all three sides of Mont Ventoux in one day – averaging 27.2 km over a 205 km day with 5,674 m of climbing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s 2021 and that’s in the past. After two years of crashes and rehabilitation and wins and appendicitis and first-time fatherhood, Wout van Aert rode his way through a brutal day of climbing and executed a remarkable stage win. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Maybe it’s my best victory ever,” he said afterward, a little dazed. The world of cycling was a little dazed too – but we can’t say the writing wasn’t on the wall.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/wout-van-aert-has-conquered-mont-ventoux-before/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"cd540da96e931f544cd238e9c80767ddbb59e0e45a8d7d26996bde13219bc3c3","category":"Cycling"}
