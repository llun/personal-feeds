Five years later, the company continues to provide dog owners with the kind of food they’re proud to feed their four-legged friends. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul><li>You’ll introduce your dog and answer a few questions about your pet, such as: <em>How active are they? How many treats do they get?</em> From there, the team will create the ideal plan.</li>\n<li>Your dog’s perfectly portioned meals will be delivered to your door frozen to lock in freshness. They’ll arrive in insulated boxes at a time that suits you.</li>\n<li>If you want to update your dog’s information, change the pouch size or pause deliveries, it’s easy to do. With Butternut Box, you’re never locked into a commitment.</li>\n</ul><p>Prices vary depending on your plan and frequency of delivery, but Butternut Box is cheaper than you might think! Here are what the average prices per day look like:</p>\n<ul><li>Small dog (7kg) £1.60</li>\n<li>Medium dog (15kg) £2.60</li>\n<li>Large dog (32kg) £3.92</li>\n</ul><p>Offer ends 09/08/21.
