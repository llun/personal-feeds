{"title":"Tim Cook's Compensation Was Comparatively Modest Among Highest-Paid CEOs of 2020","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/tim-cooks-pay-modest-among-highest-paid-ceos/","date":1622551195000,"content":"Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>'s 14 million dollar pay in 2020 was relatively modest, compared to other S&amp;P 500 CEOs, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-tesla-to-ge-see-how-much-ceos-made-in-2020-11622539802\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/tim-cook-toronto-star.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn its annual ranking of CEO pay and compensation, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> revealed that ‌Tim Cook‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-ceo-tim-cook-2020-earnings/\">earned $14,769,259 last year</a>, which is only slightly more than the median $13.4 million pay across the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) index. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> also noted that Apple's median employee pay is $57,783.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple tops the entire S&amp;P 500 with its value exceeding more than two trillion dollars, so it is surprising that Cook's pay is comparatively modest. Cook's pay rank is the 171st highest out of the S&amp;P 500 CEOs, even though Apple makes up six percent of the entire index.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn increasing number of CEO compensation packages are tied to stocks as boards look to tie executive pay to the fortunes of company shareholders. Although Apple's one-year return for shareholders was 109 percent in 2020, Cook's pay only increased by 28 percent. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOver the course of 2020, Cook's net worth climbed to over one billion dollars, according to calculations from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/tim-cook-net-worth-1-billion/\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe highest-paid CEO was Paycom Software's Chad Richison, who earned more than $200 million. Seven CEOs were given compensation valued at more than $50 million last year, compared with just two in 2019 and three in 2018. Twenty-four S&amp;P 500 CEOs made less than five million dollars last year, including Tesla's Elon Musk, who reported zero pay, and Twitter's Jack Dorsey, who earned just $1.40.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/tim-cooks-pay-modest-among-highest-paid-ceos/\">Tim Cook's Compensation Was Comparatively Modest Among Highest-Paid CEOs of 2020</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cooks-compensation-was-comparatively-modest-among-highest-paid-ceos-of-2020.2298740/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RNKuuHgbXTk:R0zBDuqGwwE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RNKuuHgbXTk:R0zBDuqGwwE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RNKuuHgbXTk\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b896a81ce737d9ebf1235f83da62656232cb3e23c95a9b0cdd44be9346693d6","category":"Apple"}
