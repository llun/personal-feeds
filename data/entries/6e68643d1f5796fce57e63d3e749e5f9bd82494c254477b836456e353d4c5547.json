The rating box could not be escaped from and it was not possible to tap the one or two-star ratings for most users, according to Eleftheriou.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>If you think you can trust â€ŒApp Storeâ€Œ ratings, you havenâ€™t been paying enough attention. <br /><br />This is the iOS *system* rating prompt, not a custom look-alike one.<br /><br />The worst part?

The app now appears to have been removed from the â€ŒApp Storeâ€Œ.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEleftheriou has previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/\">brought attention</a> to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/developer-highlights-scam-apps-iap/\">scam and copycat apps</a> on the â€ŒApp Storeâ€Œ and raised concerns that Apple is not doing enough to stop these apps during its â€ŒApp Storeâ€Œ review process. Eleftheriou experienced the difficulty of contending with scam apps with his own FlickType Apple Watch keyboard app, which was mired by scam copycats that Apple was allegedly reluctant to remove.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, Eleftheriou <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/apple-hit-with-lawsuit-from-developer/\">brought a lawsuit against Apple</a> for a variety of allegations related to his experience with FlickType, including negligence and anticompetitive conduct.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/app-store-scam-app-required-a-good-review/\">App Store Scam App Required a Good Review to Function at All</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/app-store-scam-app-required-a-good-review-to-function-at-all.2297909/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zezeQ7j1P94:23n3Nm6eWT4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zezeQ7j1P94:23n3Nm6eWT4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zezeQ7j1P94\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e68643d1f5796fce57e63d3e749e5f9bd82494c254477b836456e353d4c5547","category":"Apple"}
