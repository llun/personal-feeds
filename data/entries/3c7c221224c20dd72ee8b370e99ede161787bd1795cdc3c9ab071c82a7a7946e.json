Then, they told me the embargo would lift today. I proceeded to chug a concentrated energy drink cocktail of Bawls, Red Bull, and lukewarm coffee grounds while taping my eyelids open so I could bring you a full review of all three touched-up <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mass-effect/\"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> games. Every romance option, every side quest, every unnecessarily rude conversation-wheel option: Sure, let's shotgun the whole thing like an M-11 Wraith in <em>ME3</em>.</p>\n<p>...or, uh, maybe not.</p>\n<p>Clearly, that was not enough turnaround time for a \"full\" review. And a full review is arguably unnecessary anyway, since you don't need us to tell you that the <em>source</em> games in question are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/01/mass-effect-2-review/\">very</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/05/re-review-mass-effect-pc/\">very</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/mass-effect-3-reviewed/\">good</a>. Yet EA is otherwise letting us run wild with <em>MELE</em> coverage starting right now, ahead of the remastered trilogy's retail launch tomorrow. So I've found enough time to go through Ars-caliber tests of the package's technical makeup, putting everything through the paces on multiple PCs and Xbox consoles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764076#p3\">Read 39 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764076&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3c7c221224c20dd72ee8b370e99ede161787bd1795cdc3c9ab071c82a7a7946e","category":"Tech"}
