Apple hasn't used the same Jet Black finish for another phone to date, but according to images shared today by leaker Mr. White, Apple tested a Jet Black &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">They have tried &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X Jet Black before <a href=\"https://t.co/md5p9nNER3\">pic.twitter.com/md5p9nNER3</a></p>&mdash; MrÂ·White (@laobaiTD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laobaiTD/status/1370453717053411329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X was available in a silver color that was close to white and a space gray color that was quite dark, but it was not as dark as the Jet Black color shown off in the prototype photos.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe alleged prototype device does not have an Apple logo or other certification marks, nor a finished camera design, but it is otherwise identical to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X. It's not clear if Apple will bring back the Jet Black colorway in the future, but Apple has been using a standard black color for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> and 12 models.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-prototyped-jet-black-iphone-x/\">Apple Prototyped a Jet Black iPhone X</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-prototyped-a-jet-black-iphone-x.2288131/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=owwShw2myHI:gcDVgFQx5uk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=owwShw2myHI:gcDVgFQx5uk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/owwShw2myHI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e66b4be654cc65c8ca9f014c4bc58aabfd03cd7e018df553aa13c482228e1e3","category":"Apple"}
