The 33-year-old from Western Australia will stay home with his family after his father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Some unfortunate news, I am sad to say I have had to withdraw myself from the Australian Cycling Team for the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games,” Meyer was quoted on the website of AusCycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Due to family health reasons where my father is continuing to battle Stage 4 Brain Cancer and with the difficult travel restrictions around the COVID pandemic, I believe I am unable to represent my country in Tokyo at 100%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Olympics are a special privilege for any athlete, and I would not feel right knowing my condition was not where it needed to be due to my current circumstances. I look forward to spending some quality time with my family during this difficult period and will be cheering on what I’m sure will be a successful Australian Olympic Team.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meyer was scheduled to race the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/australian-road-team-revealed-for-tokyo-olympics/\">Olympic road race</a> together with Jack Haig and Richie Porte. It would have been his second Olympic participation after also representing Australia in the 2008 points race on the track, an event he holds multiple world titles in but is no longer an Olympic event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AUS Cycling will now reconvene and select a replacement rider for the available spot. Meyer himself congratulated Ben O’Connor on social media for his Tour de France stage win and thanked him for lifting the spirits at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/cameron-meyer-withdraws-from-olympic-games/\">Read More</a>","author":"José Been","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"09dea3d7c92358dffac2af9aa29937ed08a59ece54e592c2f4ea184e2210c179","category":"Cycling"}
