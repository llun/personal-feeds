Typically, customers receive 3% Daily Cash Back for purchases made from Apple. The promotion does not apply to purchases made through the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; Monthly Installment program, carrier financing plans, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> Upgrade Program, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases, or Apple subscriptions such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/\">Apple One</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTo apply for the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, open the Wallet app on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, tap the plus button in the top-right corner, select &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, and follow the on-screen steps. Apple also offers a web-based application form.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe application process takes just a few minutes and, if approved, a virtual ‌&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;‌ will be available for purchases immediately. A physical, titanium &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; can also be requested through the Wallet app for use at retail stores that do not accept contactless payments.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s key features include color-coded spending summaries, no fees, and typically up to 3% cash back on purchases, paid out daily. The card remains limited to the United States, but there have been some hints pointing towards an international expansion in the future.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/apple-card-new-customer-bonus/\">New Apple Card Customers Can Get 6% Daily Cash on Apple Purchases in March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-card-customers-can-get-6-daily-cash-on-apple-purchases-in-march.2286766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VlpzLH9PAC8:0_FWj8TMWmU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VlpzLH9PAC8:0_FWj8TMWmU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VlpzLH9PAC8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f9aaed92b207c4500f254d655968bddbdb53cc6bd1254d239c6c64bd4474fff","category":"Apple"}
