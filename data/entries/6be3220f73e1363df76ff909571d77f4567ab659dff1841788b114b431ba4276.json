Since then, it turns out that Nvidia has quietly and officially unlocked the ability to reduce outside noise when using a microphone on systems with lower-powered GTX-level graphics cards as well.</p>\n<p>A quick hat tip to Tom's Hardware, which <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-voice-works-on-pascal-maxwell-kepler\">recently noticed</a> an <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/nvidia-rtx-voice-setup-guide\">extant version of Nvidia's RTX Voice Setup Guide</a>. It currently notes that \"to use RTX Voice, you must be using <em>an NVIDIA GTX</em> or RTX graphics card, update to Driver 410.18 or newer, and be on Windows 10 [emphasis added].\"</p>\n<p>The addition of GTX cards to the \"requirements\" section of the guide was made around the end of October 2020, according to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201026192446/https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/nvidia-rtx-voice-setup-guide/#Requirements\">a quick perusal of the Internet Archive</a>. About <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200922135749/https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/nvidia-rtx-voice-setup-guide/\">a month before that</a>, Nvidia added an update to the page noting that \"RTX Voice is now enabled for <em>any NVIDIA GeForce</em>, Quadro or TITAN GPU [emphasis added].\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755071#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755071&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6be3220f73e1363df76ff909571d77f4567ab659dff1841788b114b431ba4276","category":"Tech"}
