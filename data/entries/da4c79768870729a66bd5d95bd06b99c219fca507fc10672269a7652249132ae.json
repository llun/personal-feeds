In the Finder, press Command-Shift-period (that’s the “.” or period key). This toggles the hidden-files state, and in any Finder window, you will see any files marked to be invisible as appearing in a grayed-out state. (If you didn’t know this shortcut, you’re not alone: I learned of it just days ago, and in a poll I did on Twitter, most people who responded were unaware of it, too.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Mac users, without looking up why, go the Finder and press Command-Shift-period.

The easiest way is dragging and dropping the item into the Terminal window in the steps below, as that automatically fills in the Unix-style path to the file or folder. Here’s how to hide an item:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Launch <em>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal</em>.</li><li>Enter <code>chflags hidden</code> and type a space after that.</li><li>Drag the item in question into the Terminal window after that space. Alternatively, you can type in the full path, like <code>'/Users/glenn/Documents/Secret Hidden Thing Shhh Shhh/'</code></li><li>Press <em>Return_</em>.</li></ol><p>To reveal that item, just change <code>hidden</code> in step 2 to <code>nohidden</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both hiding and revealing files and folders, the change doesn’t appear immediately in a Finder window that’s display the item you’ve changed. Instead, you need to switch away from the view and return to it, such as going up a layer in the folder hierarchy and back down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Lucy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Launch <em>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal</em>.</li><li>Enter <code>chflags hidden</code> and type a space after that.</li><li>Drag the item in question into the Terminal window after that space.
