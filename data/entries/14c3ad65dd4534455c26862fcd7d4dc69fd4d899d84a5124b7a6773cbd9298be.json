Time&#8217;s design allows for easy shedding of mud or snow and has one of the most secure engagement designs on the market. Last week, SRAM acquired the entire range of road and mountain pedals, cleats, and all related patents of TIME Sport from Rossignol Group. The two companies completed the transaction on February 18, 2021. For Time loyalists, the good news is this means better distribution under the SRAM umbrella and SRAM will keep the Time name going. </p>\n<p>Customers will continue to contact TIME for product service and support during the transition phase through mid-year 2021.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"14c3ad65dd4534455c26862fcd7d4dc69fd4d899d84a5124b7a6773cbd9298be","category":"Cycling"}
