One of the botnet’s malware components was a worm that spread from one vulnerable device to another without requiring any user action. It did this by scanning the Internet for vulnerable devices and, when found, infecting them using a list of exploits that has increased over time.</p>\n<p>The malware also included a cryptominer that uses infected devices to create the Monero digital currency. There was a separate binary file for each component.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755573#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755573&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"13596fc7fdd10e20e693935b3ba94f3730b4bfb46982565bbec50ef3c991844b","category":"Tech"}
