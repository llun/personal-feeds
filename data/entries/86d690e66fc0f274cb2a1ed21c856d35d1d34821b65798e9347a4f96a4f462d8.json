{"title":"Bret Stephens’s Spiked Column Regarding Reporter Donald McNeil’s Ouster From The Times","link":"https://nypost.com/2021/02/11/read-the-column-the-new-york-times-didnt-want-you-read/amp/","date":1613337008000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Last weekend, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens wrote a\npiece criticizing the rationale behind the forced ouster of Times\nreporter Donald G. McNeil Jr., <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/02/11/ny-times-spikes-column-that-criticized-papers-handling-of-n-word-controversy/\">but it was never published</a>.\nStephens told colleagues the column was killed by publisher A.G.\nSulzberger. Since then, the piece has circulated among Times\nstaffers and others — and it was from one of them, not Stephens\nhimself, that The Post obtained it. We publish his spiked column\nhere in full.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bret Stephens:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every serious moral philosophy, every decent legal system and\nevery ethical organization cares deeply about intention.</p>\n\n<p>It is the difference between murder and manslaughter. It is an\naggravating or extenuating factor in judicial settings. It is a\ncardinal consideration in pardons (or at least it was until Donald\nTrump got in on the act). It’s an elementary aspect of parenting,\nfriendship, courtship and marriage.</p>\n\n<p>A hallmark of injustice is indifference to intention. Most of what\nis cruel, intolerant, stupid and misjudged in life stems from that\nindifference. Read accounts about life in repressive societies — I’d recommend Vaclav Havel’s “Power of the Powerless” and Nien\nCheng’s “Life and Death in Shanghai” — and what strikes you first\nis how deeply the regimes care about outward conformity, and how\nlittle for personal intention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that it is rather extraordinary for The Times to spike a column from one of their op-ed page columnists — Times columnists have broad discretion to write what they want.</p>\n\n<p>Stephens’s column is bracing, to be sure, but any discussion of the N-word is inherently bracing. Whatever your thoughts on the McNeil controversy, I don’t see how Stephens’s column about it should not have been published. The column wasn’t bad (I think it’s very good in fact) — but it makes The Times look bad.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Bret Stephens’s Spiked Column Regarding Reporter Donald McNeil’s Ouster From The Times’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/14/stephens-mcneil-column\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"86d690e66fc0f274cb2a1ed21c856d35d1d34821b65798e9347a4f96a4f462d8","category":"Tech"}
