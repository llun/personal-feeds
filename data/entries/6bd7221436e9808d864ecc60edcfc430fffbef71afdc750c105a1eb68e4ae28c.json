He said now his hospital was “completely full and if a patient gets discharged, the bed is filled within minutes”. Ten days ago, the hospital ran out of oxygen, but alternative supplies were found just in time. […]</p>\n\n<p>Thadhani said this time round the virus was “much more aggressive and much more infectious” and was now predominately affecting young people. “Now it is people in their 20s and 30s who are coming in with very severe symptoms and there is a lot of mortality among young people,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>The haunting blare of ambulance sirens continued to ring out across the capital almost non-stop. Inside Lok Nayak government hospital in Delhi, the largest Covid facility in the capital, overburdened facilities and a shortage of oxygen cylinders meant there was two to a bed, while outside patients waiting for beds gasped for air on stretchers and in ambulances, while sobbing relatives stood by their sides. Some sat with oxygen cylinders they had bought themselves out of desperation. Others died waiting in the hospital car park.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/world/india-coronavirus-record.html\">More here from The New York Times</a>. It’s breathtaking how quickly COVID can erupt — India had just 11,000 cases a day in early February. Yesterday they set a record with over 310,000 cases.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/22/india-covid-hell\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6bd7221436e9808d864ecc60edcfc430fffbef71afdc750c105a1eb68e4ae28c","category":"Tech"}
