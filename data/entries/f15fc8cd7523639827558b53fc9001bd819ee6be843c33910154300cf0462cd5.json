{"title":"Every Other Browser Maker to Google: Go FLoC Yourself","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387492/google-floc-ad-tech-privacy-browsers-brave-vivaldi-edge-mozilla-chrome-safari","date":1618608880000,"content":"\n<p>Dieter Bohn, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/16/six-months-no-magsafe-car-charger\">also</a> doing some real work at The Verge today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google is going it alone with its proposed advertising technology\nto replace third-party cookies. Every major browser that uses the\nopen source Chromium project has declined to use it, and it’s\nunclear what that will mean for the future of advertising on the\nweb. […]</p>\n\n<p>One note I’ll drop here is that I am relieved that nobody else\nis implementing FLoC right away, because the way FLoC is\nconstructed puts a very big responsibility on a browser maker.\nIf implemented badly, FLoC could leak out sensitive\ninformation. It’s a complicated technology that does appear to\nkeep you semi-anonymous, but there are enough details to hide\ndozens of devils.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, here’s\n<a href=\"https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/\">Brave</a>: “The worst\naspect of FLoC is that it materially harms user privacy, under the\nguise of being privacy-friendly.” And here’s\n<a href=\"https://vivaldi.com/blog/no-google-vivaldi-users-will-not-get-floced/\">Vivaldi</a>:\n“We will not support the FLoC API and plan to disable it, no\nmatter how it is implemented. It does not protect privacy and it\ncertainly is not beneficial to users, to unwittingly give away\ntheir privacy for the financial gain of Google.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>FLoC is a horrendously bad idea. Google’s goal with FLoC, clearly, is to maintain its surveillance advertising hegemony while <em>further</em> obfuscating the privacy ramifications from today’s status quo. The rest of the industry, led by Apple, is moving toward giving users control over surveillance advertising; FLoC is an attempt to circumvent such control.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/16/browsers-to-google-go-floc-yourself\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f15fc8cd7523639827558b53fc9001bd819ee6be843c33910154300cf0462cd5","category":"Tech"}
