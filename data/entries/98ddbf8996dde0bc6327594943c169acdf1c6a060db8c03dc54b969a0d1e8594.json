With about half the votes counted, 1,100 workers have voted against forming a union, while only 463 voted in favor.</p>\n<p>The National Labor Relations Board is counting the 3,215 votes that were cast by workers at the Bessemer facility. The union needs to win at least half the votes in order to become the official representative of the roughly 6,000 workers at the Bessemer facility. Counting has ended for the evening and is scheduled to resume at 8:30 AM Central Time on Friday.</p>\n<p>The stakes are high for both Amazon and the labor movement. Amazon has more than 1.1 million workers overall, with hundreds of thousands working in fulfillment centers. A successful vote in Bessemer would embolden labor organizers at other Amazon fulfillment centers around the country. An organized workforce could force dramatic changes in the way Amazon manages its warehouses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755663#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755663&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
