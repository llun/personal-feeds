This week we have plenty of news with small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets. I was perhaps most intrigued to learn that Blue Origin has figured out a way to use its New Shepard suborbital launch system to simulate lunar gravity for several minutes. This will help test a lot of tech for Artemis and seems like a shrewd move by Blue.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

Vega is slated to launch on April 20 from the Guiana Space Centre, carrying the 750-kilogram Pl√©iades-Neo 1 Earth-observation satellite.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749067#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749067&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab52e63adc91cc5ee4622540f1e4d85bc7e3b04eaa6177dd7c1fd308c0ee8b7d","category":"Tech"}
