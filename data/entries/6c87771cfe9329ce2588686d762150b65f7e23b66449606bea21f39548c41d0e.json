Additionally, if you're on the hunt for AirPods, there are a few solid sales on the Bluetooth headphones this week.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/33-sale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786640\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

At half off, this is one of the best prices we've seen on this official Apple accessory, and it's available to ship out today.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smart-Folio-10-9-inch-iPad-Air/dp/B08J6B3GHT/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?th=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;40 OFF</div>iPad Air Smart Folio for &#36;39.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you own an iPad Pro, there are also a few Smart Folio discounts, but none as steep as the iPad Air model. You can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smart-Folio-11-inch-iPad-Pro/dp/B0863J6V4N?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1\">11-inch iPad Pro Smart Folio</a> for &#36;64.95 in Black, down from &#36;79.00. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smart-Folio-iPad-12-9-inch/dp/B0863GGLW6/ref=sr_1_5\">12.9-inch model</a> is at &#36;83.88 in Black and Pink Sand, down from &#36;99.00.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Magic Keyboard</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe second sale is a popular ongoing discount on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?ref_=ast_sto_dp\">Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro</a> and fourth generation iPad Air. This accessory is priced at <strong>&#36;199.00</strong> on Amazon, down from &#36;299.00, remaining the best price we've ever seen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Keyboard-11-inch-iPad-Generation/dp/B0863BQJMS?ref_=ast_sto_dp\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;100 OFF</div>11-inch Magic Keyboard for &#36;199.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLikewise, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863F794B\">12.9-inch Magic Keyboard</a> is also still seeing a discounted price, but it's not as good as the smaller version of the accessory. It's available for <strong>&#36;329.00</strong>, down from &#36;349.00. We've seen this accessory marked down to about &#36;315.00 in the past, but today's deal is far more common and one of the best around if you're in the market for the 12.9-inch option of the Magic Keyboard.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>AirPods</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn AirPods sales, Amazon has a few solid offers on the regular AirPods and AirPods with Wireless Charging Case. To start, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\">AirPods with Wired Charging Case</a> for <strong>&#36;119.99</strong>, down from &#36;159.00. The best price we've seen so far in 2021 is about &#36;110 for this model, so Amazon's sale this week isn't too far off and still a decent deal.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;39 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for &#36;119.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you want to invest in the wireless option, Amazon has the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\">AirPods with Wireless Charging Case</a> at <strong>&#36;149.99</strong>, down from &#36;199.99. These aren't discounted as often as the cheaper pair, and although today's price isn't a lowest-ever deal, it's made for one of the first major discounts in 2021 on this model.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macrumors-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1\"target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"fancybutton\"><div class=\"fancybadge\">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wireless Charging Case for &#36;149.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.
