This build goes<span id=\"more-36867\"></span> back a little bit as it&#8217;s a 2019 geometry Routt RSL, so that puts it in the time frame before we changed geometry of the Routt line and the move to GRAVEL WIDE drive trains.

His love of camo patterns started him experimenting and with help of the finish team, they brought the HUNTER finish to life. The team rose to the challenge and we believe they nailed it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Talking to Nick about what he had in mind for his Routt RSL, he said;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>“It’s just such a great all-around bike for most everything I ride on a drop bar bike.” “It’s the perfect mixed surface build.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36856\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004.jpeg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004-88x59.jpeg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0004-1200x800.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Two brands that have stood the test of 40+ years in the business.

Nick has been using their pedals for 5-6 years and loves the adjustable tension feature, as well as the option to use a cleat for more or less float if he wants. Gravel pedals are evolviing and we see more and more going towards a supportive platform like these.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36869 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022.jpeg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022-88x59.jpeg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0022-1200x800.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Stay tuned as spring weather rolls in and more fun builds come to light.
