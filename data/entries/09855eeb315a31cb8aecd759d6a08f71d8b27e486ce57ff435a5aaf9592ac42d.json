He‚Äôs headlined multiple campaigns for Specialized, and attracted endorsement deals for everything from big sunglasses (<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/04/new-for-peter-sagans-face-100s-hypercraft-sunglasses-with-carbon-weave/\">‚ÄúI can see everything I need to!‚Äù</a>) to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcyElUBIW8Q\">Jerusalem artichoke extract</a> (Never Forget).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a marketing perspective, Peter Sagan has been the most attractive athlete in the sport for a number of years. In 2020, according to <a href=\"https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/peter-sagan-tops-pro-cycling-highest-earners-list/\">Cyclingnews</a>, he was cycling&#8217;s top earner with an income of around ‚Ç¨5.5 million (US$6.55 million)&nbsp;‚Äì an amount that incorporates his salary from Bora-Hansgrohe as well as personal endorsement deals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized, for example, is widely assumed to have a personal deal with the Slovak star ‚Äì&nbsp;although the brand declined to comment on questions from CyclingTips, citing athlete confidentiality ‚Äì while 100% sunglasses are almost synonymous with Sagan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sagan&#8217;s social media presence ‚Äì&nbsp;which includes over 1.8 million followers on Instagram ‚Äì&nbsp;can put a brand&#8217;s products in front of a whole lot of eyeballs. A single <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PeterSagan/videos/10156310387599467/\">viral Peter Sagan Moment</a> in 2018 was estimated by one sports marketing firm to have generated over US$330,000 of value for his sponsors, as <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/04/peter-sagans-330000-facebook-post-and-the-value-of-cyclists-social-media/\">CyclingTips reported</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you multiply that out over all of the Peter Sagan Moments in a season, it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s money to be made. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, expensive bikes and enormous sunglasses are one thing, and advertising these to cyclists is preaching to the choir. But it&#8217;s the non-endemic brands that align with Sagan that I, dear reader, find vastly more interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1168\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oss_sagan-peter_bora_1899fr-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-503291\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oss_sagan-peter_bora_1899fr-2.jpeg 1168w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oss_sagan-peter_bora_1899fr-2-650x278.jpeg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oss_sagan-peter_bora_1899fr-2-190x81.jpeg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oss_sagan-peter_bora_1899fr-2-1080x462.jpeg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/oss_sagan-peter_bora_1899fr-2-16x7.jpeg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px\" /><figcaption>Peter Sagan shows Daniel Oss his sweet potato.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The German homeware brands that sponsor Sagan&#8217;s Bora-Hansgrohe team have been particularly creative in capitalising on the Slovakian&#8217;s fame. In the process, they&#8217;ve unleashed some of the most arresting brand synergies since <a href=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2011_Boonen_pillow.jpg\">Tom Boonen had a pillow</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bora ‚Äì&nbsp;a cookware specialist ‚Äì&nbsp;has been involved in cycling since 2015, and yesterday released its latest colourful Peter Sagan-starring advertisement for a campaign titled ‚ÄúNot Only For Rockstars‚Äù. (Peter Sagan is, for whatever it‚Äôs worth, not <em>even</em> a rockstar ‚Äì that Grease clip aside. But sure.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this one-minute spot, Sagan wears headphones and a leather jacket, shreds a town bike down a hill in Monaco to a guitar store, buys a banjolele and butchers John Denver. It is Peak Sagan, following all the familiar beats of his past work: bad boy image &gt; stunt-riding &gt; WTF moment &gt; fade to black. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"BORA - Not only for rockstars\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcZqEhamlbk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It‚Äôs not immediately clear what it <em>is</em> that Bora&#8217;s trying to sell ‚Äì&nbsp;I thought it was a waffle iron; it‚Äôs actually a futuristic extractor fan ‚Äì&nbsp;but regardless, Bora delivers on the promise of a bit of bicycle-adjacent weirdness that gets the people going.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bora isn&#8217;t the only German homeware brand to have put Sagan&#8217;s celebrity to use. Hansgrohe, the luxury sanitary fittings company that has co-sponsored his team since 2017, knows that star power sells showers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hansgrohe&#8217;s marketing nous is vast and varied. The company knows its way around a hashtag ‚Äì&nbsp;like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9BISHFOFXQ\">Zoolander-esque</a> #MeetTheBeautyOfWater ‚Äì&nbsp;but the real high water mark of its sponsorship was arguably a <a href=\"https://www.petersagan.com/product/petersagan-hand-shower/\">Peter Sagan-branded handshower</a> (limited release, now out of stock üò¢). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2019 ‚Äò<a href=\"https://www.hansgrohe-group.com/en/pressrelease/hansgrohe_tour-de-france_en_2019-07-04\">Shower Like a Pro</a>‚Äô campaign had its own peculiar charms; the less said about 2018&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwidvcyA_Y\">&#8216;A daily dose of energy&#8217;</a> the better, although at least there&#8217;s some symmetry in that it&#8217;s a shower ad that makes you feel like you need a shower after watching it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwidvcyA_Y\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"705\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm-1340x705.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-501633\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm-1340x705.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm-650x342.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm-190x100.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm-1080x568.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm-16x8.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-1.29.09-pm.jpg 1909w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></a><figcaption>Want to watch a selection of supple cyclists have showers in slow motion? Click on that picture, I dare you. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, despite Sagan‚Äôs relative lack of results being a bit of a cold shower, the Slovak and his teammate Emanuel Buchmann were called on to help showcase Hansgrohe&#8217;s PowderRain feature in a campaign which included the following amazing press release quote:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong><em>Showering is relaxing, showering is refreshing. This we all know. But hansgrohe wants to take it a step further. </em></strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This seamlessly segued into a steamy photoset of cyclists enjoying their #MyRelaxingMoment, along with quotes that certainly never happened:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery__slider\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1172\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"501628\" class=\"wp-image-501628\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am.png 1172w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am-650x405.png 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am-190x118.png 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am-400x250.png 400w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am-1080x673.png 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.37-am-16x10.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">Fact check: false.</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1169\" height=\"704\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"501682\" data-full-url=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1.png\" data-link=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?attachment_id=501682\" class=\"wp-image-501682\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1.png 1169w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1-650x391.png 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1-190x114.png 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1-1080x650.png 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.47.54-am-1-16x10.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1169px) 100vw, 1169px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">I do not for a second think that Emanuel Buchmann believes any such thing.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how silly it absolutely all is, the fact that Bora and Hansgrohe have seen fit to spend millions of euro on sponsoring a cycling team ‚Äì&nbsp;and let Peter Sagan fly his freak flag in the process ‚Äì&nbsp;is worth a moment&#8217;s pause. Sponsorship is not philanthropy; at this scale, it needs to make a sound financial argument. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the exact return is necessarily opaque, there are some hefty clues to how lucrative Peter Sagan is for the brands that align with him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In late 2020, Will Bruckbauer, founder and CEO of Bora, announced a lengthy sponsorship extension which will see the cookware company in the sport until at least 2024. &#8220;For Bora, the sponsorship was quite the windfall from the very beginning,‚Äù he said. &#8220;We have been conducting regular monitoring since 2015 and have clearly noticed that brand awareness has multiplied, that we are growing much faster and stronger in markets with a connection to cycling, and that the group of people interested in cycling in particular has a much clearer picture of Bora and our products.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to Hansgrohe, who will be handing out teal boardshorts and creeping on showering cyclists for another four seasons. The company&#8217;s CEO described it as an &#8220;incredibly successful partnership&#8221; (the team sponsorship, not the showering cyclists + teal boardshorts), saying that &#8220;the positive effects on our brand and our consistently pleasant cooperation with the team to this day are factors that have undoubtedly confirmed our decision.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1168\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hansgrohe_shower_peter_sagan_249.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-503312\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hansgrohe_shower_peter_sagan_249.jpeg 1168w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hansgrohe_shower_peter_sagan_249-650x278.jpeg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hansgrohe_shower_peter_sagan_249-190x81.jpeg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hansgrohe_shower_peter_sagan_249-1080x462.jpeg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hansgrohe_shower_peter_sagan_249-16x7.jpeg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px\" /><figcaption>Sagan battles a showerhead in an abandoned factory. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Sagan&#8217;s sporting dominance may not be what it was, and younger competitors with similar strengths have risen, the enigmatic Slovak remains the sport&#8217;s most marketable figure. And if a company hitching its fancy cooktop extractor to his wagon makes a sound financial argument, then it&#8217;s a win for cycling.
