{"title":"Apple's New Pride Bands Include App Clip on Packaging for Quick Access to Matching Watch Face","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/apple-watch-pride-band-app-clip/","date":1621270401000,"content":"Apple today released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/pride-edition-braided-solo-nike-sport-loop/\">new Pride Edition versions of the Braided Solo Loop and Nike Sport Loop</a> for the Apple Watch, while a matching Pride Woven watch face will be available in a future software update (likely <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/apple-seeds-watchos-7-5-beta-3-to-developers/\">watchOS 7.5</a>, which is currently in beta).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/pride-band-app-clip.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOne interesting tidbit shared in the announcement is that, for the first time, Apple will be including a scannable App Clip code on the packaging of each new Pride band, providing a convenient way for customers to immediately access the new Pride Woven watch face when available. (App Clip codes require an iPhone running iOS 14.3 or later.)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntroduced in iOS 14, an App Clip is a small part of an app that's discoverable at the moment it's needed, even if the app is not installed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $99, the Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop weaves together the original rainbow colors with those drawn from various Pride flags, according to Apple. Or, for $49, the Pride Edition Nike Sport Loop features a nylon weave with reflective rainbow yarn inspired by the Pride flag, which Apple says is designed to shimmer when light strikes it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop is compatible with the Apple Watch Series 4 or later, while the Pride Edition Nike Sport Loop is compatible with Apple Watch Series 3 or later. The new Pride bands are <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/search/pride?src=globalnav\">available to order today from Apple.com</a> and the Apple Store app, and will be available at Apple Store locations beginning May 25.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/\">Apple Watch bands</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pride/\">Pride</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/apple-watch-pride-band-app-clip/\">Apple's New Pride Bands Include App Clip on Packaging for Quick Access to Matching Watch Face</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-pride-bands-include-app-clip-on-packaging-for-quick-access-to-matching-watch-face.2296516/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CHwCKgeNpH0:cTOaT0AJVZ8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CHwCKgeNpH0:cTOaT0AJVZ8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CHwCKgeNpH0\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01d118127c634289eb0d60aec4bf07c011e1a8c802bcba5e1d70c56882c96267","category":"Apple"}
