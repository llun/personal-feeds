The ability to use several motors—together with sophisticated software—means greater design flexibility, opening the door to new types of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft that straddle the line between conventional airplane and helicopter.</p>\n<p>This technology got overhyped in the late 2010s. Uber, for example, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/uber-targets-2020-for-on-demand-vtol-demo-flights-in-dallas-and-dubai/\">announced</a> in 2017 that it was aiming to launch a VTOL taxi service in Dallas and Dubai in 2020. Instead, Uber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/\">sold off</a> its air taxi efforts to startup Joby in December 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741127#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741127&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
