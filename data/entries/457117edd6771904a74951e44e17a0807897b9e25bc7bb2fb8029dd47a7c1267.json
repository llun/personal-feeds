{"title":"Snap Working on Advanced Smart Glasses With Augmented Reality Capabilities","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/snap-augmented-reality-smart-glasses/","date":1617139993000,"content":"Snap is designing a new set of \"Spectacles\" smart glasses that have augmented reality capabilities, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/snap-plans-hardware-push-with-ar-spectacles-drone\">The Information</a></em>. Snap has sold several versions of its <a href=\"https://www.spectacles.com\">Spectacles</a>, but current options do not have AR features and are instead equipped with a camera for uploading content to social network Snapchat.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/snap-spectacles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1786\" height=\"1005\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-791566\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe augmented reality Spectacles will be aimed at developers and creators rather than the consumer market. Developers and creators design the AR effects on the Snapchat app, and <em>The Information</em> suggests that Snap is hoping developers will use the Spectacles to build out new software experiences for the glasses, with the aim of later providing the AR glasses to all users.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe glasses, which are the first to include displays, will be able to superimpose existing Snapchat lenses on the real world, allowing people to see Snapchat filters on actual objects and people. There will be two cameras capable of recording videos, similar to the current version, with that video then able to be shared on Snapchat.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSnap is planning to unveil the Spectacles at its annual developer conference that will be held in May, and the AR glasses come amid rumors that Apple is working on its own version of smart glasses with AR capabilities.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has an AR/VR headset in the works that could come out as early as 2022, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">the smart glasses</a> that focus on augmented reality are not expected until at least 2023.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snapchat/\">Snapchat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snap/\">Snap</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/snap-augmented-reality-smart-glasses/\">Snap Working on Advanced Smart Glasses With Augmented Reality Capabilities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/snap-working-on-advanced-smart-glasses-with-augmented-reality-capabilities.2290137/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=T158Ia9GMuY:WFcWQkW_Bg8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=T158Ia9GMuY:WFcWQkW_Bg8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/T158Ia9GMuY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"457117edd6771904a74951e44e17a0807897b9e25bc7bb2fb8029dd47a7c1267","category":"Apple"}
