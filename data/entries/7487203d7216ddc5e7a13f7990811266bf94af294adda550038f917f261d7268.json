Abbott won the overall that year, and the following season Winder signed for UnitedHealthcare, a top American team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016 Winder went to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games for the team pursuit, and after the games joined UnitedHealthcare once again to race on the road in 2017.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During her 2017 season, Winder was picked up by Team Sunweb to move to Europe for the following season. In 2019 she joined Trek-Segafredo and has been riding for the powerhouse team ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her most notable results include the overall general classification title at the Santos Women’s Tour Down Under in 2020, the 2019 National Road title, a stage of the Giro Donne in 2018, Brabantse Pijl in 2021, and various other accomplishments and podiums throughout her run in the professional peloton. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CRGTeZWDM5L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CRGTeZWDM5L/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Trek-Segafredo (@treksegafredo)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/ruth-winder-announces-her-retirement/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"7487203d7216ddc5e7a13f7990811266bf94af294adda550038f917f261d7268","category":"Cycling"}
