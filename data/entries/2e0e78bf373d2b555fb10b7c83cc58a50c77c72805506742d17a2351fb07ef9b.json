This film wouldn’t have been possible without the people who were willing the share their time and stories.

Covid-19 has impacted small towns and indigenous communities at disproportionate rates, so please don’t travel to do this ride – or any rides outside of your locales – until the pandemic subsides. This will give you plenty of time to plan for an epic and safe ride along the Camino del Diablo…</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36759\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DJI_0051.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36762\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/16-DSC06701.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-36760\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DJI_0045.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36768\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP.jpg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP-300x169.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP-768x432.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP-88x50.jpg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/SHARED-TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS-MAP-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moots.com/shared-territory-borderlands/\">SHARED TERRITORY-BORDERLANDS</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots</a>.</p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"2e0e78bf373d2b555fb10b7c83cc58a50c77c72805506742d17a2351fb07ef9b","category":"Cycling"}
