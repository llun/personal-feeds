Now, an interdisciplinary team at University College London (UCL) has come up with a computational model that reveals a dazzling display of the ancient Greek cosmos, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84310-w\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports. The team is currently building a replica mechanism, moving gears and all, using modern machinery.
