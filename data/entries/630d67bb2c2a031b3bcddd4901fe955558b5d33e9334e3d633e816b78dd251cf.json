The new device does have LTE connectivity, which requires a monthly subscription of either $5.99 (with an annual contract) or $6.99 (with no annual contract), but the feature is exclusively for enhanced safety tracking and activity sharing.</p>\n<p>These enhanced functions enable you to receive audio and text messages from chosen contacts via a shared link during activities, as well as two-way text communication with Garmin’s 24/7 emergency services, in case of an event. But beyond that, you cannot send or receive calls or texts without your phone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769155#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769155&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"630d67bb2c2a031b3bcddd4901fe955558b5d33e9334e3d633e816b78dd251cf","category":"Tech"}
