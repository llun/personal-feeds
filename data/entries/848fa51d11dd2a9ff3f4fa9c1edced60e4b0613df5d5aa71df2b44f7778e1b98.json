The final throes of the stage will be contested up the steep gradients of the hill’s final two kilometres.</p>\n<p>La Course by Le Tour de France, the women’s one-day race, will tackle the same route, with Great Britain’s Lizzie Deignan the defending champion.</p>\n<p>A sprint finish is expected in Pontivy on stage three, before the race ends its stay in Brittany with another bunch gallop anticipated in Fougères.</p>\n<h2>Early time trial then into the Alps</h2>\n<p>The 27km time trial on stage five, from Changé to Laval, should shake up the general classification – the longest time trial in the Tour’s first week since 2008.</p>\n<p>Wind could be a factor on stage six, as the peloton races from Tours to Châteauroux, where Mark Cavendish won his first-ever Tour stage in 2008.</p>\n<p>A monster 249km stage then features on stage seven – the longest at the Tour de France since 2000. The short but punishing climb of the Signal d’Uchon will test weary legs at the 230km mark, with a maximum slope of 18 per cent.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Tour heads into Alps at the end of the first week. Stage eight tackles the Côte de Mont-Saxonnex (5.7km at 8.3 per cent), Col de Romme (8.8km at 8.9 per cent) and Col de la Colombière (7.5km at 8.5 per cent) before a finish in Le Grand-Bornand.</p>\n<p>The race’s first summit finish is on stage nine at Tignes after a 21km climb with a 5.6 per cent average gradient, before the first rest day.</p>\n<h2>Double dose of Ventoux</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mont Ventoux returns to the Tour de France for the first time since 2016, when Chris Froome was forced to run up part of the climb.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>A sprint in the Rhone Valley opens the second week, but the most anticipated stage of the race features the following day.</p>\n<p>Mont Ventoux is on the route for the first time since Chris Froome was forced to run up the iconic mountain following a crash in 2016.</p>\n<p>Stage 11 tackles the Giant of Provence first from Sault (22km at 5.1 per cent) before the classic route from Bedoin (15.7km at 8.8 per cent), en-route to a finish in Malaucène.</p>\n<p>Stage finishes follow in Nîmes and Carcassonne, before the race heads into the Pyrenees.</p>\n<h2>Andorra and summit finishes in the Pyrenees</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tadej Pogačar seized 2020 Tour de France victory from Primož Roglič on the penultimate stage time trial.
