They puzzled over the phenomenon and wondered whether it was a sign the star was about to go supernova. Several months later, they had narrowed the most likely explanations to two: a short-lived cold patch on the star's southern surface (akin to a sun spot), or a clump of dust making the star seem dimmer to observers on Earth. We now have our answer, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03546-8)%20(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03546-8\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Nature. Dust is the <a href=\"https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2109/\">primary culprit</a>, but it is linked to the brief emergence of a cold spot.</p>\n<p>As Ars' John Timmer <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/astronomers-kill-all-the-fun-blame-dust-for-betelgeuses-dimming/\">reported last year</a>, Betelgeuse is one of the closest massive stars to Earth, about 700 light years away. It's an old star that has reached the stage where it glows a dull red and expands, with the hot core only having a tenuous gravitational grip on its outer layers. The star has something akin to a heartbeat, albeit an extremely slow and irregular one. Over time, the star cycles through periods when its surface expands and then contracts.</p>\n<p>One of these cycles is fairly regular, taking a bit over five years to complete. Layered on that is a shorter, more irregular cycle that takes anywhere from under a year to 1.5 years to complete. While they're easy to track with ground-based telescopes, these shifts don't cause the sort of radical changes in the star's light that would account for the changes seen during the dimming event. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773745#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773745&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3593df09c5b87eef13f811f970941e9d97fcafd5000860d09bfe1ed7de633d3b","category":"Tech"}
