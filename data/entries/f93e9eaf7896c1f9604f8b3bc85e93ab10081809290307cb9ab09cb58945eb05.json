Once that's done, it's just a simple matter of selecting it as your audio output destination on your iOS or Mac device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith ‌AirPlay‌ 2, you can use your newly connected speakers as part of a multi-room setup incorporating other speakers like HomePods, with audio output being synced across all speakers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntegration with the Home app also gives you the ability to incorporate your speakers into scenes and other automations.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://belkin.evyy.net/Zdr5Rk\">Soundform Connect Audio Adapter with AirPlay 2</a> is priced at $99.99, so it's not exactly cheap, but if you got a nice sound system that lacks ‌AirPlay‌ support, this adapter can add some very useful functionality.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay-2/\">AirPlay 2</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/25/hands-on-belkin-soundform-connect-airplay-2/\">Video: Belkin's Soundform Connect Adds AirPlay 2 to Your Existing Speakers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-belkins-soundform-connect-adds-airplay-2-to-your-existing-speakers.2302288/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QuPi1eKCoic:50sW1fbAPfc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QuPi1eKCoic:50sW1fbAPfc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QuPi1eKCoic\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f93e9eaf7896c1f9604f8b3bc85e93ab10081809290307cb9ab09cb58945eb05","category":"Apple"}
