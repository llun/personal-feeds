Uttrup Ludwig led a reduced peloton across the line after an aggressive day of racing. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM) and Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx) took second and third on the stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niamh Fisher-Black (SD Worx) took the leaders jersey from Chabbey and sits tied on time with Grace Brown (Team BikeExchange) going into the final stage of the race on Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A flurry of attacks was thwarted as the race approached the final climb to the finish. Canyon-SRAM’s Omer Shapira worked hard to make sure the race stuck together until 5.7 km to go when the race leader Elise Chabbey (Canyon-SRAM) launched an attack. Chabbey was followed by Karol-Ann Canuel of SD Worx. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two gained a slight advantage, with 2 km to go they had gained an eight-second advantage on the peloton. With 1.2 km to go the peloton led by Team BikeExchange closed in on Chabbey and Canuel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niewiadoma opened up the sprint to the line but Uttrup Ludwig overtook the Polish rider in the final meters to take stage honours. </p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Vuelta a Burgos Feminas (2.WWT)\n                                                    <span>Medina de Pomar → Ojo Guareña</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255936\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">LUDWIG Cecilie Uttrup</a>\n                                            <span>FDJ Nouvelle Aquitaine Futuroscope</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">NIEWIADOMA Katarzyna</a>\n                                            <span>Canyon SRAM Racing</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">VAN DER BREGGEN Anna</a>\n                                            <span>SD Worx</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                                        </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                    <a href=\"/race-result?race=255936\">Full results →</a>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n            </div>\n    \n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/cecilie-uttrup-ludwig-wins-vuelta-a-burgos-feminas-stage-3/\">Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig wins Vuelta a Burgos Feminas stage 3</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8a029c28a8f06428ef0f1d297860b7974866aec4a3b8c4f5c168916e6781d2df","category":"Cycling"}
