The new open source standard will rely on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, and Thread for device setup and connectivity.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a webinar hosted by the Zigbee Alliance earlier this week, highlighted by <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387252/project-chip-will-finally-ship-later-this-year\">The Verge</a></em>, companies participating in the project will be able to get devices certified beginning in late 2021. The standard will be available across several categories, including lights, locks, cameras, thermostats, window coverings/shades, TVs, and even smart home bridges to bring Project CHIP to older smart home products.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the Project CHIP standard is successful, customers will have greater confidence that smart home products they purchase are compatible with a wide variety of smart home platforms and smart home products they already own.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/project-chip-certification-late-2021/\">Apple-Backed 'Project CHIP' to Start Smart Home Device Certification in Late 2021</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-backed-project-chip-to-start-smart-home-device-certification-in-late-2021.2291922/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qwz72_DS0PA:c3N1l60_m9I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Qwz72_DS0PA:c3N1l60_m9I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Qwz72_DS0PA\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1ddef60380d33b4aac1cf8ea84140955502d93841ccafe1c78549d7e9a2da8da","category":"Apple"}
