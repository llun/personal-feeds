Paul\nKafasis of <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/\">Rogue Amoeba</a> told me via IM, “70%? That’s…\nthat’s… livable,” which seems to sum up the consensus sentiment. […]</p>\n\n<p>In short, what developers lose per-transaction from Apple’s 30\npercent take, they can more than make up for in volume. This is\ngoing to be a gold rush.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was correct that native apps on iPhone were going to be a huge thing, but I did not foresee how “free” apps would cripple/stunt/distort the market for selling them. The market for selling iOS apps never resembled the market for selling Mac apps pre-iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>Calling it a “gold rush” was, arguably, more right than I knew. At the time I wrote that, I meant it in the common sense of a new market where many would have the opportunity to make a fortune. But in a real-life gold rush, do <em>that</em> many people make a fortune? It certainly wasn’t the boon to indie Mac developers that I predicted.</p>\n\n<p>(Rogue Amoeba, for example, has <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/satellite/ios/\">a free iOS companion app for Airfoil</a>, and in 2008 released <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=MiscRetiredApps\">Radioshift Touch for iPhone</a> for the sky-high price of $10, but as a business, they are every bit as much a Mac developer today as they were in 2008.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘From the DF Archive: ‘iPhone Enterprise and SDK: First Impressions and Questions’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/09/df-archive-iphone-sdk\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"11c6558071fa5636051a6e5dc1851d3a2890c0081b10cdce701974aa6bb33898","category":"Tech"}
