We’re getting a lot of messages asking when we’re restocking short sleeve shirts, bottles, and other items. Well, two weeks ago we <a href=\"https://shop.theradavist.com/collections/all-products\" target=\"_blank\">re-upped some of our classic</a> bottles, Desert hats, Dynaplugs, and more but we didn’t make an announcement. Next week, we’re dropping three shirts, new decals, bottles, and more as part of our <em>Spring.Summer</em> drop. With delays in manufacturing, we’ll be trickling out more over the course of the summer but the big restock is coming next week, so stay tuned.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"eae5d32f35e146f5de34d7db30cc3c3f5f6de63cb408a2eec40eb1613bfa7b3d","category":"Cycling"}
