In particular, because half of my gear that I was using in Central Asia was stranded in Nepal on lockdown, I’d have to try to piece together a rig using older equipment I had lying around as well as a handful of new additions to round it out.</p>\n<p>To start, I picked up a Surly Bridge Club.  I originally had intended only to have it as a do-it-all bike while I was home, but when I found out I was heading to Turkey, I was intrigued to see how an off-the-shelf $1150 bike with entry-level components would fare compared to higher-end setups like my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2016/08/44-bikes-27-5-rigid-mtb-ryan-wilson/\">44 Bikes Marauder</a> and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/11/ryan-wilsons-rig-in-review-8-months-in-asia-on-the-tumbleweed-prospector/\">Tumbleweed Prospector</a>. I’ll post my full thoughts on the Bridge Club soon, but in the meantime, here is my full kit list along with six pieces of gear that stood out in the Taurus Mountains.<span></span></p>\n<p><img

 The following are a few new-to-me pieces of gear that stood out during my time in Turkey.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-02.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo Tent </b>– Not only does this 1.5 person tent tip the scales at a scant 800 grams or so, but it’s also the most packable tent I’ve ever used. This was the main draw of the <a href=\"https://www.sixmoondesigns.com/products/lunar-solo\" target=\"_blank\">Lunar Solo</a> for me. Easily stuff-able in my 4L Apidura fork pack with room to spare, it disappears in your bags compared to other tents with this kind of living space. Yes, the single-wall construction does force you to be mindful of avoiding the dreaded touch of condensation in the mornings, but this is the case with any single-wall tent.  For very wet environments, you may want to stick with a double-wall, but if you’re tight on space, the Lunar Solo is hard to beat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-06.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Tumbleweed T-Rack – </b>While it can be nice to go rack-less and save a few grams, I like the extra flexibility that having a lightweight rack provides. Whenever the weather is agreeable I prefer to ditch the shoes and ride in Bedrock Sandals, but it’s always tricky to find a place to store bulky shoes. The <a href=\"https://www.tumbleweed.cc/store/t-rack\" target=\"_blank\">T-Rack</a> and a large Voile strap solve that issue. Need a little more water capacity? Put those shoes on your feet and stash a durable water bladder on top! 3-bolt mounts give plenty of options for mounting cargo or additional water.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-07.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-08.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Apidura Expedition Fork Packs</b> – Conveniently sized to perfectly fit my Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo tent (plus a small wind jacket or gloves) in one and my 4” thick Sea to Summit Etherlight insulated sleeping pad in the other, these were super solid. Water-tight, and easy to mount to my King Cage Anything Cages with no additional hardware. One big reason I decided to run these <a href=\"https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-fork-pack-4-5l/\" target=\"_blank\">Fork Packs</a> for this trip is that I wanted a derailleur-saver on the rear of the bike in the event that it toppled over at some point. I’ve still got trauma from my days in South America with that derailleur so exposed all the time. These bags took a couple of tough blows for the team and kept on going.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Ombraz Sunglasses</b> – Yeah, I’m on the <a href=\"https://ombraz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ombraz</a> hype train. As a licensed and board-certified Frequent Glasses Breaker™, I am happy to announce that these lasted an entire tour and I didn’t snap a single-arm (probably because there are none)! I find them to be super comfortable, and love that they lay flat on my chest under a jacket when the weather takes a turn. It’s pretty tough to put them on while riding, but stopping for a second is a small price to pay.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-04.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-05.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Vittoria Mezcal TNT G2.0 Tires</b> – At 27.5 x 2.6”, these are a touch smaller than the 3” Maxxis Chronicles I’m used to riding. However, the terrain in Turkey would be a bit more mixed than what I’m used to in places like Bolivia or Tajikistan, so I found them well suited for the route.  The WTB Nano-esque tread profile of these Mezcals, with the nearly-continuous center tread was probably the fastest tire I’ve used around this size, providing a nice break from the overpowering road buzz of the Chronicles. Plus, while I do try to be careful when riding in remote regions where quality tires are difficult to source, I had no durability issues with these on even the roughest tracks in the Taurus Mountains.  In fact, I’d be confident to take them anywhere I’ve ridden over the last 5 years.  If only Vittoria would get them back in stock!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/RyanWilson_GearListTurkey-09.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><b>Klean Kanteen TKWide Insulated 64oz (1.9L)</b> <b>Bottle</b>– I know what you’re gonna say… ”Damn, Ryan, 836 grams is a lot for a water bottle!”, but hear me out. When it’s a thousand degrees outside and you’ve been riding all day under the scorching Mediterranean sun, busting out a huge bottle of cold water while your other bottles have turned to molten lava is pretty clutch. I wouldn’t bring this everywhere, but in Turkey, it was worth it. I try to rationalize that on previous tours I would have used two bottles to equal this much capacity. Am I out of my mind? You be the judge.</p>\n<p>Questions, comments, or suggestions?  Let me know in the comments.</p>","author":"Ryan Wilson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"1a8044fa76943dd83f3abb6a327c9a232c5c76e80cdb5df0a683a8e2e850680a","category":"Cycling"}
