I have a 3T Exploro RaceMax Boost in for testing and my complete 56cm bike weighs in at just 12.5kg with 35mm gravel tyres and a build designed to handle off-road knocks and terrain.</p>\n<p>Control of the motor system is simple, with colour-coded lights on the control button denoting both power level and battery reserves. Press the top tube-mounted iWOC button to turn it on and the ring LED shines white, press and hold and it turns green for low assistance, orange for medium, and red for full assistance.</p>\n<p>This is also the battery level indicator: white is 75 to 100 per cent battery remaining, green 75 to 50 per cent, orange 50 to 25 per cent, red less than 25 per cent, and flashing red less than 10 per cent.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ebikemotion’s iWoc controller is flush-mounted into the top tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The slim integrated 250Wh battery sits inside the down tube and while the battery is removable, it’s only really recommended that you do so for servicing purposes because it involves removal of the bottom bracket, too.</p>\n<p>Unlike most of its rivals, which mount the charge port in the cradle between down and seat tube just above the bottom bracket, 3T has chosen to mount the charge port facing forwards on the underside of the bottom bracket.</p>\n<p>This all adds up to one of the stealthiest looking ebikes around, with no obvious port on the bottom bracket and the flush-fitting iWoc controller that’s only really noticeable if you know where to look.</p>\n<p>However, despite 3T’s waterproof claims, I do have reservations about a forward-facing ebike charger connection, given the UK’s inclement weather. I haven’t had a chance to try it yet, but with a couple of gravel routes planned with ford crossings, it’s sure to get a good testing.</p>\n<h2>3T Exploro RaceMax Boost geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Flat-bar gravel, surely that’s all about ride to work fun?</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<p>3T’s Exploro RaceMax Boost is available in sizes from XXS up to a huge 61cm and the geometry is the same as the super-sporty, non-e-assisted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/3t-exploro-racemax-review/\">RaceMax</a>, which is impressive given the inclusion of an ebike drivetrain.</p>\n<p>While the bike is compatible with both 650b and 700c wheel sizes, having that choice to swap kind of goes out of the window on an e-gravel bike that features a rear hub-based motor – you’re likely to stick with what’s specced.</p>\n<p>Of course, if your pockets are deep enough you <em>could</em> get both a 700c and 650b X35 rear-hub wheel, but that’s going to be a serious extra outlay of cash. If the bike does well, though, it’s very likely we’ll see a 2× road/gravel version and a big tyred 650b bike.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿</th><th>XXS</th><th>51</th><th>54</th><th>56</th><th>58</th><th>61</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seat angle (degrees)</td><td>74.5</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td><td>73</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head angle (degrees)</td><td>69</td><td>69.5</td><td>71</td><td>72</td><td>72</td><td>72</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay (cm)</td><td>41.5</td><td>41.5</td><td>41.5</td><td>41.5</td><td>41.5</td><td>41.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube (cm)</td><td>43.6</td><td>46.3</td><td>49</td><td>51.8</td><td>54.5</td><td>57.2</td>        </tr><tr><td>Top tube (cm)</td><td>50.6</td><td>52.6</td><td>54.6</td><td>56.6</td><td>58.6</td><td>60.6</td>        </tr><tr><td>Bottom bracket drop (cm)</td><td>7.9</td><td>7.9</td><td>7.7</td><td>7.7</td><td>7.5</td><td>7.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>998</td><td>1,008</td><td>1,008</td><td>1,014</td><td>1,024</td><td>1,044</td>        </tr><tr><td>Stack (cm)</td><td>52</td><td>54.2</td><td>56.4</td><td>58.4</td><td>60.4</td><td>63.2</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (cm)</td><td>35.5</td><td>36.6</td><td>37.7</td><td>38.5</td><td>39.3</td><td>40.4</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Ultralight 3T Exploro Racemax Boost</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Can you tell it’s an ebike yet?</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<p>3T’s design guru, Gerard Vroomen, was at the forefront of Cervélo’s superlight road bike designs and his own Open brand makes some astonishingly light mountain and gravel designs, so it’s perhaps not that surprising that the Exploro RaceMax Boost is also available in a very limited and lighter weight offering.</p>\n<p>The Exploro Racemax Boost Ultralight build comprises parts from Carbon-Ti, 3T, THM and more to create a gravel bike that weighs just 10.89kg with proper 38mm Panaracer Gravel tyres.</p>\n<p>Remember, that’s with a full ebike system and 250Wh battery – the ebikemotion system alone weighs in excess of 3kg.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A claimed 10.89kg for a fat-tyred gravel bike is pretty decent, especially with a motor and battery fitted.</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<p>At £10,299 / $9,999/ €10,199, 3T’s RaceMax Boost Ultralight doesn’t come cheap, but it just goes to show that e-assistance doesn’t have to mean e-hindrance, and is an indication of what the future could hold for e-road and e-gravel bikes.</p>\n<h2>3T Exploro RaceMax Boost first ride impressions</h2>\n<p>The Exploro RaceMax Boost feels every inch as good as the brilliant non-e-assisted RaceMax with one simple difference; when the dirt road heads upwards I can add a bit of extra boost for extra traction, to keep me pedalling up trails I have no right to be pedalling on.</p>\n<p>That means with the 1× GRX 40/42 gear combo, 20 per cent plus gradients on surfaces that a 35mm tyre has no business keeping grip on are doable.</p>\n<p>I have to admit to being a big fan of e-gravel for the simple reason that it overcomes the limitations of slender (by mountain bike standards) levels of grip. The welcome 250W e-assistance means you can remain seated on steep inclines and the rear tyre holds grip whereas on a standard (non-ebike) gravel bike you’d need to stand and risk losing rear wheel traction.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s 1× GRX handles drivetrain duties.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is a rapid bike. It’s easy to hold pace on the road beyond the top assistance speed of 25kph (the legal limit in the UK), which maximises the bike’s range with the motor only kicking in when you need true assistance on steep road climbs or steep, loose gravel ascents.</p>\n<p>So far, it has handled superbly on the limited amount of testing I’ve undertaken and the geometry feels so sorted both on-road and off. The 3T bar and Selle Italia saddle are proving comfortable too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 3T’s new super-wide gravel rims are shod with Pirelli’s excellent Cinturato gravel tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When it comes to performance drop-bar ebikes, the 3T Exploro RaceMax Boost is proving to be one of the best around and has been putting a massive smile on my face all day – but it’s not a cheap ride.</p>\n<p>Look out for my full review soon.</p>\n<h2>Exploro RaceMax Boost spec and pricing</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.3t.bike/en/235-boost\" target=\"_blank\">Boost range</a> is compact with just three models currently available; both the drop-bar and flat-bar versions are priced at £7,299 / $6,999 / €6,999, while the Racemax Boost Ultralight costs £10,299 / $9,999/ €10,199.</p>\n<h3>3T Exploro Racemax Boost GRX</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Racemax Boost is fitted with a 3T Apto Stealth stem and Superergo PRO alloy bar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame</strong>: Exploro RaceMax – BOOST</li>\n<li><strong>Motor</strong>: Mahle ebikemotion X35 System</li>\n<li><strong>Frame material</strong>: Unidirectional pre-preg carbon, high-modulus/high-strength performance blend layup</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong>: Fango RaceMax with compact crown</li>\n<li><strong>Headset</strong>: 3T MinMax custom by Cane Creek IS42/28.6 + IS 47/38</li>\n<li><strong>Handlebar</strong>: Superergo PRO alloy (XXS: 38cm / 51: 40cm / 54 &amp;
