To develop a cap from the ground up that is tailor made specifically for cyclists, in partnership with such an iconic headwear manufacturer is a really exciting new chapter for our brand”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The side panels are a wicking mesh material.</span></figcaption><span> <i>MAAP × New Era</i></span></div>\n<p>The classic cycling casquette (that’s French for “cap”, and as we know, using loanwords is more authentic) is an iconic piece of cycling fashion, one that’s sometimes worn as an off-the-bike signifier that someone belongs to the tribe of cyclists.</p>\n<p>Some riders swear by them come rain or shine, while others can’t fathom wearing a hat under a helmet.</p>\n<p>Is a summer cycling cap with street cred what your wardrobe has been missing?
