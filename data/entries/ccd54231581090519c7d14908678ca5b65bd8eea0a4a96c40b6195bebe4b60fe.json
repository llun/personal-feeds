Code recently found in tvOS 14.5 suggested the new ‌Apple TV‌ could support 4K 120Hz output, but that does not appear to be the case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with HDMI 2.1, the new ‌Apple TV‌ supports 802.11ax WiFi 6 with MIMO. Apple has been introducing WiFi 6 support in its newest devices, and WiFi 6 is the newest and fastest WiFi protocol available with improved speeds, expanded network capacity, lower latency, better power efficiency, and upgraded performance in locations with many smart home devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple TV‌ 4K is the second Apple device that has built-in Thread support, following the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>. Thread is a low-power networking technology that offers a secure, mesh-based system able to interface with other Thread-enabled smart home devices for improved connectivity.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThough not mentioned in the ‌Apple TV‌ specifications, the tvOS 14.5 beta suggests that the new ‌Apple TV‌ model supports eARC, which offers a bandwidth and speed boost for sending higher-quality audio from the TV to a soundbar or receiver.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-tv-4k-thread-wifi-6-hdmi-2-1/\">New Apple TV 4K Supports WiFi 6, Thread and HDMI 2.1</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-4k-supports-wifi-6-thread-and-hdmi-2-1.2292423/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cGHPln2czCY:BaWa5kiXLS8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cGHPln2czCY:BaWa5kiXLS8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cGHPln2czCY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ccd54231581090519c7d14908678ca5b65bd8eea0a4a96c40b6195bebe4b60fe","category":"Apple"}
