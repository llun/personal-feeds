The Oregonian, a local newspaper in Oregon where Intel\nmaintains a large presence, <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/01/intel-will-wait-for-new-ceo-to-make-critical-decisions-on-manufacturing-crisis.html\">reports that the chip maker</a> held\nan all-hands company meeting yesterday, and Gelsinger attended.</p>\n\n<p>“We have to deliver better products to the PC ecosystem than any\npossible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino” makes,\nGelsinger reportedly told Intel employees. “We have to be that\ngood, in the future.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you’d imagine, Gelsinger’s description of Apple <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/210115/p13#a210115p13\">got a fair amount of attention</a>, with most reports, including The Oregonian’s original, taking it as a “derisive” jab. Claim chowder material, if you will.</p>\n\n<p>I doubt that’s how he meant it. It wasn’t a public statement, and we don’t have video or audio, so maybe he did mean it derisively. In which case, well, good luck. But I really doubt it. My guess is that if you heard him saying it, it would be obvious he was making a joke and referring to Apple in a jokey “<em>they who shall not be named</em>” way. As the incoming CEO of Intel, surely Gelsinger knows enough to see that Apple has completely eclipsed Intel. Apple’s chips are better designed, and thanks to their fab partner TSMC, better made. This isn’t conjecture, these are facts, and computer chip facts are among the coldest and hardest facts in the world.</p>\n\n<p>The gold standard for foot-in-the-mouth derisive claim chowder is Ed Colligan — then-CEO of Palm — in late November 2006, <a href=\"http://archive.is/UJW9V\">just five weeks before Apple unveiled the then-only-rumored iPhone</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Responding to questions from New York Times correspondent John\nMarkoff at a Churchill Club breakfast gathering Thursday morning,\nColligan laughed off the idea that any company — including the\nwildly popular Apple Computer — could easily win customers in the\nfinicky smart-phone sector.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how\nto make a decent phone,” he said. “PC guys are not going to just\nfigure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”</p>\n\n<p>What if Steve Jobs’ company did bring an iPod phone to market?\nWell, it would probably use Wi-Fi technology and could be\ndistributed through the Apple stores and not the carriers like\nVerizon or Cingular, Colligan theorized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s a bit from the column I wrote at the time. It holds up pretty well. “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/colligan_head_stuck\">Palm CEO Ed Colligan’s Head Seems to be Stuck Somewhere</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I saw this last week, and it took me until today to stop laughing\nand try to figure out a way to write about it. It’s a simple\nlittle three-sentence quote, but I’m not sure what I like best\nabout it.</p>\n\n<p>Is it the way he describes Apple as “PC guys”? As in like, <em>These\nguys just make computers, they don’t understand the nuances of\nuser interface and experience design, especially with regard, to,\nuh, handheld consumer electronics. Nope, no handheld consumer\nelectronics expertise at Apple. By the way, let me show you how my\nTreo can play MP3s!</em></p>\n\n<p>Or is it the fact that Palm is using Microsoft’s Windows Mobile OS\non some of its Treo phones? Apple, they’re just “PC guys”, but\nMicrosoft, they’re connoisseurs of elegant UI design, apparently.</p>\n\n<p>No, no. What I like best is where Colligan says Palm has\n“struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make a decent\nphone.” Isn’t it possible that, <em>if</em> Apple is indeed entering the\nmobile phone market, that Apple has also struggled with the\nproblem for a few years? It’s just that Apple hasn’t been selling\ntheir less-than-decent designs along the way, like Palm has. (It’s\nalso certainly the case that an Apple phone would aspire to\nsomething better than “decent”.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t see that sort of blind bluster in Gelsinger’s description of “a lifestyle company in Cupertino”. The line comes across poorly in print, but my guess is that in person, he said it in a manner that wasn’t putting Apple down, per se, but rather building Intel up. “<em>If they can do it, we can do it — we’re Intel.</em>” It’s easy to imagine how such a line, played for a laugh, would work amongst an audience of Intel employees — who themselves are very much aware of Apple’s chipmaking prowess. (Many talented engineers who previously worked at Intel have moved to the lifestyle industry.)</p>\n\n<p>Again, the M1 Macs are out. Everyone at Intel knows they’re both faster <em>and</em> <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201897\">consume less power</a> than Intel’s chips. And they know, because it’s already happened, that nearly the entire MacOS software ecosystem made the transition just fine. Legacy Mac software isn’t going to buy Intel <em>any</em> time at all. And we haven’t even seen Apple’s high-end laptop or workstation chips yet. They all know Apple’s Mac business was good business for Intel, and now it’s gone. They lost it.</p>\n\n<p>Ed Colligan in late 2006 quite obviously had no idea what was about to happen to Palm. He really didn’t seem knowledgeable enough to be worried — not about how technically shitty Palm’s hardware and (especially) software stacks were, nor how good Apple’s were (in the wake of Mac OS X and the iPod). He was like the captain on The Titanic dismissing any concerns about icebergs as nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>Gelsinger, speaking in early 2021, knows that Intel fell behind years ago — in an industry where it’s notoriously hard to catch up. He’s taking over a ship that already hit an iceberg and is in need of saving. Sometimes you talk trash about your opponent because you’re an idiot. But other times, you talk a little trash to fire up your <em>own</em> team.</p>\n\n<p>This feels like that to me.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2021-01-21\">\n<p>I’m linking here to The Verge’s story, not <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/01/intel-will-wait-for-new-ceo-to-make-critical-decisions-on-manufacturing-crisis.html\">The Oregonian’s original report</a>, because The Oregonian has the story behind a subscriber-only paywall.
