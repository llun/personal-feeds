The clickpad also supports touch gestures, with the outer ring supporting a circular \"jog\" gesture that Apple says will help you find the exact spot you're looking for in a video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Siri Remote is larger than the prior version and it includes a dedicated power button that controls a TV's power. It also includes volume buttons, a mute button, an option for pausing and fast forwarding, and a menu button. Additionally, there's a side button for activating Siri.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new version of the Siri Remote is compatible with the previous generation Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD. This makes it perfect for anyone who has a 2017 Apple TV model and doesn't feel the need to purchase the new model, but still wants the upgraded Siri Remote.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/20/deals-first-discount-siri-remote/\">Deals: First Discount Hits Apple's New Siri Remote, Get it for $49.97 on Verizon ($9 Off)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-first-discount-hits-apples-new-siri-remote-get-it-for-49-97-on-verizon-9-off.2296912/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7TQAB44WFCM:ygk7ebEcBEs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7TQAB44WFCM:ygk7ebEcBEs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7TQAB44WFCM\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1f40b7c26e6f9a68be848ce4ffa79fe3889ee236b92c92a57353e66e00e5afca","category":"Apple"}
