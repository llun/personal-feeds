Menus and prompts have also been streamlined across Firefox to have cleaner designs and clearer language. The more consistent styling extends to many other elements of the browser.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirefox 89 also features floating tabs that contain information and other cues when you need them, like visual indicators for audio controls.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nFor macOS users, Firefox 89 now features the familiar \"elastic\" scrolling effect utilized in many other applications. A gentle bouncing animation will indicate that you reached the end of the page while scrolling.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAnother feature added for macOS users is support for multi-touch \"smart zoom.\" Users can double tap with two fingers on the trackpad, or with a single finger on the Magic Mouse, to zoom the content beneath the cursor into focus. This multi-touch gesture has long been supported by Apple's default Safari browser as well as Google Chrome.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFirefox 89 contextual menus are now native on macOS and support Dark Mode too.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe complete Firefox 89 release notes can be found <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/\">on the Mozilla website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/firefox/\">Firefox</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/firefox-89-for-mac-released/\">Firefox 89 for Mac Released With Cleaner Design, Multi-Touch Zoom, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/firefox-89-for-mac-released-with-cleaner-design-multi-touch-zoom-and-more.2298780/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KUTBh3SREE0:-zIFAFK65vY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KUTBh3SREE0:-zIFAFK65vY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KUTBh3SREE0\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88e08229a8e2f9446c3ac5d34903c1e1cfb41302dcc377b20110e9cf6aaf489e","category":"Apple"}
