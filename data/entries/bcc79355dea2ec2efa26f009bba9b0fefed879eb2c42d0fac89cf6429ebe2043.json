The Bora Ultra WTOs are the latest iteration to roll off the production line in Campagnolo’s Vicenza HQ - for all Bora wheels are developed, tested and manufactured in-house.</p>\n<p>The new wheels, while similar in overall appearance to the Bora WTO model they supplant at the top of Campagnolo’s racing wheel range, have been wholly redesigned thanks to a ‘considerable investment in production facilities’.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says that has allowed the development of new technologies, which have been applied in the Bora Ultra WTOs to develop them beyond the Bora WTOs. The R&amp;D process has apparently taken nearly three years and has deployed several patented innovations.</p>\n<p>As a result, the new wheels are said to be around 100g lighter, more aerodynamic, and a good chunk more expensive too, retailing at £2,810.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9499/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto-wheel-gallery#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/campagnoloboraultrawto6_crop.jpg?itok=-HLxmJ_7\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>From the outside in</h3>\n<p>Coming in the same selection of depths as the Bora WTOs (33mm, 45mm, 60mm), the shape of the Bora Ultra WTO wheeset's rim is broadly similar to the regular version too – the 21mm internal width is carried over for the 33mm rim, while the 45mm and 60mm rims share the same 19mm internal width.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly the recommended 25mm tyre width for best performance has remained unchanged too.</p>\n<p>The rim does benefit from a new construction method though that Campagnolo dubs Hand Made Ultra-Light Carbon, or HULC for short.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says it uses a proprietary carbon composite and a new production method to shed weight and minimise defects.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9499/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto-wheel-gallery#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/campagnoloboraultrawto5_crop.jpg?itok=wQlY8FG2\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>According to the brand, the new rim construction plays a large role in the Bora Ultra WTO wheels' weight advantage over the regular Bora WTOs, which is claimed to be around 100g dependent on rim depth. As an example, the Bora WTO 45 Disc wheelset weighs 1,520g while the Bora Ultra WTO 45 Disc wheelset weighs 1,425g.</p>\n<p>The rims also get a fancy new finish too. Labelled ‘C-Lux’, the Bora Ultra WTOs high gloss appearance is a beneficial side-effect of the rim’s fabrication method. It is an attribute borrowed from the construction of Campagnolo’s carbon cranks, which similarly come out of the mould with no finishing required.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9499/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto-wheel-gallery#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/campagnoloboraultrawto4_crop.jpg?itok=pWXiEtno\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Campagnolo says because the rim doesn’t require lacquer, the finish is harder-wearing and the rim itself can be lighter.</p>\n<p>Most unusually, the glossy C-Lux finish even extends into the rim channel. Being undrilled anyway (the spoke nipples are inserted through the valve hole and positioned in their seats around the rim using a magnet – more on that later), the rims don’t need to be taped to be tubeless compatible.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says the combination of these two features creates a precise, smooth surface, ensuring tubeless tyres are safe and easy to set up.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9499/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto-wheel-gallery#6\"><p><span>Image 7 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/campagnoloboraultrawto7_crop.jpg?itok=Ubl1L0qd\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 7 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Novel nipples</h3>\n<p>High-end Campagnolo wheels have used the brand’s ‘Mo-Mag’ nipple technology for several years but the Bora Ultra WTOs build on that feature with a few key updates.</p>\n<p>The new wheels use an ‘Aero Mo-Mag’ design. The nipples are still guided into seats within the rim chamber via a magnet, but where in the past Campagnolo has brought the nipples through to protrude and attach to the spokes externally, that connection is now made internally.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/7725/welcome-to-the-fold-behind-the-scenes-at-brompton\">Welcome to the fold: behind the scenes at Brompton</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/brompton/8859/brompton-folding-bikes-a-full-guide-to-the-range\">Brompton folding bikes: A full guide to the range</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/brompton/electric/5244/brompton-electric-bike-review\">Brompton Electric bike review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe nipples are totally hidden, which together with the elliptical spokes used in Campagnolo’s G3 lacing pattern can potentially result in cleaner airflow and better aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo has cleverly averted the maintenance pitfalls of traditional internal nipples too, allowing external spoke tension adjustment to be carried out using a supplied proprietary spoke key.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9499/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto-wheel-gallery#7\"><p><span>Image 8 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/campagnoloboraultrawto8_crop.jpg?itok=cndBMkmq\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 8 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Hub upgrade</h3>\n<p>Both hubs use the same hourglass shape as before which is said to maximise aerodynamic efficiency, but the front hub has received some exciting redevelopment in terms of construction material.</p>\n<p>The hub body (aside from the brake-side flange) is now made out of unidirectional carbon and has been given the same C-LUX finish as the rims.

The Bora Ultra WTO 60s took the place of some wheels with a 45mm rim depth in a bike I know well.</p>\n<p>Yet despite possessing rims some 15mm deeper, the Bora Ultra WTO 60s’ weight was within 10g of the other wheelset. As a result, the wheels did not feel noticeably slower to accelerate or more sluggish when it came to climbing hills.</p>\n<p>That suggests that in the Bora Ultra WTO, Campagnolo has incorporated the promise of extra aerodynamic efficiency while minimising the usual associated penalties of deeper rims.</p>\n<p>The drag-reducing properties you’d expect of rims at this depth are certainly in evidence. They felt tenacious in their ability to hold high speeds. That is perhaps unsurprising considering the pedigree of the Bora’s wind-cheating rim profile, which Campagnolo has honed for over two decades.</p>\n<p>I’d need more time to use the wheels in a wider range of weather conditions in order to confidently judge their crosswind stability, but the early signs are promising.</p>\n<p>In my experience, rims at this depth tend to be affected by sidewinds regardless of any nuanced difference in rim shape, but the Bora Ultra WTO 60s did tend to cope with any lateral pressure predictably.</p>\n<p>I’m inclined to believe the inclusion of Campagnolo’s CULT ceramic bearings did nothing to dispel the wheels’ feeling of overall speed either. While I’ll admit this might just be the psychological consequence of knowing the wheels use them, I did get the feeling that the Bora Ultra WTOs roll impeccably smoothly.</p>\n<p>The wheels’ solid build quality is likely a contributing factor as well. As it tends to do with all its products, at the launch of the Bora Ultra WTO wheels Campagnolo made a point of explaining the new wheels are built to be a reliable product as well as a high performance one.</p>\n<p>Again, I’d need more time using the wheels to ascertain some meaningful insights into their durability but that onus on wheels being built to last is the reason for features like the complex ‘Aero Mo-Mag’ internal nipple system as well as the ‘C-Lux’ finished, undrilled rim channels.</p>\n<p>The only set of tubeless tyres I got the opportunity to fit went on easily enough – not straight up with a track pump, instead requiring a little soapy water on the tyre beads and a shot with an Airshot canister – but as tubeless installs go, it was straightforward.</p>\n<p>More time and more sets of tyres would allow me to properly judge the efficacy of the Bora Ultra WTO wheels' rim design, but regardless it is good to see tubeless technology embraced to such an extent by a company as traditional as Campagnolo, even if the rim channel stays at at a now-conservative 19mm internal width.</p>\n<p>Given the impressions I’ve been left with after my time aboard them so far I look forward to using them more so that I can put together a more comprehensive review.
