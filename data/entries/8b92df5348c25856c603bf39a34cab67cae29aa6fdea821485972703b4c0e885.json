João Almeida rounded out the overall podium at 1:02 down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it happened</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the flat profile, the final stage did feature some uncertainty for the GC battle as crosswinds in the desert helped split the peloton into echelons with some 60 km to go. Pogacar and Yates were both in the front group, with Almeida in a group of chasers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group of Pogacar and Yates caught the early break and opened a gap of around 30 seconds on those chasing, but the gap soon began to come down. Things came back together with around 45 km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a little over 40 km to go, Yates hit the deck hard. Although he sustained a cut to his face in the fall, he was able to remount and rejoin the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the sprinters&#8217; teams geared up for the final kick, Deceuninck-Quick-Step surged to the front of the pack. Michael Morkov led into the finishing straight, but in the final sprint, Ewan came around to best Bennett for the win, his first of 2021. Bennett settled for second with Bauhaus in third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogacar finished with the pack to wrap up the GC title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stage 7 results</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 EWAN Caleb (Lotto Soudal) 3:18:29<br>2 BENNETT Sam (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step)<br>3 BAUHAUS Phil (Bahrain &#8211; Victorious)<br>4 MORKOV Michael (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step)<br>5 BOL Cees (Team DSM)<br>6 GREIPEL André (Israel Start-Up Nation)<br>7 VENDRAME Andrea (AG2R Citroën Team)<br>8 MEZGEC Luka (Team BikeExchange)<br>9 MINALI Riccardo (Intermarché &#8211; Wanty &#8211; Gobert Matériaux)<br>10 GIDICH Yevgeniy (Astana &#8211; Premier Tech)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 POGACAR Tadej (UAE-Team Emirates) 24:00:28<br>2 YATES Adam (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:35<br>3 ALMEIDA João (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 1:02<br>4 HARPER Chris (Team Jumbo-Visma) 1:42<br>5 POWLESS Neilson (EF Education &#8211; Nippo) 1:45<br>6 SKJELMOSE JENSEN Mattias (Trek &#8211; Segafredo) 2:37<br>7 CARUSO Damiano (Bahrain &#8211; Victorious) 2:39<br>8 CATTANEO Mattia (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 3:53<br>9 FERNÁNDEZ Rubén (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits) 4:13<br>10 MASNADA Fausto (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 6:30</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/pogacar-wins-the-uae-tour-as-ewan-nabs-the-final-stage/\">Pogacar wins the UAE Tour as Ewan nabs the final stage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8b92df5348c25856c603bf39a34cab67cae29aa6fdea821485972703b4c0e885","category":"Cycling"}
