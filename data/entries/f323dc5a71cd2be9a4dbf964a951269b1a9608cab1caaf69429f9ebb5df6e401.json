Are they really as fast and light as brands say they are? Should you really consider switching from latex or ultra-thin butyl? That’s neither here nor there, because Tubolito’s new X-Tubo City/Tour inner tube isn’t going after performance. These are purpose-built to tackle another issue: flats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of going the super light route, the X-Tubo City/Tour goes the super durable route with some sort of “extremely strong” variant of Tubolito’s trademark orange polyurethane material. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With all of the inner tubes Tubolito manufactures for themselves and their competitors, the different genres (i.e. road, CX/gravel, and MTB) use wholly different TPU formulas,” explained Tubolito’s US media relations agent, Logan Vonbokel of Haute Route Media. “The X-Tubo also uses a wholly different TPU formula when compared to other models, which is also how they are able to offer it at a lower price point compared to some of the performance oriented tubes that require a much higher level of manufacturer precision.”</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’d expect, the X-Tubo City/Tour is quite a bit heavier than the company’s other models. Whereas Tubolito’s standard gravel tube tips the scales at around 60 g, and the standard City/Tour at 91 g, the X-Tubo City/Tour is 130 g. However, that’s still lighter than standard butyl rubber tubes — and heaps lighter than thorn-proof butyl tubes — and there are no restrictions on what type of brakes can be used, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That weight gain suggests an increase in wall thickness in addition to the chemical formulation itself, but either way, Tubolito claims the changes dramatically improve the puncture resistance of the X-Tubo City/Tour — so much so that the company is offering a one-year warranty against any types of flats: snake bites, glass, nails, tacks, whatever. Tubolito requires you to register the tube within a month of purchase, but that seems like a small price to pay. Air retention is likely excellent, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tubolito-X-Tubo-City-Tour-inner-tube-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Despite the heady claims about puncture resistance, the X-Tubo tubes are still pretty light and compact.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean you’ll never flat while using the X-Tubo City/Tour (surely Tubolito has contracted an actuary to calculate the financial wisdom of this policy). There are also questions such as how long it’ll take to get a replacement tube from Tubolito (and how), what these things ride like, and — most importantly — whether they’re even as flat-proof as Tubolito claims. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m personally super intrigued to try these, although Tubolito unfortunately is initially only offering them in a single 700×30-50 mm size (but with Presta or Schrader valves), so I can’t use them on my Urban Arrow daily driver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail price is US$30 / £23 / €25. Australian pricing is to be confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found at <a href=\"https://www.tubolito.com/product/x-tubo-city-tour/\" target=\"_blank\">www.tubolito.com</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/tubolitos-new-x-tubo-city-tour-inner-tube-guarantees-against-flats-for-a-year/\">Tubolito’s new X-Tubo City/Tour inner tube guarantees against flats for a year</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f323dc5a71cd2be9a4dbf964a951269b1a9608cab1caaf69429f9ebb5df6e401","category":"Cycling"}
