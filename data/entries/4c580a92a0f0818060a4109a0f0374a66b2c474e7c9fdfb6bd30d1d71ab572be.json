The event organiser says that 'participants will take in Tom’s favourite Yorkshire climbs and some of his most-used training roads'.</p>\n<p>Pidcock himself will be present on the day, giving riders the chance to grab a startline photo with a rider who in relatively short order has gone from 'that young lad is quite good at riding a bike' to 'oh look, Pidcock is outsprinting WorldTour veterans'.</p>\n<p>Both routes will start and finish in Ilkley and take in the stunning Yorkshire Dales.</p>\n<p>'As a young rider I trained on the grippy Yorkshire roads,' Pidcock said on the launch of the event. 'For sure, they made me the rider I am today. I’m really excited to be showcasing what I believe to be the best of the Yorkshire Dales in this event.'</p>\n<p><strong>Entries now open: <a href=\"https://ridethestruggle.com/products/tom-pidcock-gran-fondo\" target=\"_blank\">ridethestruggle.com</a></strong></p>\n<h3>The Tom Pidcock Gran Fondo: Routes</h3>\n<h4>Long route: 180km, 2430m</h4>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/04/tom_pidcock_gran_fondo_long-route.jpg?itok=oDCkNZte\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Taking in three categorised climbs – Kidstone Pass at 48km, Fleet Moss at 84km and Halton Gill at 124km – this will be a big day out for anyone, especially those not at WorldTour level.</p>\n<p>Covering 180km and well over 2,000 metres of elevation, <a href=\"/in-depth/1747/the-cyclist-guide-to-the-right-gear-ratios-for-climbing\">consider your gear ratios</a> before setting off for Yorkshire.</p>\n<h4>Short route: 110km, 1423m</h4>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/04/tom_pidcock_gran_fondo_short_route.jpg?itok=v1eSbnp1\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The 'short route' covers 70km less and has only one of the aforementioned categorised climbs, but this is Yorkshire so you're still not in for an easy day out. That one climb only accounts for a fraction of the 1,423 metres of total elevation so expect a lumpy ride out from and back to Ilkley.</p>\n<h3>Struggle Events, the clue's in the name</h3>\n<p>Yorkshire's own Struggle Events will be hosting and delivering the event. The routes and profiles are typical of the company as its events really test anyone who takes them on.</p>\n<p>'The long route is 180km, featuring a shark-tooth profile including Kidstones, Fleet Moss (<em>the hard side</em>) and the hidden gem climb of Halton Gill. There’s also a 110km route available, making the Tom Pidcock Gran Fondo achievable for any ambitious road cyclist,' said Struggle Events Director Matt Mannakee.</p>\n<p>'With cycling events now back up and running in the UK after the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s exciting to see a high-profile professional rider putting on a brand new Gran Fondo in Yorkshire.</p>\n<p>'The Tom Pidcock Gran Fondo features one of the UK’s toughest climbs - Fleet Moss – which is 3.4 miles (5.5km) long with an average 6% gradient maxing out at 15.5%. It’s going to be a tough ride.'</p>\n<p>The inaugural Tom Pidcock Gran Fondo is now open for pre-registration. Entries are set to go live at midday on Friday 30th April 2021. <strong>Entries now open: <a href=\"https://ridethestruggle.com/products/tom-pidcock-gran-fondo\" target=\"_blank\">ridethestruggle.com</a></strong></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full route details for this year's race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9561/join-our-giro-ditalia-fantasy-league\">Join our Giro d'Italia fantasy league</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/04/link_my_ride_tom_pidcock.jpg?itok=UjroSqP8\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Link My Ride</h3>\n<p>Along with lighting up the <a href=\"/tags/cycling-spring-classics\">Spring Classics</a>, training for the Olympics and backing this sportive, Pidcock has also launched a new app: Link My Ride.</p>\n<p>The app has been made to be a new worldwide social community app for cyclists.
