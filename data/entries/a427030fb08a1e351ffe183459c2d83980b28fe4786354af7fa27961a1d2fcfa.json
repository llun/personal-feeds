Even webcams recommended by reputable outlets produce poor quality imagery—a significant failing, given it’s the one job they’re supposed to provide.</p>\n\n<p>Uneven color. Blown highlights. Smudgy detail, especially in low light. Any affordable webcam (even at the high end of affordability, $100+), uses inadequate and typically years-old hardware backed by mediocre software that literally makes you look bad. You might not notice this if you’re using video software that makes your own image small, but it will be obvious to other people on the call.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reincubate makes <a href=\"https://reincubate.com/camo/\">Camo</a>, a good app that lets you use an iPhone as a live webcam with your Mac, so you might think, well, <em>of course</em> an article on the Reincubate blog is going to conclude that an iPhone provides better image quality than a webcam. But you know and I know it’s true: iPhone camera image quality is <em>way</em> higher than that of even “good” webcams. Carlson has taken the time here to explain why and prove it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Jeff Carlson on Why Webcams Suck’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/17/carlson-webcams\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a427030fb08a1e351ffe183459c2d83980b28fe4786354af7fa27961a1d2fcfa","category":"Tech"}
