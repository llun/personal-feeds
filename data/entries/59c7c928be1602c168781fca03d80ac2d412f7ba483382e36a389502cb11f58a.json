That's a significant decrease from the 30,000+ titles Apple for which Apple originally requested data.</p>\n<p>In resisting the subpoena, Valve argued that its Steam sales data was irrelevant to questions about the purely mobile app marketplaces at issue in the case. Refocusing the request only on games available on both Steam and the Epic Games Store makes it more directly relevant to the questions of mobile competition in the case, Judge Thomas Hixson <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.356.0.pdf\">writes in his order</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745240#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745240&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59c7c928be1602c168781fca03d80ac2d412f7ba483382e36a389502cb11f58a","category":"Tech"}
