Teams began jockeying for position as the peloton neared a late uncategorized ascent, and then with the pack lined out, Francesco Gavazzi (Eolo-Kometa) jumped off the front with around a kilometer to go. Daniel Oss (Bora-Hansgrohe) marked the move, however, and the rest of the field soon caught up to the pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fernando Gaviria (UAE-Team Emirates) launched from afar with 400 meters still to go and opened up a gap as the riders went through the last few corners of a winding finale, but Ewan closed him down and then exploded past in the last 200 meters. He held on to take a clear win with Davide Cimolai (Israel Start-Up Nation) settling for second on the day and Tim Merlier (Alpecin-Fenix) nabbing third. Attila Valter (Groupama-FDJ) finished safely on the day to retain the overall race lead.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Giro d'Italia (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>Notaresco → Termoli</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255974\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">EWAN Caleb</a>\n                                            <span>Lotto Soudal</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>04:42:12</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">CIMOLAI Davide</a>\n                                            <span>Israel Start-Up Nation</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>3</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">MERLIER Tim</a>\n                                            <span>Alpecin-Fenix</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>00:00:00</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>4</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">MOSCHETTI Matteo</a>\n                                            <span>Trek -
