We can super tuck until our heart’s content and wear socks as long as our arms if we like, but for those who do like rules, Rapha has finally made the EF Education – Nippo’s team kit available to buy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Said to be the world’s most compliant kit, we <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/01/rules-are-made-to-be-obeyed-ef-education-nippo-unveil-new-uci-compliant-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">first saw the new kit design</a> on the eve of the European road season back in January. EF landed themselves in hot water with the UCI at last year’s Giro d’Italia with a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/check-out-efs-wild-palace-kit-for-the-giro-ditalia/\" target=\"_blank\">limited edition kit</a> designed in a collaboration with skate brand Palace. That limited edition Giro kit sold out almost instantly and had fans eagerly awaiting the team’s 2021 design. It also got them fined by the UCI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not as radical as the Palace kit, the team did not disappoint taking a tongue in cheek approach by printing measurements and design work on the jersey to demonstrate compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.uci.org/docs/default-source/equipment/clarificationguideoftheucitechnicalregulation-2018-05-02-eng_english.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UCI technical regulations</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha is offering the team design in men’s and women’s Pro Team Aero jerseys, Pro Team bib-shorts, Pro Team Socks, plus a snood and a musette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new kit is currently available at <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/collections/ef-education-nippo/category/EF\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha.cc</a> but perhaps not for long, if it proves anywhere near as popular as the Palace kit </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EF-Education-kit-2021-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>From a distance, the kit looks quite normal, but it’s up close that the level of detail is obvious</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ef-Education-team-kit-2021-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Even the bib uppers get the creative “compliant” design</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EF-Education-snood-1340x754.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EF-Educaiton-Socks-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.uci.org/docs/default-source/equipment/clarificationguideoftheucitechnicalregulation-2018-05-02-eng_english.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">UCI Rule ARTICLE 1.3.033 BIS</a> compliant socks</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EF-Education-mussette--1340x754.jpg\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EF-Educaiton-2021-Musette-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>This is one musette that should be easy to spot</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/compliance-for-the-masses-ef-educations-2021-kit-goes-on-sale/\">Compliance for the masses – EF Education’s 2021 kit goes on sale</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9a0f74e7858a5f264d5160cdc39509c5a57b54fb57fcb2669ad54782887b3d59","category":"Cycling"}
