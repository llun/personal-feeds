A new YouTube video shows the process of opening and servicing the streaming box and its brand-new, fully redesigned remote.</p>\n<p>The internal components found in the new Apple TV 4K are not a surprise. The device contains Apple's A12 chip (the same found in the iPhone XS), which is a substantial upgrade for gaming performance over the A10 in the 2017 model. Apart from that, though, the machine looks pretty much the same as before.</p>\n<p>The 2021 Apple TV 4K ended up being simple to disassemble and service. Like its immediate predecessor, the new Apple TV 4K can be opened with a screwdriver, its components are modular, and those components are relatively easy to remove and put back in. As with the 2017 model, iFixit gave the streaming box an 8 out of 10 repairability score.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767833#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767833&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e0bd4d98a5eddb06bc77aafbb53a7f912fc3c08dd201d59eb43cb2552d91e87","category":"Tech"}
