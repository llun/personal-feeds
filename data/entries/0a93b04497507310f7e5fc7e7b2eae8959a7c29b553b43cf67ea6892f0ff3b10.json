{"title":"The 2021 Apple Design Award Finalists","link":"https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/","date":1622585261000,"content":"\n<p>Nice selection of apps and games from Apple. Some of the apps on the list that I’m familiar with: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-7-password-manager/id1333542190?mt=12\">1Password</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574\">Carrot Weather</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127\">Craft</a>, <a href=\"https://nova.app/\">Nova</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brief-unbiased-us-news/id1475186118\">Brief</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/not-boring-weather/id1531063436\">(Not Boring) Weather</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/universe-website-builder/id1211437633\">Universe</a>. Not one but <em>two</em> clever weather apps. Nova is the only app on the list that isn’t in the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite inclusion, though, is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/poolside-fm/id1514817810\">Poolside FM</a>, under the category “Delight and Fun”. There’s a <em>lot</em> of “delight and fun” on this list of finalists — again, Carrot Weather and (Not Boring) Weather — but Poolside FM’s entire point is delight and fun. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/09/03/poolside-fm\">As I wrote back in September</a>, “To team Poolside: 🍸.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/01/2021-ada-finalists\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0a93b04497507310f7e5fc7e7b2eae8959a7c29b553b43cf67ea6892f0ff3b10","category":"Tech"}
