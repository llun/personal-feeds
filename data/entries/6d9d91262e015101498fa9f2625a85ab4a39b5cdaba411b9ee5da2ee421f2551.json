Many customers who ordered the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJFM3LL/A/siri-remote\">new Siri Remote</a> separately are also seeing a May 21 delivery estimate, but we've yet to see these orders begin shipping at this time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Apple TV 4K features a faster A12 Bionic chip, support for high frame rate HDR and Dolby Vision video, and a redesigned Siri Remote with a physical clickpad that is also touch-enabled for swipe gestures that Apple TV users are familiar with. The outer ring of the clickpad supports a circular gesture for finding a scene in a movie or show.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $179 with 32GB of storage or $199 with 64GB of storage, the new Apple TV 4K will also be on display and available for purchase at Apple Store locations starting May 21, although supplies may be limited on launch day.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/new-apple-tv-4k-begins-shipping/\">New Apple TV 4K Orders Begin Shipping With May 21 Delivery</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-4k-orders-begin-shipping-with-may-21-delivery.2296820/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gNV1hYOdlKY:9XtsE2RBNKQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gNV1hYOdlKY:9XtsE2RBNKQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gNV1hYOdlKY\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d9d91262e015101498fa9f2625a85ab4a39b5cdaba411b9ee5da2ee421f2551","category":"Apple"}
