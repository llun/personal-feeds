But the team did fill in new intriguing details of the pandemic’s first crucial month—and ruled out sensational theories that the pandemic was born from a laboratory incident.</p>\n<p>“Our initial findings suggest that the introduction [to humans] through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway,” Peter Ben Embarek, WHO international team lead, said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ZOTdEmco0\">a 3-hour press conference on the team’s findings</a>, livestreamed from Wuhan on February 9. Though researchers in China have already surveyed 11,000 animals around the country in search of that host, all have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 so far, the team noted. Identifying the intermediary host “will require more studies and more specific targeted research,” Embarek added.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741018#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741018&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9743a75b140ef7328fd426aef70e5c448476cb23bb075263a22b3567c16df36a","category":"Tech"}
