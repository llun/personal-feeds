The display is attached to an adjustable mount that is connected to a traditional single-DIN chassis for compatibility with a wide range of vehicles, and the display can be tilted at four pre-set angles to better match the tilt and height of the dashboard.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe iLX-F409 is limited to wired CarPlay, but other brands like Pioneer have some wireless CarPlay receivers available.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOther features of the iLX-F409 include Android Auto support, hands-free Bluetooth phone calls, SiriusXM readiness, a USB-A port, one HDMI input and one HDMI output, and one rear-view camera input. When not in CarPlay mode, the receiver has a customizable user interface with 22 available widgets. The receiver does not have a built-in CD/DVD drive.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAlpine has offered a few 9-inch CarPlay receivers in the past, but this model has all of the latest features of the 11-inch iLX-F411.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alpine/\">Alpine</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/26/alpine-carplay-ilx-f409-receiver/\">Alpine&#039;s Latest CarPlay Receiver Has a 9-Inch Display Hovering Over the Dashboard</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alpines-latest-carplay-receiver-has-a-9-inch-display-hovering-over-the-dashboard.2286328/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yrVcTR-l_Co:kLgxsJUI7Uw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yrVcTR-l_Co:kLgxsJUI7Uw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/yrVcTR-l_Co\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"92bb19a27f095fb29a0ca4140af6eea45cc0d3b08d49d05877267c0136c8dc37","category":"Apple"}
