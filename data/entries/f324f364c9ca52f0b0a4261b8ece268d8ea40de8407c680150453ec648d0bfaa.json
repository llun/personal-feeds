Or continue on ‌iOS 14‌ and still get important security updates until you're ready to upgrade to the next major version.</blockquote>With prior updates, Apple has prompted users to update right away and has stopped signing past versions of iOS to make it impossible to downgrade, but it sounds like Apple is planning to relax that policy going forward.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis will be useful for those who are not able to update their devices because of device restrictions or requirements implemented by work organizations or schools.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-wont-make-you-upgrade-to-ios-15/\">Apple Won't Make You Upgrade to iOS 15 and Will Continue to Provide Security Updates for iOS 14</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wont-make-you-upgrade-to-ios-15-and-will-continue-to-provide-security-updates-for-ios-14.2299590/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=15fDP-hohcw:6t3N1bvaAXs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=15fDP-hohcw:6t3N1bvaAXs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/15fDP-hohcw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f324f364c9ca52f0b0a4261b8ece268d8ea40de8407c680150453ec648d0bfaa","category":"Apple"}
