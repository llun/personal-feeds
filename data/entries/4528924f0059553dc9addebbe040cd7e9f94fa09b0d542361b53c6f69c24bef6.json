He’d seen hundreds of such tracks along the Georgia coast. He’d photographed them, measured them, and drawn them. The difference here? This landing track was approximately<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pala.12082\" target=\"_blank\"> 105 million years old</a>.</p>\n<p>Dr. Anthony Martin, a popular professor at Emory University, recognized that landing track in Australia in the early 2000s when he passed by a fossil slab in a museum. “Because my eyes had been trained for so long from the Georgia coast seeing those kinds of patterns, that’s how I noticed them,” he said. “Because it literally was out of the corner of my eye. I was walking by the slab, I glanced at it, and then these three-toed impressions popped out at me.”</p>\n<p>Impressions of toes may seem to be pretty dull compared to a fully reconstructed skeleton. But many of us yearn for a window into ancient worlds, to actually see how long-extinct creatures looked, lived, and behaved. Paleontology lets us crack open that window; using fossilized remains, scientists glean information about growth rates, diet, diseases, and where species roamed. But there’s a lesser-known branch of paleontology that fully opens the window by exploring what the extinct animals <i>actually did</i>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767257#p3\">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767257&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4528924f0059553dc9addebbe040cd7e9f94fa09b0d542361b53c6f69c24bef6","category":"Tech"}
