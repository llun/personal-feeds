Sounds crazy to us but some folks think it’s possible. Since we launched the <a href=\"https://oregontimbertrail.org/\">Oregon Timber Trail</a> (OTT) in 2016 one of the most common questions is “How long does it take?” Most folks spend 2-3 weeks riding the almost 700 miles, but we’ve heard there’s been a few in the 11 day range.</p>\n<p>This year our curiosity has gotten the best of us—we’ve partnered with <a href=\"https://lairdsuperfood.com/\">Laird Superfood</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/mtb\">Rapha</a> to track Fastest Known Times (FKTs) on the whole OTT route and each of the four tiers. Similar to the Colorado Trail Race, The Arizona Trail Race, and the Tour Divide; the Timber Trail 700 is a free, unsupported endurance challenge. Anyone can attempt a record at any time, though we have a suggested start date of July 10th if you like company.<span id=\"more-207296\"></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207307\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>The Oregon Timber Trail spans the entire state, meandering almost 700 miles through four Tiers and nine Gateway Communities. It begins in the basin and range ancestral lands of the Modoc people and crosses a lost wagon train route over the Cascades into Kalapuya land—known to mountain bikers as the riding mecca of Oakridge. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207303\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-6.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Traveling back over the Cascade Range along the infamous Bunchgrass Ridge, the OTT passes dozens of swimming holes in the Deschutes Tier (Klamath land), and winds its way back over the watershed divide to where the headwaters of the McKenzie River bubble out of the ground. The Hood Tier starts with some of the best descending (and most heinous climbs) of the whole route in the Old Cascade Crest, slowly working its way north through ancestral Molalla land to Boulder Lake, Surveyors Ridge, and culminating with a flowy rip through Post Canyon and to the shores of the mighty Columbia River—home of the Wasco and Wishram people.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-207305\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/OTT-Race-8.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>We’re excited to welcome you back to the backcountry in 2021—it’s an incredible journey whether you ride it in 5 days or 5 weeks.
