The charges relate to a two-year-old antitrust dispute initiated by Spotify.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe European Commission was expected to bring charges against Apple over concerns that its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> rules break EU competition law this week, and ahead of a formal verdict, Margrethe Vestager, the EU's digital competition chief tweeted the preliminary findings of the commission:\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Our preliminary conclusion: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Apple</a> is in breach of EU competition law. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleMusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppleMusic</a> compete with other music streaming services.

It was also said that Apple was \"locking Spotify and other competitors out of Apple services such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, and Apple Watch,\" thereby making ‌‌Apple Music‌‌ a more attractive option for subscribers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe EU is expected to issue Apple with a charge sheet before the summer. It is not yet known what exactly the EU's sanctions could involve, but it has been suggested that Apple could be forced to pay a fine or make changes to its ‌‌App Store‌‌ business model in Europe to foster greater competition.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Spotify antitrust case is one of several opened by the European Commission into Apple's business practices in June last year. Apple has denied allegations of anti-competitive behavior, and said at the time of Spotify's complaint that its rival was using \"its financial motivations in misleading rhetoric.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/apple-in-breach-of-eu-competition-law/\">Apple in Breach of EU Competition Law, European Commission Finds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-in-breach-of-eu-competition-law-european-commission-finds.2294055/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pmV8dxG5bn4:xfNFE700oss:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pmV8dxG5bn4:xfNFE700oss:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pmV8dxG5bn4\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b1c4238f21e0711759d87d2fd469dbfb12e4f7891de4c30e8a7c5f3aa1d5de16","category":"Apple"}
