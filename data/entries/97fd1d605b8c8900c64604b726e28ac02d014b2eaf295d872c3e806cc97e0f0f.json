When a supported Adaptive-Sync display is connected to a compatible Mac, users will be able to enable Adaptive-Sync mode by selecting a new variable refresh rate option in System Preferences &gt; Displays.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAdaptive-Sync is a feature of the DisplayPort 1.2a specification, and it serves as the foundation of popular variable refresh rate display technologies like AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, which will now be supported on newer Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMacs gaining support for Adaptive-Sync displays will be particularly beneficial to gamers, as these displays can actively adjust their refresh rate to match a game's frame rate, providing smoother, lower-latency gameplay. Apps or games must be running in full-screen mode on macOS Monterey for Adaptive-Sync mode to function, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nmacOS Monterey is available now in beta for developers, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will be released in the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/macos-monterey-adaptive-sync-displays/\">macOS Monterey to Offer Smoother Gameplay With Support for Adaptive-Sync Displays on Newer Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-monterey-to-offer-smoother-gameplay-with-support-for-adaptive-sync-displays-on-newer-macs.2300448/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZCspgqU1-iE:m-Hd-nAdNbQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZCspgqU1-iE:m-Hd-nAdNbQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZCspgqU1-iE\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"97fd1d605b8c8900c64604b726e28ac02d014b2eaf295d872c3e806cc97e0f0f","category":"Apple"}
