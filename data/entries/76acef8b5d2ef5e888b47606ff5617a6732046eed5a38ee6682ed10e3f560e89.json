Using recycled materials is not enough, we also need to reduce the overall consumption of products.</p>\n<p>'We designed the Most Days collection to stand the test of time without compromising performance or aesthetics: buy less and buy better. We want our products to be your go-to choice, usable not just in the season you bought it, but in the years that follow.'</p>\n<p>Part of that philosophy is committing more to making fewer items, so Most Days includes one men's and one women's product per category. So the collection consists of: a jersey, bibshorts, a baselayer and a cap – which is of course unisex.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/4950/who-are-the-favourites-for-tour-de-france\">Who are the favourites for the 2021 Tour de France?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9390/chris-froome-tops-list-of-cyclings-top-earners-according-to-reports\">Chris Froome tops list of cycling's top earners, according to reports</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9628/chris-froome-posted-his-riding-playlist-so-we-rated-each-song\">Chris Froome posted his riding playlist so we rated each song</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 114: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIt will also be the first time Chpt3 offers women's-specific products, with a shape, feel and padding chosen to optimise comfort and aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>What's more, with the jersey available for £95 and shorts – the most expensive item – priced at £119, it is certainly more accessible than some of the brand's previous releases.</p>\n<p>The Most Days collection is available to the public from 8th June while early access for current members opened yesterday, for more information visit <a href=\"https://chpt3.com/\" target=\"_blank\">chpt3.com</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9720/chpt3-most-days-collection-images\">Chpt3 Most Days collection images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>4 Jun 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9720%2Fchpt3-most-days-collection-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Chpt3%20Most%20Days%20collection%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9720%2Fchpt3-most-days-collection-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Chpt3%20Most%20Days%20collection%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9720%2Fchpt3-most-days-collection-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Chpt3%20Most%20Days%20collection%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9720%2Fchpt3-most-days-collection-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9720/chpt3-most-days-collection-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 29</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/391922-d47a7594-065544-original-1622111797.jpg?itok=nSpUbmAZ\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/clothing\">Clothing</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/clothing\">Clothing</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"76acef8b5d2ef5e888b47606ff5617a6732046eed5a38ee6682ed10e3f560e89","category":"Cycling"}
