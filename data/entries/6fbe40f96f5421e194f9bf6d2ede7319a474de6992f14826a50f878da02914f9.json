No other genre captures my attention in the same way. The feeling of discovery, the community and competitive spiritâ€”a good release means potentially thousands of hours of playing and learning, not to mention all the sharing and talking with fellow players.</p>\n<p>This week I'm excited about <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jY4cyR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a>, releasing <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">April 9</a> on<a href=\"https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/\"> PS4, PS5, and PC</a>. There's an open beta this week, and Ars got early access to try it out, including the newly improved netcode.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to report that the beta is already doing the right things to make an online game feel as much like an offline one as possible.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742694#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742694&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Aurich Lawson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fbe40f96f5421e194f9bf6d2ede7319a474de6992f14826a50f878da02914f9","category":"Tech"}
