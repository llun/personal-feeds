It will look at the power that Apple and Google have over the cost, distribution, and availability of mobile apps on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Android devices.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/09/apple-refuses-to-testify-in-app-store-hearing/\">U.S. Senators Urge Apple to Reconsider Decision Not to Testify in Upcoming App Store Hearing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-senators-urge-apple-to-reconsider-decision-not-to-testify-in-upcoming-app-store-hearing.2291210/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JUWdCvnUQoI:i_L7tM4Sp_4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JUWdCvnUQoI:i_L7tM4Sp_4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JUWdCvnUQoI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9423646d78771ebfb9e59ec660f3053f359295a898932e28c4deb6e6cafdfc8e","category":"Apple"}
