{"title":"Apple Platform Security: Magic Keyboard With Touch ID","link":"https://support.apple.com/guide/security/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-secf60513daa/1/web/1","date":1622821423000,"content":"\n<p>Apple’s Platform Security has a good page on the details of how Touch ID works with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Silicon Macs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID performs the role of the\nbiometric sensor; it doesn’t store biometric templates, perform\nbiometric matching, or enforce security policies (for example,\nhaving to enter the password after 48 hours without an unlock).\nThe Touch ID sensor in the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID must be\nsecurely paired to the Secure Enclave on the Mac before it can be\nused, and then the Secure Enclave performs the enrollment and\nmatching operations and enforces security policies in the same way\nit would for a built-in Touch ID sensor. Apple performs the\npairing process in the factory for a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nthat is shipped with a Mac. Pairing can also be performed by the\nuser if needed. A Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely\npaired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure\npairings with up to five different Magic Keyboard with Touch ID\nkeyboards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I was wrong in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/secure_intent_on_apple_devices\">my article on “secure intent”</a> this week — the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID does <em>not</em> contain its own local Secure Enclave. It pairs with the Secure Enclave in the Mac with which it’s paired. But this contradicts <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-intent-connections-enclave-sec7a94f7d1e/web\">the Platform Security page about “secure intent”</a>, which states: “the connection is a physical link — from a physical button to the Secure Enclave”. The Magic Keyboard With Touch ID has a wireless, not physical, link to the paired Mac’s Secure Enclave. This Platform Security guide page has details about how Apple makes that work securely.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and built-in Touch ID sensors are\ncompatible. If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch\nID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the\nSecure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match — and\nvice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I did not know this — nifty.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"983ca729229936f97ea282209cabe1a866048cd3e8c75744c8faed61a75bc385","category":"Tech"}
