The series was created by Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day, known for their work on long running series \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMcElhenney plays Grimm, the studio's creative director, with David Hornsby starring as executive producer David Brittlesbee and Charlotte Nicdao playing lead engineer Poppy Li. The show also features Danny Pudi and F. Murray Abraham.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSeason 2 of \"Mythic Quest\" will focus on the team's efforts to create a new expansion for the game, building on the \"Raven's Banquet\" expansion that was featured in the first season.<blockquote>With the quarantine finally over, season two of \"Mythic Quest\" finds everyone back in the office (well, almost everyone), attempting to build upon the success of Raven's Banquet by launching an epic new expansion, but Ian (Rob McElhenney) and the newly promoted co-creative director, Poppy (Charlotte Nicdao), struggle with the game's direction. Meanwhile, C.W. (F. Murray Abraham) reconciles some unresolved issues from his past, the testers (Ashly Burch and Imani Hakim) test the bounds of an office romance, and David (David Hornsby) loses yet another woman in his life as Jo (Jessie Ennis) leaves him to assist Brad (Danny Pudi).</blockquote>While the first season was titled \"Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet,\" the Raven's Banquet part of the title has been dropped for the second season. Along with \"Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet,\" the cast of the show also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/20/mythic-quest-quarantine-episode-details/\">starred in a one-off</a> \"Mythic Quest: Quarantine\" episode that received rave reviews last spring.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-tv-plus-mythic-quest-season-2/\">&#039;Mythic Quest&#039; Season 2 Premiering on Apple TV+ on May 7</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mythic-quest-season-2-premiering-on-apple-tv-on-may-7.2285405/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RVIBSxY7aXQ:CM3oswjMjsQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RVIBSxY7aXQ:CM3oswjMjsQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RVIBSxY7aXQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6835d1de0b8c1794faef721d07fcfb65ef7b6a18c34ed15798d8de529fe03e66","category":"Apple"}
