The starting line is New York City and we’ll tour a southerly route via Fort Worth, Texas, to the West Coast, returning along a northerly route via Chicago, Illinois, to the finish line in New York. With a repurposed school bus as a mobile basecamp, we will journey from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and back, stopping in communities to ride our mountain bikes on some rad trails, advocate for BIPOC – all people! – to get on bikes to share in our journey, and to empower communities through hands-on wrench events, all while giving away over 1,200 bikes in the process.</p>\n<p>Head to <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/smiles-4-miles-tour?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+chico96c&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer\" target=\"_blank\">GoFundMe to donate</a> if you can and to <a href=\"https://www.smiles4milestour.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Smiles 4 Miles Tour</a> to read more!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ce83fa660c11e1eeef1af4963cf19bc573f4a7685f9a66558f273e11b92499dd","category":"Cycling"}
