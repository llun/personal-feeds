According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts&amp;xcust=1-1-343053-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a>, the next Apple TV and iPad might incorporate HomePod audio elements as part of a new push into the smart home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details are scarce, but Gurman says Apple “is working on a product that would combine an Apple TV set-top box with a HomePod speaker and include a camera for video conferencing through a connected TV and other smart-home functions.” The current Apple TV has no speaker, microphone, or camera, so the change would represent a massive shift for the device, which started in 2007 as a “hobby.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A camera and a speaker would instantly turn the Apple TV into a <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3613113/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-review.html\">Google Nest Hub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/3611170/amazon-echo-show-10-review.html\">Amazon Echo Show</a> competitor while giving Apple a much better position in the smart home race. After discontinuing the original HomePod earlier this year, Apple’s only smart home device is the $99 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234895/homepod-mini-review.html\">HomePod mini</a>, which offers Siri capabilities and music playback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also says Apple is working on a device that connects to an iPad with an iMac G4-like robotic arm that “can move to follow a user around a room.” Both Amazon newest Echo Show and the Facebook Portal featuring a camera that tracks users as they move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s not clear what an Apple TV with a camera would look like. As it stands, it’s a device that isn’t generally positioned in a way that would make it natural to use a camera, so adding video capabilities would fundamentally transform the way it’s used, even if it didn’t have a built-in screen. Gurman doesn’t give a timetable for a possible release of the new devices, but given that they’re in “early development,” they’re likely at least a year or more away.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a14497405b68984054a475ddf5c953d7643836c13112766e5923e0452fac94f6","category":"Apple"}
