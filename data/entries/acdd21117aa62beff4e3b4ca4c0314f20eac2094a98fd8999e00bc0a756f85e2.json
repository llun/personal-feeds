This offered a clear indication that SN11 would not attempt a launch on Friday.</p>\n<p>While it is possible that SpaceX could try to fly the Starship prototype on Saturday, the company has typically avoided weekend road closures in order to allow access to nearby beaches. Therefore it seems most likely that SpaceX will now target Monday of next week as the earliest opportunity to fly the vehicle. If that changes we will update accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Original post</strong>: SpaceX appears set to fly the latest prototype of its Starship vehicle—dubbed SN11—as early as Friday afternoon. Local residents have been informed of the test as part of a mandatory evacuation of Boca Chica Village.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752419#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752419&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"acdd21117aa62beff4e3b4ca4c0314f20eac2094a98fd8999e00bc0a756f85e2","category":"Tech"}
