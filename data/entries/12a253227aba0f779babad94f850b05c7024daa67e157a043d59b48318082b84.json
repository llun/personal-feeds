Additional retailers like <a href=\"http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/5bjE5o\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"http://goto.target.com/Zdr560\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"http://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Black%2F643659699\">Walmart</a> are also selling the earbuds, which come in white, black, and red.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/beats-studio-buds-red.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $149.99, the Beats Studio Buds feature a compact round design without any \"stems\" dropping below the ears. Like the AirPods Pro, the Beats Studio Buds feature active noise cancellation, and when you need to hear the world around you, you can switch to Transparency mode by pressing and holding the Beats logo button on either earbud.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple shared several new Beats Studio Buds support documents today:<ul><li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212254\">Set up and use your Beats Studio Buds</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212504\">Charge your Beats Studio Buds</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212505\">Reset your Beats Studio Buds</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212525\">Beats Studio Buds Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209590\">If your Beats Studio Buds are lost</a></li></ul>While the Beats Studio Buds support one-touch pairing for both Apple and Android devices via Bluetooth, they don't include Apple's H1 or W1 chip, so they're missing some AirPods features like automatic switching between Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther key features of the Beats Studio Buds include up to five hours of listening time per charge with active noise cancellation turned on, hands-free \"Hey Siri\" support, IPX4-rated sweat and water resistance, Find My support, and a USB-C charging case.
