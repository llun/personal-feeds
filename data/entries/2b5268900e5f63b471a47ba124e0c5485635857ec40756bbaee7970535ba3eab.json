Prior to creating Canoo, Kranz helped to develop the i3 and i8 vehicles at BMW, where he was employed for 30 years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Kranz's hiring is a sign that Apple is determined to build a self-driving vehicle that will rival Tesla. Kranz will report to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> lead Doug Fields, who works under AI chief John Giannandrea.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors about Apple's car project have picked up in recent months as Apple now appears to be looking for suppliers and manufacturing partners to develop the vehicle. There were rumors that Apple would work with Hyundai's Kia division, but it's not clear if that relationship has progressed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopment on the ‌Apple Car‌ remains in the early stages, and <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests that it will be at around five years before the product is ready to debut.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/10/apple-hires-former-bmw-exec-car-project/\">Apple Hires Self-Driving Car Startup Founder and Former BMW Exec Ulrich Kranz</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hires-self-driving-car-startup-founder-and-former-bmw-exec-ulrich-kranz.2300325/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IYBgNzJfBBQ:wTtgyyC0p3s:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IYBgNzJfBBQ:wTtgyyC0p3s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/IYBgNzJfBBQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2b5268900e5f63b471a47ba124e0c5485635857ec40756bbaee7970535ba3eab","category":"Apple"}
