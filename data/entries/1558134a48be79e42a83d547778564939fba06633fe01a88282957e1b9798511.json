(The other being the mouse or trackpad.) Using a keyboard effectively means moving fingers with the precision a computer can understand, often doing so faster than the speed of conscious thought. So although many people are fine with a cheap or default keyboard—as long as it registers keypresses reliably—others don't mind spending a bit more on something better.</p>\n<p>And then the real <em>connoisseurs</em> spend hundreds of dollars ordering parts from all over the world to build their own custom, dreamlike keyboard—a <em>mechanical</em> keyboard, of course, where each key has its own mechanical switch.</p>\n<p>I didn't want to go too far overboard when I recently, finally took the custom keyboard plunge. So I decided to get the pre-built but very customizable Drop CTRL instead. The <a href=\"https://fave.co/3ebm48A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drop CTRL</a> is a tenkeyless with 100 Hz individual RGB LEDs supporting hot-swappable Cherry MX style switches (plate-mount only) running the QMK firmware. It comes with OEM profile doubleshot PBT shine-through keycaps and a choice of switches. Phew. But, no, none of that is meaningless marketing talk.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747028#p3\">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747028&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Iljitsch van Beijnum","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1558134a48be79e42a83d547778564939fba06633fe01a88282957e1b9798511","category":"Tech"}
