You are reminded every time you wake up that\nyou can’t see,” says Edwards, who lost sight in her right eye by\nage 11 due to a rare genetic condition. When she was 17, a retinal\ndetachment in her left eye caused her to become completely blind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve got a soft spot for accessibility in general, but you say “retinal detachment” and you’ve got my attention.
