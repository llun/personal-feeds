{"title":"iPhone 12 MagSafe Cases Expanding to Include More Third-Party Companies Like Nomad and Casely","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/iphone-12-magsafe-cases-third-party/","date":1613681727000,"content":"Besides Apple's first-party <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> cases, there are a few options for third-party cases that include magnets within each case that are built to align directly with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> devices. An &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> placed within one of these cases can then connect to additional &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories, like Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafe-arrival-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3414\" height=\"1920\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-765325\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nOf course, an &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; within a thin enough case that lacks magnets will be able to attach to other &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories as well. For this reason, there aren't many companies who have released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-12-cases/\">iPhone 12 cases</a> specifically with magnets inside for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, but below we've rounded up a few options from some of the best third-party companies online.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magsafe-cases.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1819\" height=\"1513\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784282\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe difference in construction on the cases should be noted as well. Nomad and Moment, for example, have built magnets directly into the backs of each case, similar in style to Apple. Otterbox, on the other hand, places an adhesive sticker inside its cases that acts as the \"&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;\" portion of the accessory. Although they function the same, this design is worth noting. You can see the adhesive strip in more detail in the Otterbox case in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqawoDhXJ0&ab_channel=MacRumors\">our video on the MagSafe Charger</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Nomad</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2F\">Nomad</a> is the company with the most recent launch for <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fcollections%2Fiphone-12-cases\">set of MagSafe compatible iPhone cases</a>. It's selling versions of its existing \"Rugged\" branded cases, now all with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; included in every case.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iphone-12-magsafe-nomad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"840\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784283\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new cases are available for <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUVORUJGS0lMSkxCRkZOSE1L?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fcollections%2Fiphone-12-cases\">all four iPhone 12 models</a>, and include brown, black, and natural color variants. There's also two case styles: the Rugged Leather case or the Rugged Folio.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRugged Leather cases range in price from &#36;49.95 to &#36;59.95, while the Rugged Folio ranges in price from &#36;69.95 to &#36;79.95.
