Researchers have entered the loot box conversation in droves, as well, but a new report published by researchers on Friday seeks to answer a key question that it claims has been left untouched by other academics: <em>why</em> do gamers buy loot boxes?</p>\n<p>In trying to answer that question, the report, commissioned by gambling-protection advocacy group BeGambleAware, suggests that <a href=\"https://www.begambleaware.org/news/gambleaware-publishes-new-gaming-and-gambling-research\">loot box purchasing motivations are directly correlated with \"problem gambling\" behaviors</a>. That data drives the report's conclusion: regulators should apply the same rules to loot boxes that they do to other forms of gambling, because despite seeming differences, they have enough in common to merit stricter controls.</p>\n<h2>From Skinner boxes to <em>FIFA</em> cards</h2>\n<p>Much of the study, co-authored by four British universities and one private gambling-research firm, summarizes and describes both the history of loot box monetization and subsequent blowback, whether from fans, critics, or regulators. The report also outlines the amount of internal regulation done by game companies in response.
