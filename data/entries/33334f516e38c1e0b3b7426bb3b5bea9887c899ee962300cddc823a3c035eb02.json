There are some key differences between the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and the Beats Studio Buds that make them unique for different use cases, so we thought we'd compare them in our latest YouTube video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div><div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nDesign wise, Beats Studio Buds are smaller and more compact than the ‌AirPods Pro‌, but the design is similar because they offer silicone tips. Beats Studio Buds actually have a stemless design rumored for the next-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌, so in the future, the two sets of earbuds could be even more similar when it comes to overall look.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLike the ‌AirPods Pro‌, the Beats Studio Buds have Active Noise Cancellation with a Transparency mode. Fit always varies from person to person, but we found the ‌AirPods Pro‌ to be more comfortable with a more snug fit and a better seal. That said, the noise cancellation was about the same on the Beats Studio Buds and the ‌AirPods Pro‌. There's also very little difference in sound quality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBoth come with a charging case that functions in the same way, but the Beats Studio Buds case is more oval and slightly larger. As with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ case, the Studio Buds case offers additional battery life and you can get between 15 and 24 hours depending on how often you use ANC.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is one major difference that separates the Beats Studio Buds and the ‌AirPods Pro‌ and accounts for the price difference - there's no H1 chip. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ have an H1 chip that allows for useful features like cross-device switching.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe H1 chip is responsible for a lot of the \"magic\" that makes the ‌AirPods‌ and ‌AirPods Pro‌ just work with Apple's devices and it's also been included in prior Beats headphones, but with the Beats Studio Buds, Apple wanted a more platform agnostic experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple designed the Beats Studio Buds to appeal to both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Android users, rather than catering solely to ‌iPhone‌ users as with the ‌AirPods Pro‌. Apple has still built in quick pairing and Hey <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> activation, so Beats Studio Buds users aren't missing too many features. It's worth noting, though, that the Beats Studio Buds are also missing Spatial Audio support and ear detection.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been successful with its multi-platform approach. The Beats Studio Buds work well for ‌iPhone‌ users, and for Android users, the earbuds are the closest you're going to get to an AirPods-like experience on an Android device. At $149, they're cheaper than ‌AirPods Pro‌, and with their feature set, the Beats Studio Buds are well worth the cost.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats-studio-buds/\">Beats Studio Buds</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/08/beats-studio-buds-vs-airpods-pro/\">Beats Studio Buds vs. AirPods Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-studio-buds-vs-airpods-pro.2303638/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OqvaLBySxJc:YJpc0RKeJ-o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OqvaLBySxJc:YJpc0RKeJ-o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OqvaLBySxJc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"33334f516e38c1e0b3b7426bb3b5bea9887c899ee962300cddc823a3c035eb02","category":"Apple"}
