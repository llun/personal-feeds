The company currently operates 511 Apple stores globally, of which over 100 are in Europe.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's senior vice president of retail and people, Deirdre O'Brien, confirmed the intention to expand to Germany's <em>Funke Mediengruppe</em>:<blockquote>On our online site people can learn a lot about the products; in a store they can touch them and get a feel for them. We intend to add more stores.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile it is not yet clear if the expansion is set to be concentrated on a particular region, O'Brien's comments to the German publisher may suggest that Europe will be a focal point.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's newest store is Apple Via del Corso in Rome, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/apple-via-del-corso-retail-store/\">opened just last week</a>, and the company is also in the process of building its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/work-continues-apple-second-berlin-store/\">second store in Berlin</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMoreover, O'Brien remarked that Apple will \"undoubtedly\" add to its international design infrastructure, as seen with the company's plan to build a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/apple-new-munich-silicon-design-center/\">one-billion Euro chip design center in Munich</a> within the next three years.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/31/apple-to-add-more-stores-around-the-world-says-svp-of-retail/\">Apple to 'Add More Stores' Around the World, Says SVP of Retail</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-add-more-stores-around-the-world-says-svp-of-retail.2298600/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MqmPR_jah8c:YBhs0pguvKg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MqmPR_jah8c:YBhs0pguvKg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MqmPR_jah8c\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5cbeb2a1a7877d090afb92760d7197320a10ee002bb9737e9aa6b5b07dc00eef","category":"Apple"}
