For example, for a link to a podcast subscription that costs $10, the user would earn $5 in equivalent commissions. Apple says the payment scales globally based on the local market price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers who apply to the program are provided with a token that identifies their affiliate account when they publish a link to a paid-for podcast. This token aggregates all revenue generated through the user's affiliate links and pays out the commission earned  with 30 days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's wording suggests that the affiliate program is geared towards podcast creators, however anyone can sign up to it and generate revenue using affiliate links.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's existing affiliate programs cover content and subscriptions tied to the iTunes Store, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, and Apple Books.
