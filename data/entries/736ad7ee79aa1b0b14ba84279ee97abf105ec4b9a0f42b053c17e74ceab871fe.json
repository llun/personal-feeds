Here&#8217;s the gist on how you can apply:</p>\n<p>&#8220;At Kitsbow we strive to fit it all in; work, family, and fun. But when it feels like the adventure is something others do, it&#8217;s time to hit pause and get after the journey. Escape and adventure are just outside our door. The key is to go. Busyness can trap us and keep us from necessary escape.</p>\n<p>But, 36 Hours&#8230;now, that’s doable!</p>\n<p>Kitsbow is accepting 36 Hours in Kitsbow Grant Applications until Friday, March 19 at 5:00 p.m. ET.</p>\n<p>Want to learn more of the nitty-gritty details about the 36 Hours in Kitsbow Grant Program?
