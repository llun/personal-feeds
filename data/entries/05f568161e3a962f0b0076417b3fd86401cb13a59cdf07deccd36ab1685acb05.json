Lyft's main competitor, Uber, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/uber-sells-self-driving-project-to-startup-aurora/\">sold</a> its own self-driving unit to the well-financed startup Aurora back in December.</p>\n<p>Lyft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/21/16005636/lyft-self-driving-car-technology-hardware-software\">announced</a> its self-driving project back in 2017, a time of extreme optimism about self-driving technology. A few months earlier, in late 2016, Lyft President John Zimmer <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/18/12944506/lyft-self-driving-car-prediction-2021-john-zimmer\">predicted</a> that a majority of Lyft rides would be handled by self-driving vehicles by 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, that isn't going to happen. Today, Alphabet's Waymo is operating a small taxi service in the Phoenix area. Besides that, no one is operating fully driverless taxi services in the US, and most other companies aren't expected to introduce driverless products this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760718#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760718&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
