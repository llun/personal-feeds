But on Tuesday, VW's job might have gotten a little easier. That's because the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/two-days-with-a-volkswagen-id-4-heres-what-we-learned/\">new ID.4 crossover</a> just won this year's World Car of the Year award, beating two other finalists, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/dear-honda-this-adorable-electric-car-needs-to-come-to-the-us/\">the adorable Honda E</a> and the new Toyota Yaris. Fear not, E-fans: the diminutive electric hatchback won the World Urban Car category. Previous years' winners have included <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/04/the-kia-telluride-wins-the-2020-world-car-of-the-year-award/\">the Kia Telluride</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/the-jaguar-i-pace-wins-world-car-of-the-year-world-green-car-awards/\">the Jaguar I-Pace</a>.</p>\n<p>I expected the Honda E to win World Car Design of the Year; <a href=\"https://www.worldcarawards.com/web/juror_list.asp\">as one of the 93 jurors</a> around the world, I gave it high marks because <em>just look at it</em>. But more of my fellow jurors picked <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/the-land-rover-defender-rugged-charming-but-drinks-like-a-fish/\">the chunky Land Rover Defender</a> for that honor, and the Land Rover also beat the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/mazdas-electric-mx-30-goes-on-sale-in-the-us-this-fall/\">Mazda MX-30</a> in the process.</p>\n<p>The World Luxury Car award went to the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class, perhaps no surprise considering the other two finalists were the Defender and the Polestar 2. The Polestar is a fine EV with some very nifty tech, but it's no match for the bombastic Benz.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758975#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1758975&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
