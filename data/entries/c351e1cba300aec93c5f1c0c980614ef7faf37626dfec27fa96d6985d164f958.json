Obviously, it depends on the game. Few will complain that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mario-kart/\"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>'s Rainbow Road is unrealistic as they shoot red shells at a gorilla on wheels, but a boring street circuit with too many 90-degree turns that only exists to show off a NYC skyline is another matter.</p>\n<p>Done well, a made-up sequence of twists and turns can make a game; there's a reason we cheered so hard when we found out <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/grand-theft-auto-v-is-getting-expanded-and-enhanced-for-ps5-next-year/\">Trial Mountain will return with <em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a>. On the other hand, developers are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/forza-4-interview-turn-10-talks-ugc-strain-and-hints-at-tracks/\">constantly asked</a> about <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/forza-motorsport-5-revisited-ars-talks-to-turn-10/\">adding real-world racetracks</a> to their <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/10/a-trip-to-turn-10-the-forza-studio-merging-car-culture-with-games/\">games</a>. And the presence of a decently digitized Spa or Nürburgring Nordschleife may well tempt a wavering gamer into a purchase.</p>\n<p>It's the kind of thing I think about, which might just mean I'm a bit weird. But it also explains why I said \"yes\" when someone asked if I'd like to talk to Mike Muye, senior director of operations for Monster Energy Supercross, about this very topic. I agreed even though I don't really know much about Supercross, an evolution of motocross in which off-road motorcycles race each other on dirt tracks constructed specially for the occasion. (<em>Monster Energy Supercross 4</em> went on sale earlier this month for PC, Playstation, and Xbox platforms, hence the offer of a chat.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750679#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750679&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
