The ship was caught in a storm on March 23 while transiting the Suez Canal, where a combination of high winds and the ship's massive <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sail-area\">sail area</a> turned it diagonally. At that point, the <em>Ever Given</em> ran aground and completely blocked the 152-year-old canal, which is less than a meter deep in many places outside of a dredged navigation channel.</p>\n<p>The blockage—<a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/03/26/suez-canal-satellite-clues-on-a-stricken-cargo-ship/\">easily seen by space-based sensors</a>—then started holding up hundreds of other ships trying to transit between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752870#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752870&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
