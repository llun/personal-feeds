Here's an early prototype, seen testing at Weissach in Germany.

And this Macan, which is still a couple of years from being ready, is entirely electric. Unfortunately, the photos don't give too much away about this electric vehicle replacement to one of Porsche's biggest sellers; the prototypes are camouflaged, and that Safari-spec LED roof bar is presumably just there to help Porsche's engineers test around the clock. The four-element LED headlights are probably the real deal, though.</p>\n<p>Porsche first revealed that the Macan would go all-electric in early 2019. The car will use a new electric vehicle architecture called PPE (Premium Platform Electric), which Porsche is developing together with corporate sibling Audi. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/this-electric-fastback-is-the-next-audi-a6-e-tron-due-in-late-2022/\">Audi recently briefed us on one of its first PPE-derived EVs, the 2023 Audi A6 e-tron</a>, which uses an 800 V, 100 kWh battery pack and a motor for each axle, with a combined output of 350 kW (469 hp) and 800 Nm (590 lb-ft). Although Porsche isn't ready to share its own specs yet, the A6 e-tron offers a ballpark within which we can guesstimate.</p>\n<p>In its email, Porsche says that it has built 20 digital prototypes, with different departments conducting their own simulations. \"We regularly collate the data from the various departments and use it to build up a complete, virtual vehicle that is as detailed as possible,\" said Porsche's Dr. Andreas Huber, who manages the digital prototypes. The aerodynamicists were among the first to start modeling the EV Macan beginning in 2017.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763731#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763731&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
