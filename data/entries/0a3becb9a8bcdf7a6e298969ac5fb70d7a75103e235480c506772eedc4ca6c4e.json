{"title":"SRAM trickles AXS wireless down to GX Eagle","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/sram-trickles-axs-wireless-down-to-gx-eagle/","date":1616683184000,"content":"<p>Today SRAM has announced some bigs news for the mountain bike (and gravel) world with its third-tier GX Eagle 1&#215;12 groupset receiving an AXS (pronounced &#8216;access&#8217;) wireless option.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM’s eco-system of AXS wireless components has stood mostly unchanged since its introduction some two years ago, but now the company is making clear moves to bring the technology down to more accessible price points. The new GX Eagle AXS rear derailleur isn&#8217;t cheap at US$370 (battery not included), but it’s a whole lot more affordable than the pre-existing <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/02/sram-eagle-axs-drivetrain-rockshox-reverb-asx-dropper-post-wireless-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">X01 and XX1 AXS derailleurs</a> that sell for US$500 and US$700 respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new GX AXS hits its lower price through the use of cheaper (and heavier) materials. A GX AXS rear derailleur, which features a steel cage, is 472 grams, while an X01 version sits at 364 grams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting performance should remain comparable to SRAM’s more expensive offerings given the same <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/sram-eagle-12-speed-10-52t-cassette/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">improved derailleur geometry</a>, wireless protocol, servo motor, Lithium-Ion battery and even Type-3 roller bearing clutch all carry over. Rear derailleur battery life remains unchanged at a claimed 20+ hours, and the system retains its IPX7 waterproof rating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-506558\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-shifter.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The controller (shifter) looks effectively unchanged from the premium options. A single CR2023 battery powers it with a claimed longevity in the two-year range. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, the new GX AXS derailleurs feature the Overload Clutch which in the event of an impact will momentarily disengage the derailleur motor in order to protect the unit and derailleur hanger. In theory, this should make AXS more resilient to direct impact versus a mechanical derailleur (still, beware of the dreaded stick).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new AXS derailleur and controller (shifter) are designed to be a direct (and incredibly easy) fit for existing SRAM Eagle-equipped (12-speed) bikes. SRAM’s Eagle GX-level 12-speed chain, XD cassettes (10-50T or <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/sram-eagle-12-speed-10-52t-cassette/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10-52T</a>) and DUB cranks remain unchanged. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This announcement isn’t only relevant to mountain bikers, but also gravel riders wishing to adopt a wide-range 1x system, too. Much like the XX1 and X01 AXS rear derailleurs, the new GX AXS can be paired with AXS road shifters for a wide-range 1x setup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM will offer the new GX Eagle AXS as individual components or as a US$600 “upgrade kit” that includes the derailleur, controller, battery, charger and other small items needed to convert an existing SRAM Eagle-equipped bike to AXS wireless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-506559\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SRAM-GX-Eagle-AXS-Upgrade-kit.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The new GX Eagle AXS Upgrade Kit is about US$400 less than equivalent X01 Upgrade Kit.

This optional extra costs US$20.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn more about the new SRAM GX Eagle AXS product, including a full review, over at <a href=\"http://pinkbike.com\">pinkbike.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/sram-trickles-axs-wireless-down-to-gx-eagle/\">SRAM trickles AXS wireless down to GX Eagle</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0a3becb9a8bcdf7a6e298969ac5fb70d7a75103e235480c506772eedc4ca6c4e","category":"Cycling"}
