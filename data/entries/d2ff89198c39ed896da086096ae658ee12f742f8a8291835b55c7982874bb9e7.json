It’s 70Nm, if you’re interested.</p>\n<p>However, what is even more impressive is the potential range offered by the 500Wh battery pack. When using electric assistance at the lowest level, this gives you the potential to cover 220km before you have to pedal hard or find a socket to plug in and charge up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bassobikes.com/shop-en/bikes/e-bike/volta.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Basso Volta e-bike now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Even without the assist, riding the Volta won’t be much of a chore thanks to an all-in weight of just 16.5kg. While a lot of that svelte design is down to the carbon fibre frame and matching fork, the use of a SRAM Apex 1x drivetrain no doubt helps too.</p>\n<p>This is a bike whose design and specification have been carefully thought through to offer a great riding experience no matter what the terrain.</p>\n<p>This is further evidenced by the wheel and tyre selection. If you’ve ever watched the Tour de France you’ll have seen the name Mavic on the neutral service car, and the level of knowledge and experience a company needs to get that job is clearly reflected in the design of the lightweight MX 25 wheels.</p>\n<p>These use the latest bolt-through mounting to keep them secure while mounting disc brakes for the ultimate in safe stopping. Add a pair of large-volume 45c Maxxis Rambler TR tyres and the Volta is ready to roll over almost anything.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bassobikes.com/shop-en/bikes/e-bike/volta.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Basso Volta e-bike now</strong></em></a></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9374/tour-of-britain-2021-start-and-finish-destinations-announced\">Tour of Britain 2021 start and finish destinations announced</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/2305/womens-tour-route-riders-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Women's Tour 2021: Route, riders and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9198/ian-stannard-returns-to-professional-cycling\">Ian Stannard returns to professional cycling</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Basso Volta specs</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated weight:</td>\n<td>16.5kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame material</td>\n<td>3K Torayca HMCF T700-MR60 carbon fibre</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Motor</td>\n<td>Polini E-P3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td><span>Polini E-P3</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated range</td>\n<td>220km (137 miles)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Groupset</td>\n<td>SRAM Apex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>San Marco GND</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bars</td>\n<td>Microtech XL Gravel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>Mavic MX 25 700c</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyres</td>\n<td>Maxxis Rambler TR 700x45c</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.bassobikes.com\">bassobikes.com</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d2ff89198c39ed896da086096ae658ee12f742f8a8291835b55c7982874bb9e7","category":"Cycling"}
