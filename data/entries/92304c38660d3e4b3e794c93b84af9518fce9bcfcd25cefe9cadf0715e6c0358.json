The new wireless mesh service will share a small slice of your Internet bandwidth with nearby neighbors who don’t have connectivity and help you to their bandwidth when you don’t have a connection.</p>\n<p>By default, Amazon devices including Alexa, Echo, Ring, security cams, outdoor lights, motion sensors, and Tile trackers will enroll in the system. And since only a tiny fraction of people take the time to change default settings, that means millions of people will be co-opted into the program whether they know anything about it or not.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768704#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768704&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"92304c38660d3e4b3e794c93b84af9518fce9bcfcd25cefe9cadf0715e6c0358","category":"Tech"}
