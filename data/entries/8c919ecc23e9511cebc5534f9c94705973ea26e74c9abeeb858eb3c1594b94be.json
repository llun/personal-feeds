Enabling a language is done through the \"Keyboard\" section of the Settings app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAny supported language that is enabled as a Keyboard option will be listed under \"Scribble\" in the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; settings on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and that language will be available for use when writing, with special characters supported. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nScribble can be used across &zwnj;iPadOS 14&zwnj; for writing out iMessages, conducting Safari searches, looking for directions in Maps, creating Notes, scheduling Calendar events, and more. It comes with other features such as Smart Selection for copy/pasting handwritten notes, and there's built-in data detection that converts numbers and email addresses to make them tappable. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lg7tprc7KA8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#apple-pencil-scribble\">Feature Availability page</a> continues to list just English and Chinese as available Scribble options, but that should change when iPadOS 14.5 sees an official release in early spring.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are many other changes and feature additions that Apple is introducing in iPadOS 14.5, including support for the most recent gaming controllers, an Apple loading logo that's properly displayed horizontally when the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is in landscape mode, new emoji characters, and more, with everything new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everything-new-in-ios-14-5-beta/\">listed in our iOS 14.5 guide</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/ipados-14-5-scribble-language-support/\">iPadOS 14.5 Beta Adds Apple Pencil Scribble Support for German, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-14-5-beta-adds-apple-pencil-scribble-support-for-german-french-spanish-italian-and-portuguese.2285443/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qFOGAvgcQ44:tf8OEXJV5wI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qFOGAvgcQ44:tf8OEXJV5wI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qFOGAvgcQ44\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8c919ecc23e9511cebc5534f9c94705973ea26e74c9abeeb858eb3c1594b94be","category":"Apple"}
