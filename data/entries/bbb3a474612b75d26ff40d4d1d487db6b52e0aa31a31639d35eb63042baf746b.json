It&#8217;s been stuck there so long that other ships are starting to turn south around the horn of Africa. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our friends over at Pinkbike rang up some industry contacts to see if <a href=\"https://www.pinkbike.com/news/canyon--orange-comment-on-delays-caused-by-blocked-suez-canal.html\">any bike shipments currently sit on the deck of the Ever Given</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer? Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, one of our shipments is loaded on the “Ever Given” and there are several shipments blocked on vessels which cannot pass the Suez canal,&#8221; a representative of Canyon told Pinkbike. &#8220;This will cause a delayed ETD in Rotterdam and will lead to a bottleneck in the harbour. Currently they have no ships to unload.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole situation is making for some great memes, at least. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the full story, including a broader discussion of the industry&#8217;s current availability crisis, <a href=\"https://www.pinkbike.com/news/canyon--orange-comment-on-delays-caused-by-blocked-suez-canal.html\">head over to Pinkbike</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/the-big-stuck-ship-is-blocking-bikes-too/\">The big, stuck ship is blocking bikes, too</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"bbb3a474612b75d26ff40d4d1d487db6b52e0aa31a31639d35eb63042baf746b","category":"Cycling"}
