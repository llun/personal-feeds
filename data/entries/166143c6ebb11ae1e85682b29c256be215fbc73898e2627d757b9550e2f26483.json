{"title":"Gone Floating Labels And Green Lighthouse Scores","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/floating-labels-performance-lighthouse/","date":1616160600000,"content":"<p>There is always something happening behind the scenes at Smashing. Over the last months, we’ve been continuously working around <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/smashingmag-performance-case-study/\">the performance of the site</a>, but we’ve also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1367518953443106817\">removed floating labels</a> from our forms, redesigned our error messages, revamped our <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/\">Membership dashboard</a>, refactored and adjusted our responsive tables and worked with new authors on a bunch of new articles that will be published on the site over the next months. So, here’s your monthly Smashing update.</p>\n<h3>Floating Labels Are Gone</h3>\n<p>After we’ve published Adam Silver’s piece on why <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/material-design-text-fields/\">floating labels are a bad idea</a>, we’ve seen a huge discussion on Twitter and in the comments about them. Surely you can save quite a bit of vertical space with them, but the cost of it are plenty of <strong>accessibility and autofill issues</strong>. Ironically, at the moment of publishing that article in late February, we still had floating labels used in most of our forms, and we wanted to explore if removing them would actually help us improve the overall experience on the site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c0b87600-a204-403f-b87f-8a6fe2bc0a10/3-smashing-update-march2021.png\" /></p>\n<p>So we’ve <strong>removed the floating labels</strong> and redesigned input fields, placing the labels above the input field, just like Adam has suggested. We also used the opportunity to add some subtle adjustments to our actual forms, and we are still working on it. But the result looked better already.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5e817af5-a9e4-4596-a01b-827cad2f89ab/1-smashing-update-march2021.png\" /></p>\n<p>After a few days of refinements, we’ve stumbled upon styling issues with <strong>autofill</strong>. We wanted to adjust the font-size and the font used with autofill with the <strong><code>:-webkit-autofill</code> CSS</strong> <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes\">pseudo-class</a> — it matches when an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>  element has its value autofilled by the browser — but it’s not supported across a range of browsers, and frankly caused quite a bit of a hassle when an autofilled value is validated once the visitor leaves an input field.</p>\n<p>In fact, we had to look into various cases for the form design:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What happens when <strong>no data is provided</strong> at all?</li>\n<li>What happens when we <strong>retrieve the data from localStorage</strong> and plug it automatically in the input fields, but then autofill hasn’t been activated?</li>\n<li>What happens when <strong>some values are auto-filled</strong>, but others aren’t?</li>\n<li>What happens with <strong>inline validation</strong>, and when do we validate?</li>\n<li>What happens if some autofilled input fields have <strong>errors</strong>?</li>\n<li>How should the input values appear on <code>:active</code> and on <code>:focus</code>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Frankly, this turned out to be quite a rabbit hole, and we are still looking into all these issues at the moment. Given that a vast majority of our readers — wonderful people like you — are using autofill, it’s worth spending time designing an experience around it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0fb993f3-53dd-4806-b8ef-881e8a35f94b/2-smashing-update-march2021.png\" /></p>\n<p>After a bit of refinements, around 2 weeks after the initial article by Adam was published, we’ve <strong>pushed the changes live</strong>. We did manage to resolve plenty of accessibility issues and layout issues on mobile just by removing floating labels. But we can’t really say just yet whether it had any impact on the business metrics — well, we’ll need to wait for a big book release to see that.</p>\n<h3>Green Scores in Lighthouse on Mobile</h3>\n<p>Working around improving <strong>performance</strong> was an ongoing journey on SmashingMag for a while. In the end of last year we’ve noticed that we’ve seen quite a drop in performance in 2020, so we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. By <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/smashingmag-performance-case-study/\">changing the delivery of CSS and JavaScript</a> we landed in the green score area for most pages on the site in desktop view; yet the performance on <strong>mobile was still quite low</strong>, averaging between the Lighthouse scores of 60-70 for most articles.</p>\n<p>The final prompt for a more aggressive optimization was the <strong>“Core Web Vitals” dashboard</strong> in the Google Search Console. On February 19th, over 3590 articles were flagged with a poor CLS score (&gt;0.25) — on desktop and on mobile. We first thought that it could be related to the cookie banner adjustments we made recently, but it turned out it was a Google Search Update that seemed to be more aggressively penalizing us for a high CLS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d974619a-7970-4059-b3d2-8290a0e22efd/4-smashing-update-march2021.png\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9b6d9100-e6b9-4ba1-a5f8-8e668e07503f/5-smashing-update-march2021.png\" /></p>\n<p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1367781894327312388\">we’ve turned to Twitter</a> to ask the community if anybody had further suggestions around what we could do. The feedback was <em>fantastic</em> from people all over the world — with some thorough reviews submitted via Twiter’s DMs, and general thoughts by people on what we could do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patmeenan\">Patrick Meenan</a> has suggested to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patmeenan/status/1367849616457228294\">delay the service worker install</a>, which we implemented the same day. Apparently, the service worked was installing and activating before LCP and was causing contention.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gaelmetais\">Gael Metais</a> suggested to <strong>more aggressively subset web fonts</strong> and look into caching issues with our AVIF files. The next day we subset the fonts and pushed them live. We couldn’t fix the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/avif\">AVIF</a> issue quickly due to the way media management is running currently, but then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tunetheweb\">Barry Pollard</a> suggested to test if using base64-encoding for images would help.</p>\n<p>Base64-encoding seemed like a slightly odd concept in the world of HTTP/2, but we’ve decided to build a small prototype to test whether it helps. So, did it? Oh yes, it surely did.</p>\n<p>We were very surprised by early results. After a few iterations, we ended up serving our <strong>LCP author profile photos</strong> in a slightly convoluted but quite effective way:</p>\n <pre><code>&lt;picture&gt;\n  &lt;source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"data:image/avif;base64,AAA...\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"https://.../author.jpg\"\n    loading=\"eager\"\n    decoding=\"async\"\n    width=\"200\"\n    height=\"200\"\n    alt=\"\"&gt;\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If a browser supports AVIF, it gets a base64-encoded string of the AVIF image (no browser request).</li>\n<li>If a browser doesn’t support AVIF, it gets a JPEG file (properly cached),</li>\n<li>The content negotiation happens via <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> + <code>srcset</code> in the browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would be working only for the LCP author profile photos on the homepage and on article pages. At the moment, around <strong>35% of our mobile traffic is on iOS</strong>, so those users wouldn’t be getting the images faster, but encoding a large JPEG image only, or encoding both AVIF and JPEG files would unnecessarily bloat HTML which we wanted to avoid.</p>\n<p>We then adjusted our build to generate base64-strings for AVIF files automatically during the build time (if author images are available as AVIF images). That also makes it easy for us to remove it when we don’t need it any longer.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we removed duplicates and redundancies with the <a href=\"https://yellowlab.tools/result/fwhc79rb1p/rule/heavyFonts\">YellowLab.Tools</a>, refactored some CSS based on reports from <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-auditing-tools/\">CSS auditing tools</a>, and adjusted our browserslist config to <em>reduce</em> optimizations for IE10 and IE11.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/512cfdee-6def-4306-85c7-adf8d89757db/7-smashing-update-march2021.png\" /></p>\n<p>Overall we have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reduced the web fonts payload by 38%,</li>\n<li>reduced the size of critical CSS by 14%,</li>\n<li>reduced the size of JS files by 8%,</li>\n<li>(probably) increased the size of HTML by around 1%,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The impact was quite noticeable! For the first time in years, we’ve found our way to the green score zone of <strong>90–95 on mobile</strong>, while also making our rounds around <strong>96–100 on desktop</strong>. And that with a React application running in the background and plenty of scripting happening behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Still quite a bit of work to do, especially in the JavaScript world, but we seem to be on the right track — plus we are just about to implement <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW-5ML5hOZw7GczOargelPo6_8Zkuk2DXtgfOtJ59Eo/edit\">f-mods</a> with the kind and generous help of <a href=\"https://simonhearne.com/2021/layout-shifts-webfonts/\">Simon Hearne</a>.</p>\n<p>And the best bit: all the credit goes to the incredible <strong>community</strong>, and generous, passionate and kind folks who have been sending us suggestions and pointers via Twitter. And for that, we are very grateful — that’s the true strength and kindness of people in the community. Thank you! ❤️</p>\n<h3>New Article Series on Smashing</h3>\n<p>We were busy not only with performance and UX optimizations though. You probably visit the site because of the articles we publish, and so we’ve been experimenting with something new.</p>\n<p>In March, we started working on a <strong>new series of articles</strong> dedicated to tools and resources that can help you as a designer or developer get better at your work. You could see them as good old-fashioned round-ups, but we take time to prepare pieces with pointers that you can use every now and again <em>over time</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/67998e7d-f168-4b4e-9b3c-aea3c7bffe2b/2-css-generators.png\" /></p>\n<p>We’ve started out with tooling around CSS, but please expect more similar pieces around everything else front-end. We hope to keep you on your toes with them, so get ready! And here are the first articles we’ve published so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-auditing-tools/\">CSS Auditing Tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-generators/\">CSS Generators</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We've also been reaching out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1372118371651756037\">invite new authors</a> and smart folks like you to work on <strong>interesting case studies</strong> from your ongoing projects. So please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1372118371651756037\">reach out to us</a> if you’ve been working on an interesting and challenging project recently — be it around accessibility, CSS/JS, performance, migration, refactoring or pretty much anything else. No worries if you’ve never written before — we are here to help and guide you.</p>\n<p>Also, if you have released an <strong>open-source tool</strong> and would love to draw more attention to it, please let us know as well and we’d love to have you presenting your project here in the magazine as well.
