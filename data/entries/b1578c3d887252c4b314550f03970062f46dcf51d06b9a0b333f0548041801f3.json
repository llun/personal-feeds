This is the first significant deal we've seen on the 3D platformer, which only launched in February.</p>\n<p>For the unfamiliar, <em>Super Mario 3D World </em><em>+ Bowser's Fury</em> contains two separate games. The first is the latest in Nintendo's long line of excellent Wii U games it has touched up and re-released for the Switch's wider audience. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-everything-old-is-new-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our review notes</a>, it remains a charming and inventive platformer that straddles the line between the free-form movement of 3D <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/super-mario-bros/\">Mario</a> </em>games and the more linear level design of the series' 2D origins. It also supports drop-in, drop-out co-op with up to four players.</p>\n<p><em>Bowser's Fury</em>, meanwhile, is an all-new, roughly four-hour expansion of sorts that takes the feel of <em>3D World</em> and applies it to an open-world environment, wherein Mario can hop from island to island and complete different platforming challenges almost at will. While our review found it to get somewhat repetitive over time, the game is fresh and perhaps a peek at where the franchise may be headed going forward.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753690#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753690&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b1578c3d887252c4b314550f03970062f46dcf51d06b9a0b333f0548041801f3","category":"Tech"}
