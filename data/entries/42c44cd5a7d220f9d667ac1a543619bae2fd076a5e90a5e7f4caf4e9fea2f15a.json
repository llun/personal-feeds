According to <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11423746\">companies house</a>, his company, Alvit Consultancy, is registered at 253 Stafford Road, Caterham CR3 6NL.  His Linkedin profile (before he blocked it) showed him as working for the cloudbooking.com website. Maurice, a graduate of the University of the West of England, Bristol, along with Michelle appear to be frequent users of the extremist website 4chan. He is about 1.75m tall of lanky build and has classic male pattern baldness and ginger hair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Arthurs Brennan is a 31 year old cycling journalist, she has had previous experiences with flouting the law <a href=\"https://www.hambini.com/michelle-arthurs-brennan/\">here</a>.  Commentators on the post linked have claimed that Michelle is infertile and her feminist extremism is a cover up for her infertility. She herself has described her amenorrhea (failure to menstruate) as a result of her <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/cyclings-hidden-fuelling-epidemic-446422\">excessive training</a>. However gynecological experts have suggested Arthurs-Brennan has a body fat percentage that is too high and an underlying condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome exists. Some users that claim to know Michelle and Maurice have stated she has had multiple failed IVF treatments. She also claims to be an expert in bed and deems the exploits of <a href=\"https://www.hambini.com/michelle-arthurs-brennan/\">ham fisted amateurs</a> at massaging her clitoris to be equivalent to those of poor fitting bicycle saddles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"362\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mabs.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9399\" srcset=\"https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mabs.jpg 362w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mabs-170x300.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px\" /><figcaption>Michelle Arthurs-Brennan describing having her clitoris flicked</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-1024x682.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10057\" srcset=\"https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-1024x682.png 1024w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-600x400.png 600w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-300x200.png 300w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-768x512.png 768w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8-1536x1023.png 1536w, https://www.hambini.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png 1732w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Maurice Brennan, Pictured on the left</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Maurice Brennan purchased this Toyota GT86, a photograph of the car is shown below.

Studies have stated a low body fat percentage contributes to Amenorrhea. That limit is accepted to be 10%.
