The operating system will introduce improved texting and photo sharing, new HomeKit integrations, and some smaller updates to health and fitness features.</p>\n<p>The Apple Watch's Breathe app has been replaced by Mindfulness, which incorporates Breathe and Reflect activities. Breathing gets new animations while Reflect sends mindfulness prompts like, \"bring to mind a relationship you cherish and think about it,\" and an accompanying calming animation you can focus on as you reflect. There will also be a few new pointers in the app to help you focus and relax. You'll be able to set if or when you get such prompts throughout the day.</p>\n<p>In Fitness, Apple is adding two new workouts: Tai Chi and Pilates. Apple Fitness+ gets another set of workouts focused on HIIT (high-intensity interval training); the service will also include Artist Spotlights, which suggests music to play during your workouts.Â watchOS8 will also provide respiratory-rate tracking for sleep, but not for workouts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770191#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770191&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f66cf04c2ac474a9b77a8f767c78aab32d7d5eacca013488aa2dffcab84db05f","category":"Tech"}
