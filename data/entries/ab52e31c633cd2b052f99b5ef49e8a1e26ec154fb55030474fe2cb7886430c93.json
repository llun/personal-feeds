It’s important to do this before you get busy with the hosepipe or soapy water as this will only dilute the degreaser and reduce its effectiveness. Spinning through 30-40 pedal revolutions through the chain cleaner should be enough to get the chain sparkling clean.</p>\n<p>Use the remaining degreaser from the chain cleaner on a stiff brush to scrub the rest of the drivetrain. Long bristles are best to reach in between sprockets and between chainrings etc. Don’t worry about making everything really messy at this stage.</p>\n<h4><em>Top tip</em></h4>\n<p><em>The process of rinsing everything off once you're finished cleaning is another reason why it’s important to use a good quality water soluble degreaser (and not products like diesel or paraffin or Turpentine solutions etc which cannot be washed away)</em></p>\n<p>Focus on cleaning the sprockets and jockey wheels thoroughly.</p>\n<p>Now coat the bike in a generous amount of the general purpose bike cleaner spray (many of these exist on the market). Focus on the hard to clean areas, such as hubs and disc brake callipers (if you have them). Give it a little time to do its work and begin to break down grime (around 30 seconds to a minute)</p>\n<p>Now using the sponge and hot soapy water, begin to work systematically around the bike, starting from the top and working down.</p>\n<h4><em>Top tip</em></h4>\n<p><em>Buy high-quality sponges, not cheap ones, as poor quality sponges simply fall apart in no time. A good example is sponges for tile grouting, as these are much tougher and more resilient to tearing.</em></p>\n<p>Use specific brushes to help to scrub those hard to reach areas. A good example of this is the hubs, where a purpose designed brush can access the middle of the wheel, between spokes, and allow you to effortlessly clean around the hub shell and spokes, where dirt often gathers.</p>\n<p>Finish off by soaking the drivetrain in soapy water, to flush away as much of the degreaser as possible. Run the chain through the sponge a few times too. Note: If you’ve done a good job of cleaning your chain the sponge should be left quite clean, and <em>not</em> coated with black grime after this process.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9141/mens-worldtour-team-bikes-2021-a-breakdown\">Men&#039;s WorldTour team bikes 2021: a breakdown </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/9077/the-10-transfers-that-will-take-a-while-to-get-used-to-in-2021\">The 10 transfers that will take a while to get used to in 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9205/uci-bans-super-tuck-descending-position\">UCI bans &#039;super tuck&#039; descending position</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/reviews/7602/factor-o2-vam-review\">Factor O2 VAM review</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8431/chris-froomes-top-10-defining-moments-at-team-ineos\">Chris Froome&#039;s top 10 defining moments at Team Ineos</a></div>    </div></div><h4><em>Top tip</em></h4>\n<p><em>If you are short on time, focus on where the money is. By that I mean, focus on the moving parts that will cost you more to replace if left. A dirty drivetrain is a soon-to-be worn out drive train. It will save you a fortune in the long run if you keep these components clean, lubricated and well-maintained.</em></p>\n<p>The final step is the rinse, and this should only require the hosepipe on a low pressure. If you do not have a hosepipe, you can do this fine with a bucket of fresh water and the sponge, or even just a watering can will suffice.</p>\n<p>Be sure to dry the bike as much as possible, paying particular attention to the chain. Bouncing the bike on the ground lightly helps to shake water out of all the nooks and crannies.</p>\n<p>Now, go to our video on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vov7DZ7v22M\" target=\"_blank\">post-cleaning lubrication and protection</a> to find out what to do next. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/bicycle-maintenance\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Bicycle maintenance</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"sbowers","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"ab52e31c633cd2b052f99b5ef49e8a1e26ec154fb55030474fe2cb7886430c93","category":"Cycling"}
