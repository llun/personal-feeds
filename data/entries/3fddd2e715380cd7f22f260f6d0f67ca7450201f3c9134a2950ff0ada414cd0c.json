(credit: Ron Amadeo)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Here's a wild report from <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/\">Android Police</a>'s David Ruddock: Qualcomm is planning to build an Android-powered Nintendo Switch clone. This device would be a gaming-focused tablet with serious cooling and detachable side controllers. The Switch is powered by Nvidia's Tegra SoC and Nintendo's top-flight game designers, while this Qualcomm... game console (?) would be powered by a Snapdragon chip and run Play Store games. Qualcomm apparently plans to launch this thing in Q1 2022.</p>\n<p>According to the report, the device would attempt to \"showcase the company's Snapdragon chipsets in a less traditional form factor.\" This new form factor would be thicker than a normal smartphone and come with a 6000 mAh battery. Ruddock says that \"the company believes that the added thermal headroom a thicker design affords will make its processor run faster and significantly more efficiently than a modern ultra-thin smartphone.\"</p>\n<p>The report says Qualcomm is using \"a premium supplier\" to manufacture the Joy-Con-style controllers, and that, like a Switch, the device will support video-out for gaming on a TV. An SD slot will reportedly let you pack the device with games, and the system will run Android 12, Google's suite of apps, and a custom launcher. As a Qualcomm device, it will, of course, feature the latest 5G connectivity, but the report says, \"We do not believe any version of the console will function as a standalone mobile handset (i.e., have telephony features).\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751872#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751872&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3fddd2e715380cd7f22f260f6d0f67ca7450201f3c9134a2950ff0ada414cd0c","category":"Tech"}
