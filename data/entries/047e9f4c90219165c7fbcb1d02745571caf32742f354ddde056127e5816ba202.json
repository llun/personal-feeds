The new features and services will roll out in the coming days, weeks, and months.</p>\n<p>The first feature to arrive will be a new service called SignTime, which Apple says will launch tomorrow, May 20. SignTime will allow users to communicate with Apple's customer service representatives (either AppleCare or Retail Customer Care) using sign language. The service will launch first in the US, UK, and France with American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language, respectively. Further, customers at Apple Stores will be able to use SignTime to get in touch with an interpreter while shopping or getting customer support without having to make an appointment in advance.</p>\n<p>While SignTime's arrival is right around the corner, software updates loaded with new features aimed at making Apple's software and hardware more accessible for people with cognitive, mobility, hearing, and vision disabilities will hit Apple's platforms sometime later this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766111#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"047e9f4c90219165c7fbcb1d02745571caf32742f354ddde056127e5816ba202","category":"Tech"}
