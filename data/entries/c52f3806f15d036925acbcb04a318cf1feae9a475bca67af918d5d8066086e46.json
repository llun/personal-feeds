The Israeli company is the leading supplier of the chips, cameras, and software that power today's driver-assistance systems—a couple of years ago, Mobileye claimed 70 percent market share. The company is hoping to enjoy a similarly dominant position in the emerging market for fully self-driving systems.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Mobileye <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/mobileye-udelv-deal-autonomous-delivery/#gs.y1c7jr\">announced</a> that its self-driving technology stack would be branded Mobileye Drive. Mobileye says the technology will be \"a turn-key self-driving system ready for commercial deployment at scale.\" A Mobileye Drive system will have 13 cameras, three long-range lidars, six short-wave lidars, and six radars. It will be powered by Mobileye's EyeQ 5 processors.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-12-at-10.49.46-AM.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-12-at-10.49.46-AM-640x352.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-12-at-10.49.46-AM.png\"></a> (credit: Mobileye)</p></div>\n<p>Mobileye says the technology will be ready for commercial use by 2023. That would be a big deal if true, but I can't help being skeptical. Over the last five years, a number of major self-driving companies have announced optimistic launch dates and failed to meet them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756247#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
