Consumers can now choose between the original ad-free plan at $15 per month or the new, ad-supported plan at $10 per month—the breakdown is similar to Hulu (no ads) versus Hulu (with ads), at $12 per month and $6 per month, respectively.</p>\n<p>HBO Max customers (new or existing) can also prepay for additional savings. Paying upfront gets you a year of service for the cost of 10 months at the monthly rate—$150 per year for ad-free or $100 per year for ad-supported.</p>\n<p>The new ad-supported tier offers the same content as the ad-free tier, with the exception of Warner Brothers same-day premiere films. The ad-supported plans also do not offer resolution higher than 1080p or the ability to download content for offline viewing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769148#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769148&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"38c922cb86b5aa511dcf9821c5b725fc5e6f2790a04094b1ba3fb91e784463fe","category":"Tech"}
