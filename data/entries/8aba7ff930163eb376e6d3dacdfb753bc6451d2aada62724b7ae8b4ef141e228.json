Another change reportedly coming to the new ‌Mac mini‌ is a \"plexiglass-like\" top, which will sit above the aluminum enclosure.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/mac-mini-back2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nProser says he has \"heard\" that Apple is testing two-tone color options for the ‌Mac mini‌, similar to the newly released 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. Finally, Prosser says that the new ‌Mac mini‌ will feature the same magnetic power port that debuted in the 24-inch ‌iMac‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/mac-mini-ports.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple updated the ‌Mac mini‌ with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon chip in November, keeping in its lineup Mac minis equipped with Intel processors. <em>Bloomberg</em> has indicated Apple could scrap its plans to release this new high-end ‌Mac mini‌ but notes that regardless, it will eventually replace the current Intel models with ones featuring Apple silicon chips. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/high-end-mac-mini-renders/\">High-End Mac Mini Said to Feature Thinner Design With 'Plexiglass' Top, Magnetic Power Port</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/high-end-mac-mini-said-to-feature-thinner-design-with-plexiglass-top-magnetic-power-port.2297739/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qocM74AteFI:Pxi9tChsqAM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qocM74AteFI:Pxi9tChsqAM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qocM74AteFI\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8aba7ff930163eb376e6d3dacdfb753bc6451d2aada62724b7ae8b4ef141e228","category":"Apple"}
