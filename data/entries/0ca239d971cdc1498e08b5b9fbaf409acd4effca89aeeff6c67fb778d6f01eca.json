But instead of adding a VR mode to the upcoming <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/resident-evil-viii-gets-may-release-date-massive-preview-playable-demo/\"><em>Resident Evil VIII: Village</em></a>, slated to launch next month, the game maker threw horror fans a curveball. The project, as it turns out, is <em>Resident Evil 4 VR</em>, a wildly revised port of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/resident-evil-4-hd-updates-a-classic-with-semi-modern-graphics/\">the 2005 classic</a>, and it appears to be an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-we-do-not-recommend-the-299-oculus-quest-2-as-your-next-vr-system/\">Oculus Quest 2</a> exclusive.</p>\n<p>You read that correctly: Quest 2, as opposed to Rift or other PC-VR platforms. No release date or estimate has yet been confirmed.</p>\n<p>The VR port was announced as part of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NBKqjKcAeo\">the latest announcement frenzy otherwise dedicated to May 7th's <em>RE8</em></a>, and it confirmed that Oculus Studios and Armature Studios (made up of ex-<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/09/beautiful-corruption-a-review-of-metroid-prime-3/\"><em>Metroid Prime</em></a> developers) are leading the VR port's production. Because of Armature's recent ties to Oculus, in terms of releasing exclusive VR games for its Rift and Quest systems, that collaboration points to this game remaining an Oculus exclusive.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757320#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757320&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ca239d971cdc1498e08b5b9fbaf409acd4effca89aeeff6c67fb778d6f01eca","category":"Tech"}
