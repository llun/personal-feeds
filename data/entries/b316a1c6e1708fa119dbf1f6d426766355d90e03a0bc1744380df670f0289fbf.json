Priced at $29 each or $99 for a four pack, users can attach AirTags to personal belongings like a wallet, keys, purse, or backpack and then keep track of the location of those items in Apple's built-in Find My app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've already rounded up some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/airtag-unboxing-videos/\">AirTag unboxing videos</a>, and below we've gathered some more in-depth opinions from AirTag reviews. We'll be adding more, so keep refreshing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety\">The Verge's Dieter Bohn</a>:<blockquote>Really, the AirTag is the Most Apple Product I've seen in a while. It's just a little more expensive than the competition. It's beautifully designed, but its hardware still somehow fails to actually take the practical realities of our dirty, messy world into account. It's very privacy-focused. It really only works with Apple devices. It offers features that no third-party device can really match thanks to Apple's tight integration (or tight grip on its APIs, depending on your point of view). And since there's no Android version of Find My, it's another piece of the Apple ecosystem that's going to keep you from switching.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn AirTag is a very Apple-y thing for Apple users who already live in Apple's ecosystem. They work great — and will be great at keeping you in Apple's world.</blockquote><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/first-findings-with-apples-new-airtag-location-devices/\"><div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nTechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino</a>:<blockquote>In my very limited testing so far, AirTag location range fits in with that basic Bluetooth expectation. Which means that it can be foiled by a lot of obstructions or walls or an unflattering signal bounce. It often took 30 seconds or more to get an initial location from an AirTag in another room, for instance. Once the location was received, however, the instructions to locate the device seemed to update quickly and were extremely accurate down to a few inches.</blockquote>More impressions to follow.
