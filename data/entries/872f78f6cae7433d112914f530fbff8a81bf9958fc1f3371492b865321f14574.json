{"title":"Latest Chrome 88 Update Includes Important Fix for Zero-Day Vulnerability","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/chrome-88-includes-zero-day-exploit-fix/","date":1612519692000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/05/Google_Chrome_Material_Icon-450x450-250x250.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-450592\" />Google has released Chrome version 88.0.4324.150 with an important fix for a zero-day vulnerability in the web browser that the company <a href=\"https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_4.html\">says</a> is likely to have been exploited in the wild.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle hasn't provided specific details about the heap buffer overflow memory corruption bug known as CVE-2021-21148, and says it won't do so \"until a majority of users are updated with a fix.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, <em><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-patches-an-actively-exploited-chrome-zero-day/\">ZDNet</a></em> notes that the date on which Google says the bug was reported, January 24, is just two days after Google's Threat Analysis Group <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-north-korean-hackers-have-targeted-security-researchers-via-social-media/\">reported</a> a hacking campaign carried out by North Korean hackers against the cyber-security community.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSome of the attacks involved luring security researchers to a blog where the attackers exploited browser zero-days to run malware on the researchers' systems. On January 28, Microsoft also <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacks-against-security-researchers/\">reported</a> that attackers most likely used a Chrome zero-day for their attacks.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe proximity of the two events has led security researchers to suspect that it was indeed the CVE-2021-21148 zero-day that was used in the attacks. As a result, all users are being advised to use the Chrome menu bar's <strong>About Google Chrome</strong> option to upgrade their browser to the latest version as soon as possible. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle Chrome for Mac is a free download available directly from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/\">Google's servers</a>. <a href=\"http://appshopper.com/utilities/chrome\">Google Chrome</a> for iOS is a free download for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> available on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.
