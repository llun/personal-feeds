But with less than a minute to the peloton, their efforts appeared optimistic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeExchange, riding for Lucas Hamilton, held the break close and pulled the peloton into the base of the climb, around 25km to go. The Ineos Grenadiers took over, helped by Bora-Hansgrohe. The size of the main bunch slowly dwindled, as did the size of the breakaway. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primoz Roglic, in yellow, sat comfortably in 6th wheel, surrounded by teammates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birthday boy Simon Geschke (Cofidis), 35 today, hit out from the main peloton with 11.5km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead, the lead group dwindled to just three, Powless, Mäder, and Elissonde. Mäder appeared the most comfortable and proved it with 6.9 km to go with a sharp attack, dropping both of his companions. Powless slowly clawed his way back, and at 6.5km to the duo was together again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geschke was swept up by the peloton shortly after, leaving just the pair out front with a gap of 40 seconds at 5 km from the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astana hit the front of the peloton with numbers, but the tempo wasn&#8217;t hard enough to get rid of any of Roglic&#8217;s lieutenants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo&#8217;s George Bennett hit back, taking the front from Astana and pulling the peloton into a long line with 3km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mäder continued on, his gap down to 34 seconds, as Bennett swung off and his teammate Steven Kruijswijk took over, culling the group down to just 11 riders. Still present were Jai Hindley (DSM), Roglic, Hamilton, Schachmann and Astana&#8217;s Alexandre Vlasov.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kruijswijk&#8217;s work was done at 1.5 km to go and Roglic briefly hit the front, now isolated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the red kite, Mäder&#8217;s gap was down to just 17 seconds, chased the group of favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglic attacked, hands in the drops, and only Schachmann could respond. Roglic swung off, looking at Schachmann, and the pause looked like a gift to Mäder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglic wasn&#8217;t done though. He punched it again, passing Mäder in the final meters, making it his third stage win this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More to come.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/roglic-wins-paris-nice-stage-7-heartbreak-for-mader/\">Roglic wins Paris-Nice stage 7, heartbreak for Mäder</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"5ffde6abd7fb3b69e32eff1cf116ee52fa08f455dd8519e4d79b33c1fe8aa91f","category":"Cycling"}
