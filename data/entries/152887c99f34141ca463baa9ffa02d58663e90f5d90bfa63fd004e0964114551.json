However, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, and last yearâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> enjoyed dominance at the top of the list. \r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iphone-12-mini-counterpoint-jan-sales.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1486\" height=\"854\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-793274\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has widely been reported to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp//\">to have suffered from disappointing sales</a>, with Apple even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/iphone-12-mini-production-cut-report/\">reportedly cutting production</a> due to \"far lower\" than expected demand. The smaller handset includes the same features as the larger 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;, including the same camera system, chip, and overall design. The mini, however, includes a significantly smaller battery, and obviously, a less immersive display.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite its struggles, Apple is still reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-mini-expected-despite-12-sales/\">planning to keep the 5.4-inch form factor</a> alive in the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup. The newer handset, alongside the rest of the lineup, will likely benefit from improved battery life thanks to the power efficiency of the A15, which should address concerns from &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; customers about short battery life.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/09/iphone-12-mini-smartphone-list-for-january-2021/\">iPhone 12 Mini Missing From Top 5 Best Selling Smartphone List of January 2021</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-mini-missing-from-top-5-best-selling-smartphone-list-of-january-2021.2291167/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DmV0vyXesc4:NdqRd5PjrOY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DmV0vyXesc4:NdqRd5PjrOY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DmV0vyXesc4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"152887c99f34141ca463baa9ffa02d58663e90f5d90bfa63fd004e0964114551","category":"Apple"}
