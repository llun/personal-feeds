Built on the 10 nm SuperFin process, the new chips are in the Core i9, Core i7, Core i5, and Xeon families, and they carry the label \"Tiger Lake-H.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>New consumer laptop CPUs include the Core i9-11980HK, Core i9-11900H, and Core i7-11800H—all of which have eight cores—plus the Core i5-11400H and Core i5-11260H, which each have six cores.</p>\n<p>Naturally, Intel put the spotlight on the fastest Core i9-11980HK chip. The company claims this CPU is able to beat its predecessor by several percentage points in games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/hitman-iii-review-lets-call-it-hitman-2-5-and-be-fine-with-it/\"><em>Hitman 3</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/06/rainbow-six-siege-preview-strike-countered/\"><em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em></a>, depending on the game—anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent, according to Intel's own testing.</p>\n<p>Intel also says that the Core i9-11980HK beats AMD's Ryzen 9 5900HX by anywhere from 11 to 26 percent.
