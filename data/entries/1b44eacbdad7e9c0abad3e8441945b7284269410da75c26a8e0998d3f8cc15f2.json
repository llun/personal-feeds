One might be tempted to call it lavender, but to me it's a bit more like a lilac or maybe a wisteria. It lacks the redness you'd expect in a mauve or the blue tones you'd see in a violet. There are many shades of purple, but this one is what Apple went with and I like it. It's unmistakable even at a distance, whereas the light green ‌iPhone 12‌ models could be mistaken for off-white in certain light. I am also glad it doesn't have a fancy name. It's just \"purple.\"</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/apple-purple-iphone-12-hands-on/?europe=true&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29\"><em>Mashable</em>'s Brenda Stoylar</a> said that the new color is \"very pretty,\" and similarly noted that it is \"more of a periwinkle or a lavender\" than purple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/first-look-purple-apple-iphone-12-130035269.html\">Chris Velazco of <em>Engadget</em></a> also noticed the more subdued nature of the purple, but interestingly observed that it is \"roughly the same pastel shade that last year's purple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> came in.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple continues to sell the ‌iPhone 12‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a> in existing colors, including Black, White, Blue, Green, and (PRODUCT)RED.
