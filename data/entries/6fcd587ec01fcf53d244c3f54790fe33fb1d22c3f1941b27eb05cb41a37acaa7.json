That might seem just enough to get dubiously creative with your diction, but as <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394623/airtag-engraving-emoji-combination-horse-shit\">The Verge</a></em> points out, Apple puts pretty strict limitations on what you can emblematize on an AirTag.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor instance, a Pile of Poo emoji can't come after a Horse Face emoji, but other animal-poo combinations are fair game. Similar limitations apply to potentially offensive words spelt out with text, although some customers will surely find their own ways around the system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-engraving-no.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThis isn't the first time Apple has clipped the wings of would-be comedians and toilet humorists – many of the same emoji restrictions are present on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> engravings, for example. However, the ability to engrave several, more affordable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a> is likely to introduce more people to Apple's guarded funny side.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-engraving-emoji.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirTags‌‌‌‌ start at $29 each or $99 for a four-pack. Online orders open this Friday, April 23, with ‌‌‌‌AirTags‌‌‌‌ shipping April 30.
