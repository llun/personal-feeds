forefront of mountain biking, with the demands of long days on the pedals competing with long, technical descents that challenge downhill courses for their difficulty. </span></p>\n<p><span>As such, the latest breed of enduro bikes have to be happy spinning up hills as well as throwing themselves down steep chutes, through rock gardens and over huge gaps.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not all enduro bikes are born the same, though, and some will be better suited to epic days in the mountains, with pedalling characteristics to boot, while others are basically DH bikes in disguise – flat-out down the gnarliest of tracks, but possibly more of a slog back up the other side.</span></p>\n<p><span>We’ve also put together a buyer’s guide at the bottom of this article to help you choose the best enduro bike for you.</span></p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>The best enduro bikes in 2021, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><b><b>Trek Slash 8: </b></b>£3,450 / $4,200 / AU$6,300 /

As might be expected from such a high-spec bike, this new version of the Mega delivers a fast and lively ride thanks to its updated geometry and suspension.</p>\n<p>The revamped suspension brings 160mm of travel to the rear of the bike, thanks to a four-bar Horst link platform. This delivers a more dynamic ride compared to the previous version of Mega, with plenty of support too.</p>\n<p>The shorter chainstays and longer front end of the new geometry, paired with the updated suspension, gives the confidence to tackle rocky terrain and steeper sections.</p>\n<p>The spec is top class on the Mega but the tyres and saddle could be swapped off for a better ride. The saddle proved uncomfortable on longer climbs in testing and the tyres weren’t the fastest rolling.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/nukeproof-mega-290-carbon-rs-review/\">Read our full review of the Nukeproof Mega 290 Carbon RS</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2><span>Orbea Rallon M10 MYO</span></h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rallon is marketed as a no-compromise, full-gas enduro bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£5,027 (custom build price) as tested</li>\n<li><span>Rapid and lively enough on mellow terrain, capable on big hits too</span></li>\n<li><span>Good value kit that’s customisable at the point of purchase</span></li>\n<li><span>MYO programme allows custom paint job at no extra cost</span></li>\n</ul><p><span>The Rallon is Orbea’s EWS level enduro bike, ready to take on some seriously chunky terrain.

But this makes a lot of sense when you know it’s been designed around a downhill geometry that helps take on big hits and provides a stable ride.</p>\n<p>As could be expected from a bike with a more gravity-orientated geometry, the Dreadnought can take a lot of abuse on descents, but despite its high pivot is relatively lively, letting you manual, pump and jump without absorbing too much energy.</p>\n<p>When it comes to climbing there is plenty of bike to get uphill, but the high-pivot drivetrain doesn’t create as much drag as you might expect and – as long as your technique is good – there is a lot of grip to be found.</p>\n<p>The particularly long chainstay length gives the Dreadnought its stability and makes it ideal for taller riders.

The 200mm rotors and Code RSC brakes provide the stopping power.</p>\n<p>The suspension still offers 170mm of travel at the back (which is matched by 170mm at the front), but Santa Cruz has updated the pivot design to make the bike better at handling particularly rough descents.</p>\n<p>The Nomad wasn’t designed to be the fastest uphill, but it still holds its own and feels efficient.</p>\n<p>On steep descents, the Nomad handles will with the suspension remaining sensitive and keeping the tyres glued to the trail.

It’s a bit chicken and egg, but the race genre and the bike genre have pushed each other’s limits, and driven development of bike tech far beyond the confines of the course tapes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> MBUK’s Ed Thomsett drifts one of San Remo’s many loose, dusty turns on the AM9.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Wragg/Mountain Biking UK</i></span></div>\n<p>Enduro bikes sit in the middle-ground between downhill bikes and trail bikes. Like a DH bike they are designed to get down hills as fast as possible, tackling chunky rock gardens, matted root beds, big drops and canyon-like gaps, doing it all with a little less suspension travel.</p>\n<p>However, like a trail bike, they’re also designed to be pedalled back up; so rather than pushing to the top of the track, they can be ridden up thanks to more suitable geometry, wider gear ranges and lighter builds than a DH bike.</p>\n<p>As such, they’re slightly less capable downhill than a DH bike, but far more capable up, and more capable down but less capable up than a trail bike… got it?!</p>\n<h2>How much travel does an enduro bike have?</h2>\n<p>While there’s no set definition of travel that defines an enduro bike, the majority have between 150 to 170mm of suspension front and rear.</p>\n<p>Some 27.5in wheel enduro bikes may push travel a touch higher and there are a few with a little less at the rear – usually 29in bikes.</p>\n<p>Expect to see the burliest single crown suspension forks a brand has to offer with stanchion diameters varying from 35mm to 38mm. They’re built to be stiff, smooth and supportive, with higher-end models sporting plenty of adjustability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Fox 38 is hard to tell apart from the revised 36, even up close.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Rear shocks, especially when you’re buying bikes from the mid-range and up, will have a ‘piggyback’ design. This is an additional chamber connected to one end of the shock that allows for additional oil flow through the shock.</p>\n<p>This, then, allows for better temperature management and more consistency on long descents (you’ll be surprised by how warm a shock can get in use!).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Manitou’s Mara rear shock has the additional piggyback.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>How the bikes use that suspension travel will vary too. Some bikes have incredibly plush suspension that totally insulates you from the trail, leading to an incredibly planted feel that’s fast on steep and rough terrain. But with all that smoothness comes more pedal-induced movement, so these bikes can often feel sluggish on climbs and flatter tracks – you’ll be reaching for a lockout lever much sooner!</p>\n<p>However, some bikes will have a more pedal-friendly suspension, which will make the uphills much easier and the flatter tracks more fun. You may lose some of that buttery feeling when you’re going flat-out over rocks and roots, though.</p>\n<h2>Enduro bike geometry – what’s that about?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long and slack geometry helps to boost confidence in tricky terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dan Milner/MBUK</i></span></div>\n<p>The latest enduro bikes have long, low and slack geometry. This means long front centres (and reach measurements), slack head angles and low bottom brackets. This makes them super confident on steep hillsides because there’s less chance of you flipping over the handlebars, and it helps you better manage weight and grip between the tyres.</p>\n<p>Longer geometry can make the bikes a little slower to react to inputs, and sometimes you may find you need to re-address your riding technique to get the most agility out of them, but these bikes have descending speed at the forefront of their design.</p>\n<h2>How much should I spend on an enduro bike?</h2>\n<p>Enduro bikes do tend to be relatively pricey, unfortunately. That’s often because they require burlier components, which tend to be more expensive – think forks, wheels, tyres and brakes.</p>\n<p>One of the cheapest we’ve seen is the Calibre Sentry at £2,000 (see above). It’s an absolute steal at that price, but, as a general rule, most enduro bike ranges start north of £3,000.</p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"97dccae83ced23b1a7a0b9a144428913e4ead49eea298b0ba3a6ec828e3a88f3","category":"Cycling"}
