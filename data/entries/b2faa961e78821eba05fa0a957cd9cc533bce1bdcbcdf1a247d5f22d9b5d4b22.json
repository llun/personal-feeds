I’ve <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/the-mac-needs-shortcuts/\">written elsewhere</a> about this,\nbut essentially it’s easier for me to create automations for many\ntasks on iOS than it is on macOS — and it shouldn’t be that way.\nShortcuts fulfills the promise of Automator in ways that Automator\nnever did, and while it’s got a lot of room to grow, it’s clearly\nthe future of automation on Apple’s platforms. Add in actions that\ncan run AppleScript, Automator workflows, and shell scripts, and\nwe’ll really have something.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve gotten more into Shortcuts in the last few months, and I really hope this happens. I just wonder how Shortcuts on Mac could offer actions for things that aren’t possible on iOS, like Snell’s suggestion for being able to run AppleScript and shell scripts. I suppose they’d just generate an error on iOS, and you could use them in a cross-platform shortcut by conditionally testing whether the shortcut is running on MacOS — pretty much how it works now when you have a shortcut containing actions that require a third-party app to be installed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/02/snell-shortcuts-mac\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b2faa961e78821eba05fa0a957cd9cc533bce1bdcbcdf1a247d5f22d9b5d4b22","category":"Tech"}
