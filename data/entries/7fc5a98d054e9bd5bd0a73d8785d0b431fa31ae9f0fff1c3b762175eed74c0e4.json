If a finger that was enrolled on a built-in Mac Touch ID sensor is presented on a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, the Secure Enclave in the Mac successfully processes the match—and vice versa.</blockquote>This compatibility means that, from a technical standpoint, there is nothing stopping Apple from selling the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID on a standalone basis. As we previously reported, the new Magic Keyboard is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/magic-keyboard-touch-id-compatible-all-m1-macs/\">fully compatible with all M1 Macs</a>, but Apple is currently only offering the keyboard with the new iMac unveiled last month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has made some previously iMac-exclusive accessories available to purchase separately at a later date in the past. When the iMac Pro launched in December 2017, for example, Space Gray versions of the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad were only available with the iMac Pro, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/27/apple-selling-space-gray-magic-keyboard/\">became available separately in March 2018</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe updated guide also reveals that the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID can be securely paired with only one Mac at a time, but a Mac can maintain secure pairings with up to five\r\n<br />\r\ndifferent Magic Keyboard with Touch ID keyboards.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo enroll a new fingerprint, the user must physically confirm their intent to use a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID with the Mac, according to Apple. Physical intent is confirmed by pressing twice on the Mac power button when indicated by the user interface, or by successfully matching a fingerprint that had previously been enrolled with the Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for unlocking an iPhone with an Apple Watch on iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4 or later, the following criteria must be met, according to Apple:<blockquote>• iPhone must have been unlocked using another method at least once after the\r\n<br />\r\nassociated Apple Watch was placed on wrist and unlocked.\r\n<br />\r\n• Sensors must be able to detect that the nose and mouth are covered.\r\n<br />\r\n• Distance measured must be 2–3 meters or less\r\n<br />\r\n• Apple Watch must not be in bedtime mode.\r\n<br />\r\n• Apple Watch or iPhone must have been unlocked recently, or Apple Watch must have\r\n<br />\r\nexperienced physical motion indicating that the wearer is active (for example, not\r\n<br />\r\nasleep).\r\n<br />\r\n• iPhone must have been unlocked at least once in the past 6.5 hours.\r\n<br />\r\n• iPhone must be in a state where Face ID is allowed to perform a device unlock.</blockquote>The updated Platform Security Guide is <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/security/welcome/web\">available on Apple's website</a>, with a document revision history included on page 214.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-keyboard/\">Magic Keyboard</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/magic-keyboard-touch-id-compatibility/\">Apple Confirms Magic Keyboard With Touch ID is Compatible With a MacBook's Touch ID Sensor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-is-compatible-with-a-macbooks-touch-id-sensor.2296504/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=keP0pVpl2hw:qDgSpMBh91w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=keP0pVpl2hw:qDgSpMBh91w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/keP0pVpl2hw\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fc5a98d054e9bd5bd0a73d8785d0b431fa31ae9f0fff1c3b762175eed74c0e4","category":"Apple"}
