Thirty-two seconds later, Greg Van Avermaet (AG2R Citroën) out-sprinted Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo) to nab the final spot on the podium. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Poel and Asgreen formed part of an elite lead group that hit the Kruisberg together in the last 27 km, and they got clear with Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) on the cobbled climb. A big surge from Van der Poel on the Oude Kwaremont then dropped Van Aert, and from there, Van der Poel and Asgreen worked well together on the run-in to Oudenaarde, where things came down to a sprint. Van der Poel led out the sprint but Asgreen surged past with a hundred meters to go to claim his first Monument victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>***Copyrighted material is used under Fair Use and therefore this video is NOT MONETISED.
