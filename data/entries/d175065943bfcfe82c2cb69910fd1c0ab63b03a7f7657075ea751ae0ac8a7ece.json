Users can then find those devices, including those detected by any other Apple devices nearby.</p>\n<p>The new devices play off Apple's work in bringing augmented reality features to its devices. Users will be able to lift their phone cameras and see the locations of their AirTags positioned accurately in real physical space on the screen, using the U1 ultra-wide band chip Apple introduced to iPhones somewhat recently. Like some other similar products, AirTags will also be able to emit a noise to make them easier to find.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1685092#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1685092&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d175065943bfcfe82c2cb69910fd1c0ab63b03a7f7657075ea751ae0ac8a7ece","category":"Tech"}
