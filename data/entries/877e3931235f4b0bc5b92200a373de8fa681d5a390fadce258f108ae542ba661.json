Offering Turner networks outside of a cable bundle could anger pay-TV distributors, and Apple was concerned about annoying existing media partners.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere were also fears that either Apple or Time Warner could eventually back out of the exclusive partnership, which could be disastrous to their future relationships. Because of this, Cook, Cue, and Bewkes briefly discussed an Apple acquisition of Time Warner.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCue \"expressed interest\" in a full acquisition of Time Warner, but Cook was not ready to agree to the deal, which would have been somewhere around $100 billion. Neither Cook nor Bewkes expected to reach an acquisition deal, and Time Warner was ultimately sold to AT&amp;T.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nToday, AT&amp;T has combined WarnerMedia with Discovery (pending regulatory approval), and the deal was structured in a way that allows the WarnerMedia-Discovery company to be sold down the road. <em>CNBC</em> suggests that Apple is one of the few companies that could afford to purchase WarnerMedia-Discovery.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince its 2015 talks with Time Warner, Apple has gone on to establish its own catalog of original content and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> streaming service, though a major acquisition like WarnerMedia would give it the content that it needs to compete with other companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/time-warner/\">Time Warner</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/2015-acquisition-talks-apple-time-warner/\">CNBC Details 2015 Acquisition Talks Between Apple and Time Warner</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cnbc-details-2015-acquisition-talks-between-apple-and-time-warner.2297801/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=11q4aE8syR0:ZvEglBj8z-I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=11q4aE8syR0:ZvEglBj8z-I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/11q4aE8syR0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"877e3931235f4b0bc5b92200a373de8fa681d5a390fadce258f108ae542ba661","category":"Apple"}
