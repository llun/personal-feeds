A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0833-x\">study</a> by researchers at Princeton University in March 2020 found that Facebook is by far the worst social media platform for spreading dubious news content, compared to Twitter and Google. <div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/facebook-tests-contextual-labels-posts/\">Facebook Tests New Contextual &#039;Labels&#039; for Posts From Popular Pages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-tests-new-contextual-labels-for-posts-from-popular-pages.2291032/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ItEo9RgnoVg:-PH_KeaQ2OE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ItEo9RgnoVg:-PH_KeaQ2OE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ItEo9RgnoVg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db20a8baa541bee88e75ee818319160c95064e5b1ae09d4270b4ce7658efab13","category":"Apple"}
