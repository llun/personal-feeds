One recent survey <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/03/09/apple-idfa-survey-385-will-allow-mobile-apps-to-track-them-in-ios-14-and-google-is-the-most-trusted-big-tech-company/?sh=5dded3122f99\">found</a> that only about 38.5 percent of users plan to opt in to tracking.</p>\n<p>Most of the paper is dedicated to explaining exactly how apps track users to begin with, by using a hypothetical example of a father and daughter traveling to the playground with their personal mobile technology and apps in tow. There are no new revelations in this section for people who are already familiar with how these systems work, but the information is accurate, and most people don't actually know all that much about how their data is tracked and used, so it might be useful to some.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755111#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755111&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"984196a7474adb32c545854325df07623f07c171d541491003889217f354e980","category":"Tech"}
