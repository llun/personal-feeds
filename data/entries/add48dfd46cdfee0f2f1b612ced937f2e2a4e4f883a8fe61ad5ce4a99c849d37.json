The company, founded by <em>Survivor </em>winner Earl Cole and blockchain engineer Brian Yennie, promises 'no leaks, tears, punctures or messy sealants'.</p>\n<div id=\"file-44045\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/03/1smartpark.jpg?itok=ri9XErM0\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Dr Santo Padula, one of the inventors from NASA's Glenn Research Centre that worked alongside SMART to translate the technology into a public product, says, 'Shape memory allows look extremely promising in revolutionising the entire terrestrial tyre industry and that's just the tip of the iceberg.'</p>\n<p>While the successful introduction of these tyres would completely change the cycling industry – and SMART insists that they increase traction and safety across road, gravel and mountain bikes – arguably the best part about Metl tyres is the reduction in rubber waste.</p>\n<p>Over a billion tyres are discarded every year, albeit mostly from motor vehicles – SMART is developing in that area too – and tyre recycling technology isn't moving fast enough to fix that.</p>\n<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature put out <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/news/secretariat/201702/invisible-plastic-particles-textiles-and-tyres-major-source-ocean-pollution-%E2%80%93-iucn-study\" target=\"_blank\">a report in 2017</a> that said tyres may account for up to 28% of microplastic waste in the sea of which it estimated there was 9.5 million tonnes.</p>\n<p>Eliminating the use of rubber tyres would drastically reduce the pollutants we put into the ocean.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/1015/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2021: Route, start list and all you need to know</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/1080/a-day-on-the-paris-roubaix-cobbles\">A day on the Paris-Roubaix cobbles</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/2252/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2021: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 111: on sale now!</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/8800/paris-roubaix-has-been-cancelled\">Paris-Roubaix cancelled for the first time since 1942</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTo replicate the grip that rubber provides, Metl tyres are coated in Polyuerthanium, a rubber-like material that SMART says provides 'the longest-lasting tread and grip, for all weather conditions'.</p>\n<p>SMART, which has partnered with Felt, says the tyres will be available from early 2022. For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.smarttirecompany.com/\" target=\"_blank\">smarttirecompany.com</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/tyres\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Tyres</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"add48dfd46cdfee0f2f1b612ced937f2e2a4e4f883a8fe61ad5ce4a99c849d37","category":"Cycling"}
