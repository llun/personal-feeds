A disease colloquially referred to as The Sick spreads rapidly among humans while overwhelming infrastructure, grinding daily life to a halt, and racking up a body count. When this story begins, society tries to put itself together again. An unnamed narrator calls it \"The Great Crumble.\"</p>\n<p>This disaster, however, can't be contained even to the extent of COVID-19. No cure or vaccination has been discovered, so most humans opt to live in isolation either as individuals or as disease-free groups. This withdrawal has allowed nature to essentially step into the void—animals previously only seen in a zoo roam free, and landscapes grow out in full to replenish what society previously destroyed for resources.</p>\n<p>Oh, and in <em>Sweet Tooth, </em>the next generation of kids appears to include half-animal/half-human individuals called Hybrids. The ratio of column A to column B varies—some talk, some don't; many look like traditional kids with small animal features; all retain abilities like heightened hearing or smell—but no one seems to know anything for sure<em>. </em>Why did this evolution happen? How many are there? And, most pertinent, what makes Hybrids immune to The Sick? In the face of all that mystery, some portions of this new world look at Hybrids as a hopeful evolution of humanity, a group of individuals society should protect and help thrive. Others, though, see Hybrids as a hindrance to humanity getting past The Sick and returning to normalcy. In particular, Hybrids' immunity to The Sick has swaths of this new world curious about whether their DNA can be harvested for treatment or prevention.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774575#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774575&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c50513d57916d13f596da6a503b2a11d1d4c25cd4894fc938ee95d790233528","category":"Tech"}
