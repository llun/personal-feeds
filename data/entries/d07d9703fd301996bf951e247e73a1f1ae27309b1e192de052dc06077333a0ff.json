This proposal, however, will also have wide-ranging implications for athletes looking to stretch their lower backs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics have been quick to note that under a strict reading of the proposed rule, the standard victory salute – most commonly occurring <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/primoz-roglic-wins-liege-bastogne-liege-as-alaphilippe-celebrates-too-early/\">when a rider crosses the finish line first</a> –&nbsp;is an endangered species. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Posting up&#8221;, as the riders call it, has been a popular practice for professionals for decades, with the first recorded victory salute infamously <a href=\"http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/images-all/photo-galleries-images/racers-images/petit-breton-lucien/1908-TDF-il-vincitore.jpg\">taking place at the 1908 Tour de France</a>. In the years since there have been many more iconic,&nbsp;and increasingly elaborate, celebrations from riders including Peter Sagan, Toms Skujins, and Mathieu van der Poel. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Peter Sagan&#039;s first Oscar nomination\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s0yQ396Qwc0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Amgen stage 3 2018\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdqtuBZNeVE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses from within the peloton to the proposed measures are, at this early stage, mixed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of riders have taken to Twitter to express their gratitude for the UCI&#8217;s advocacy for their safety: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1173\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hugecarthy-tweets.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-509295\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hugecarthy-tweets.png 1173w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hugecarthy-tweets-650x242.png 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hugecarthy-tweets-190x71.png 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hugecarthy-tweets-1080x401.png 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hugecarthy-tweets-16x6.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1173px) 100vw, 1173px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few more traditionally-minded figures in the sport are viewing it as further overregulation – especially when lower-hanging fruit like the presence of disc brakes, ankle-socks and manly embraces remain rife within the sport. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1139\" height=\"309\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pat-lef.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-509744\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pat-lef.png 1139w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pat-lef-650x176.png 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pat-lef-190x52.png 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pat-lef-1080x293.png 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pat-lef-16x4.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>CyclingTips has contacted the CPA (Cyclistes Professionelles Associés) for comment, but it was unable to provide any meaningful statement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI guidelines in their proposed form can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/uci-mulls-more-safety-measures-including-a-ban-on-victory-celebrations/\">UCI mulls more safety measures, including a ban on victory celebrations</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"d07d9703fd301996bf951e247e73a1f1ae27309b1e192de052dc06077333a0ff","category":"Cycling"}
