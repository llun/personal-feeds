If you wind up with an AirTag from someone else that says it's linked to their ID but they've already removed it from their account, follow these steps to physically reset the AirTag:\r\n<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Press down on the stainless steel backing of the AirTag.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>As you press down, rotate counterclockwise until the cover stops rotating. <img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-battery-twist-open.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Pull apart the two halves of the AirTag. <img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-battery-pry-apart.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Take out the battery.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Put the battery back in.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Press down on the battery until it makes a sound.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Once the sound finishes, repeat this process four more times, removing and replacing the battery and then pressing on the battery until you hear a sound. <img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-battery-removed.jpg\" /></li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>You need to hear a total of five sounds to ensure that the AirTag is reset.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>After you've finished this process, put the cover on the AirTag back on and then align the three tabs on the cover with the three slots on the AirTag.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Press down on the cover until there's a sound, and rotate the cover clockwise until it locks in place.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ol>\r\n<br />\r\nTo avoid having to do this tedious physical resetting process, it's best to make sure that the person giving you an AirTag has removed it from their account in the proper way while it's in range of Bluetooth, because that's a far easier process for clearing AirTag ownership to pass it along to someone else.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/reset-airtag/\">How to Factory Reset an AirTag So Someone Else Can Use It</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-factory-reset-an-airtag-so-someone-else-can-use-it.2294848/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JVLU7EYqKJ0:Ghws14FMeNI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JVLU7EYqKJ0:Ghws14FMeNI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JVLU7EYqKJ0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e60430e5138222795065944f3b9dc183be4cc1d77bc6c4223342a1b4de3f42c6","category":"Apple"}
