The machine is still available in Europe and Asia-Pacific, for example, with two to three week shipping estimates.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThough the &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; may not yet be gone at this point, the unavailable status confirms that there are not a limited number of the machines available for purchase, so those who want to pick one up before they're discontinued should do so soon. Apple is selling the &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; for &#36;4,999. It includes a 3.0GHz 10-core Xeon Intel W processor, 32GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; was first released in December 2017 and has not received any significant updates since its debut. Apple recommends that people interested in a powerful desktop machine choose the 27-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> that was introduced in August, or the 2019 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is rumored to be working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">redesigned version of the iMac</a> with slimmer bezels and a design similar to the Pro Display XDR, plus an Apple silicon chip, with that machine set to be introduced sometime in 2021. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac-pro/\">iMac Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac_Pro\">iMac Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/imac-pro-unavailable-us-canada/\">iMac Pro Now Listed as &#039;Currently Unavailable&#039; in U.S. and Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imac-pro-now-listed-as-currently-unavailable-in-u-s-and-canada.2287586/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XgNPhRnJbP4:Fd6ljHM-rlk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XgNPhRnJbP4:Fd6ljHM-rlk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XgNPhRnJbP4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d79ca4af79993ed73f6ea629e45bc94397715924d840bba9eeb8787ce06832d1","category":"Apple"}
