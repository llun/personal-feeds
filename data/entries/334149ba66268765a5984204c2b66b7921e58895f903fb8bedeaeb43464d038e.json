The channel can bridge processes running as different users and under different privilege levels. These characteristics allow for the apps to exchange data in a way that can't be detected—or at least without specialized equipment.</p>\n<h2>Technically, it’s a vulnerability but...</h2>\n<p>Martin said that the flaw is mainly harmless because it can't be used to infect a Mac and it can't be used by exploits or malware to steal or tamper with data stored on a machine. Rather, the flaw can be abused only by two or more malicious apps that have already been installed on a Mac through means unrelated to the M1 flaw.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768316#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768316&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"334149ba66268765a5984204c2b66b7921e58895f903fb8bedeaeb43464d038e","category":"Tech"}
