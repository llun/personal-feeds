The current 27-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; configured with a 10-core Core i9 processor is faster and more affordable than the standard &zwnj;iMac Pro&zwnj; with a 10-core Xeon W processor was. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is also working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/\">a redesigned iMac</a> that will feature slimmer bezels, a Pro Display XDR-style design, and Apple silicon chips, so those who are seeking a powerful desktop machine may want to wait until the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models come out later this year before making a purchase.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/imac-pro-officially-discontinued/\">iMac Pro Officially Discontinued, Removed From Apple&#039;s Site and No Longer Available for Purchase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imac-pro-officially-discontinued-removed-from-apples-site-and-no-longer-available-for-purchase.2288940/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Hbv1CydFlrE:ocg69BX7tNQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Hbv1CydFlrE:ocg69BX7tNQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Hbv1CydFlrE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fd30c9e55c079f3856e168dd4c90c972a0a3e22ebcdca9cc256d34253d3343e8","category":"Apple"}
