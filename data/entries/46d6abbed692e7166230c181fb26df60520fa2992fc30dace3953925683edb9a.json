He underwent a cardiac ablation on Wednesday at Brussels hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has been cleared to get back to training this weekend, but will not race the Tour of Flanders and will instead spend some time off with his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am obviously disappointed to miss De Ronde on Sunday,&#8221; Stybar said. &#8220;I have been watching the build-up and excitement on the television and the feel and the passion for this period of racing, with E3, Gent-Wevelgem, Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, is my favourite part of the season. I had been training well and felt that my form going into this weekend was the best that I have had for some time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stybar has finished in the top 10 at the Tour of Flanders three times in his career. His team has yet to announce its full lineup for the event, which takes place on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/zdenek-stybar-will-miss-the-tour-of-flanders-after-undergoing-an-ablation/\">Zdenek Stybar will miss the Tour of Flanders after undergoing an ablation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"46d6abbed692e7166230c181fb26df60520fa2992fc30dace3953925683edb9a","category":"Cycling"}
