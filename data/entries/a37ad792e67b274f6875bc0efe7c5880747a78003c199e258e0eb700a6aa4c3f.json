Facebook was not into that idea.\"</blockquote><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/signal-instagram-ads1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe starkly transparent ads used Signal branding and featured the user's professional role, education, interests, hobbies, location, and relationship status, amongst other personal data points pruned from their interaction with the platform. Unsurprisingly, the ads never made it to Instagram users' feeds and Signal's ad account for the platform was summarily disabled.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"Facebook is more than willing to sell visibility into people's lives, unless it's to tell people about how their data is being used. Being transparent about how ads use people's data is apparently enough to get banned; in Facebook's world, the only acceptable usage is to hide what you're doing from your audience.\"</blockquote>In recent months, Signal has enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/messaging-app-signal-sees-surge-signups/\">surge</a> in account sign-ups following a bungled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp-privacy-policy-data-sharing-facebook/\">privacy policy update</a> by rival service WhatsApp, which caused a user exodus from the Facebook-owned platform.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/signal-instagram-ads2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe privacy-focused chat app has also been promoted by prominent Signal users like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153?s=20\">Tesla CEO Elon Musk</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1347216537757896704?s=20\">Edward Snowden</a>, which has only added to mainstream interest in the service.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/opensignal/\">OpenSignal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/signal/\">Signal</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/05/signal-instagram-targeted-ads-banned/\">Signal Shares the Instagram Ads Facebook Doesn't Want You to See</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/signal-shares-the-instagram-ads-facebook-doesnt-want-you-to-see.2294886/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=huybQLgac9M:2JzghEUlIco:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=huybQLgac9M:2JzghEUlIco:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/huybQLgac9M\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a37ad792e67b274f6875bc0efe7c5880747a78003c199e258e0eb700a6aa4c3f","category":"Apple"}
