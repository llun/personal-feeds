Though the previous version of Docker did work via Apple's Rosetta solution, the introduction of an M1-native version of Docker contributes to a closing gap for developers concerned about running their entire suite of tools in an optimal way.</p>\n<p>It follows the release of M1 versions of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/mac-utility-homebrew-finally-gets-native-apple-silicon-and-m1-support/\">Homebrew</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/visual-studio-code-now-runs-natively-on-m1-macs/\">Visual Studio Code</a>, and other developer tools and applications. But some gaps remainâ€”for example, Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019 IDE (which is distinct from the comparatively lightweight Visual Studio Code) has not been updated.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757200#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757200&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14e5a0d6f83b4ea4cf55fd155b33206c5e21d8ce048147ecb27acfc3a9d6f46c","category":"Tech"}
