However, with the availability of Steam Link on macOS, users now have the option of choosing a lightweight download (29.8MB) to stream games to their Mac, rather than having to install the Steam app proper, which requires 1GB of drive space.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSteam Link <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/15/valves-steam-link-app-now-available-on-ios/\">launched on iOS</a> and tvOS in 2019, however, until now it's been unavailable for Mac customers.
