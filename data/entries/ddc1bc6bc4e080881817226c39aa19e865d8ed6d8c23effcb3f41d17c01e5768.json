We were the first to get our hands on the new Superpods, which retail at $159 apiece. Plume recommended four Superpods total for our 3,500-square-foot test house, so that's precisely how we tested.</p>\n<p>To give the Superpod design every chance to shine, we used a new Wi-Fi 6 enabled test fleet—one equipped with <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/130293/intel-wi-fi-6-ax201-gig.html\">Intel AX201</a> Wi-Fi 6 adapters in place of the 802.11ac <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/83635/intel-dual-band-wireless-ac-7265.html\">Intel 7265</a> adapters in our old test fleet. But replacing the test fleet means needing to generate new baselines. So rather than re-using old tests, we broke out our original 802.11ac Superpods and a three-piece 802.11ac <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33fabYD\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Eero mesh kit</a> to serve as a competitive measurement baseline.</p>\n<p>All three of these kits are top performers—including the Amazon Eero, which routinely beats much higher-spec and higher-priced kits in our testing.
