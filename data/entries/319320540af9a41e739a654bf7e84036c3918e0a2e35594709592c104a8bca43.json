First introduced four years ago, Apple's larger &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; has never sold well because of its high price tag.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/HomePodandMini-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1436\" height=\"808\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-766012\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple hoped that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;'s high-quality sound would give it an edge over competing products, but sales of the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; have always been lackluster with so many more affordable options on the market. Apple has been selling the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; for &#36;299, but it was originally priced at &#36;350. The &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is available for &#36;99.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; offers all of the features of the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in a smaller and less expensive package. Many reviews <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/homepod-mini/\">praised the HomePod mini</a> for its sound quality relative to its size, and while it won't quite match the sound available from the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, it features the same <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> integration, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> support, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> controls.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn a statement, Apple said that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a> stores.<blockquote>&zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just &#36;99. We are focusing our efforts on &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;. We are discontinuing the original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.\r\n<br/>\r\n</blockquote>On Thursday, many tech sites noticed that the full-sized space gray &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/11/space-gray-homepod-shortage/\">was out of stock</a> in the United States, but it was believed to be just a stock shortage. As it turns out, it was because Apple no longer plans to sell the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe space gray &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; can likely be purchased from third-party retailers, but it is no longer available from Apple, while the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in white continues to be available for purchase as of right now. \r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/\">Apple Discontinuing Full-Sized HomePod to Focus on HomePod Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinuing-full-sized-homepod-to-focus-on-homepod-mini.2288158/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KZS4G5KeVIU:tJyHJY4BFIs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KZS4G5KeVIU:tJyHJY4BFIs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KZS4G5KeVIU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"319320540af9a41e739a654bf7e84036c3918e0a2e35594709592c104a8bca43","category":"Apple"}
