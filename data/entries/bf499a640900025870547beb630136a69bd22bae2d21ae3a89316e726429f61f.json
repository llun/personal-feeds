The showcase explains what we should expect from the series' first cross-platform, free-to-play shooter later this year. The best news echoes a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/halo-split-screen-combat-is-coming-back-and-its-here-to-stay/\">2017 Microsoft pronouncement</a>: Split-screen gameplay is back.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has tucked the split-screen news away as a single line of text in <a href=\"https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/halo-infinite-multiplayer-reveal\">this week's blog post on the video reveal</a>. The post also confirms that <em>Halo Infinite</em>, like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/halo-5-guardians-review-everyones-a-hero-no-ones-a-hero/\"><em>Halo 5</em></a>, will support LAN play across all compatible platforms (Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S) via a dedicated \"local server\" app on PC. And the video reaffirms 343 Industries' promise that the series' first-person games \"will always have split-screen support going forward.\" 343 Industries chief Bonnie Ross made that statement in 2017 after <em>Halo 5</em> took <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/halo-5-guardians-review-everyones-a-hero-no-ones-a-hero/\">considerable lumps</a> from the community for cutting that support.</p>\n<p>Today's update only says that split-screen support is available for \"Xbox.\" It does not clarify whether the feature will support fewer players on a single screen on weaker Xbox One consoles or whether such a feature will work via Xbox's burgeoning cloud-gaming options. (Also, can we <em>seriously</em> toggle split-screen options on PC already? We plug computers into big-screen TVs now, 343.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773257#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773257&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bf499a640900025870547beb630136a69bd22bae2d21ae3a89316e726429f61f","category":"Tech"}
