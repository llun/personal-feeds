Despite recommendations to create strong, complicated, and advanced passwords for hotspot connections, many users continue to use simple passwords that may be easily guessed. WPA3 specifically targets such use cases, as it uses \"more resilient, password-based authentication\" that offers \"stronger protections for users against password guessing attempts by third parties.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\niOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌ are currently being tested with developers, with a public beta being planned for later this summer.
