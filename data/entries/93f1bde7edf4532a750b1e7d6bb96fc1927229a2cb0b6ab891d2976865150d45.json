You could even be forgiven for thinking a stray flyer or piece of paper was stuck to it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality, however, required a touch more planning than that. The Italian and European champion confirmed on his Instagram account the custom helmet design he’s wearing is in fact a COVID-19 travel declaration. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COnwyVWhZ14/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/COnwyVWhZ14/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Giacomo Nizzolo (@giacomonizzolo)</a></p></div></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>The declaration states that “the undersigned Giacomo Nizzolo” – followed by his date and place of birth, professional category, team name, and UCI code – is “knowing of the criminal consequences in the case of false statement to public officials.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nizzolo states his reason for travel as “winning stages” between Turin and Milan. The message concludes with “Viva il Giro” and the former Maglia Ciclamino’s signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being one of the first- and worst-hit countries in Europe, Italy began easing COVID-19 restrictions in some areas on April 26th. Six regions, however, remain under stricter lockdowns. Declarations such as Nizzolo’s were required for movement within Italy at the height of restrictions – albeit in paper and digital form, rather than on bicycle helmets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italy currently has the second-highest COVID-19 related death rate in the European Union, with 123,000 deaths from over 4.1 million cases. It is not clear if Nizzolo’s helmet design is motivated by protest, a jest in poor taste, or as a gesture of solidarity and support.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/the-story-behind-giacomo-nizzolos-curious-custom-helmet-design/\">The story behind Giacomo Nizzolo’s curious custom helmet design</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"93f1bde7edf4532a750b1e7d6bb96fc1927229a2cb0b6ab891d2976865150d45","category":"Cycling"}
