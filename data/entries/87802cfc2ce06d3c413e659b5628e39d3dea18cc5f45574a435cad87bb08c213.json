I hope you’ve been able to do the same.</p>\n<p>Before you escape for a weekend of riding, let’s look back over the top stories from this week on BikeRadar.</p>\n<p>We started the week with something of a mountain bike tech news bonanza, with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/santa-cruz-blur-juliana-wilder/\" target=\"_blank\">Santa Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-fox-transfer-sl-dropper-post/\" target=\"_blank\">Fox</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hope-xcr-brake/\" target=\"_blank\">Hope</a> all launching new products. Rapha also finally entered the mountain bike market with its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rapha-performance-trailwear/\" target=\"_blank\">Performance Trailwear range</a>.</p>\n<p>On the road side, we saw Colnago launch <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/colnago-tour-de-france-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">a limited-edition run of its V3Rs road bike</a>, with each priced at a cool £11,090 / $16,339 (ouch).</p>\n<p>Ortlieb also released a nifty new bar bag that uses a system of cords to provide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ortlieb-handlebar-pack-qr/\" target=\"_blank\">a super-clean quick-release mounting system</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-group-challenges/\" target=\"_blank\">Strava added its Group Challenge functionality</a> (which, much to my amusement, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnicholson/status/1400151280710914050\" target=\"_blank\">one BikeRadar reader pointed out could also be called ‘a race’</a>) and also updated its mapping tool.</p>\n<p>Finally, noted Forest of Dean resident and Jack Russell botherer, Matthew Loveridge turned his ever acerbic wit towards <a href=\"http://bikeradar.com/features/opinion/jaguar-ipace-everesting/\" target=\"_blank\">this everesting attempt</a> that took place… in a car?</p>\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPlVgpfM8E6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPlVgpfM8E6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by BikeRadar (@bikeradar)</a></p></div></blockquote><h2>SONdelux dynamo hub</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I have procured a hub to match the SON headlight I have been using for the past few weeks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A few weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/pnw-rainier-dropper/\" target=\"_blank\">we featured my new SON Edelux II headlight in First Look Friday</a>, which I have since fitted to my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/all-city-mr-pink-classic-long-term-review/\">All-City Mr Pink</a>.</p>\n<p>The light has been a bit of a revelation – it is utterly reliable, powerful and the shaped beam is really good.</p>\n<p>Keen to go all-in on a SON system, which will also allow me to use the brand’s neat <a href=\"https://nabendynamo.de/en/products/wiring/son-coaxial-connector-system/\" target=\"_blank\">coaxial cabling system</a>, I’ve got a hold of a matching SONdelux dynamo hub.</p>\n<p>The SONdelux is the lighter-duty version of the brand’s dynamo hubs, using a smaller magnet system that reduces weight and overall drag.</p>\n<p>Its power output is slightly lower at low speeds but, once you reach normal riding speeds the difference is negligible.</p>\n<p>SON’s hubs regularly independently test as having the lowest drag of all dynamo hubs, adding only around 4.5 watts of drag at ~20km/h according to the brand’s own stats.</p>\n<p>In the context of riding a daft <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-steel-road-bikes/\">steel bike</a> with a giant boxy bag on the front, this is a negligible sum – I could probably make up the difference by switching to an aero helmet if I really cared (I don’t care).</p>\n<p>(SON has <a href=\"https://nabendynamo.de/en/tech/son-28-vs-sondelux/\" target=\"_blank\">a helpful in-depth comparison</a> between its two main hubs on its site if you want to learn more.)</p>\n<p>Most dynamo hub axles are stiff to the point of barely being able to turn at all by hand. While how a hub feels in the hand is rarely indicative of real-world performance, turning the SON hub’s axle is remarkably easy.</p>\n<p>Though it is still a bit rumbly (it is packed full of magnets after all), it feels remarkably smooth when used as a satisfying plaything on your desk.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I’m using the 28-hole rim brake variant of the hub.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The hub is also available in thru-axle variants and, looking at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-highland-trail-550-bikes/#:~:text=tyre-,Josh%20Ibbet,1,-of\">the bike Josh Ibbett rode to fourth place at the Highland Trail 550</a>, a Boost variant of the hub is also on the cards.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hub ships covered in plastic to help protect it when lacing the spokes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As a fun aside, the hub ships with the centre of the shell covered in a protective film.

I have run out of potable water.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, I have chosen a picturesque Instagram-compatible spot with a large body of water beside me.</p>\n<p>Not one for a cheeky case of dysentery, I whip out my Katadyn BeFree to effortlessly filter a batch of water, confident my wee tummy will be happy for the night.</p>\n<p>I too can only imagine this situation as, up until this point, I have perhaps foolishly taken my chances when drinking water from streams high in the hills (though I am yet to end up with a poorly belly).</p>\n<p>However, I’ve read a few recent accounts of trips ruined by drinking untreated water.</p>\n<p>It’s also an unfortunate truth that an increasing number of less-experienced people are heading to the hills and leaving… <a href=\"https://news.stv.tv/highlands-islands/locals-anger-over-waste-left-by-north-coast-500-campers?top\" target=\"_blank\">traces of their visit</a>.</p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, it seemed prudent to finally invest in a water filtration system.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Water flows through this tightly packed hollow fibre membrane.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Katadyn BeFree is a membrane filter with 0.1-micron pores that are claimed to filter out 99.999 per cent of harmful bacteria and 99.99 per cent of protozoa (single-celled organisms, some of which are parasitic).</p>\n<p>The filter is said to be good to process up to 1,000 litres of water and is washed simply by shaking it out in fresh water.</p>\n<p>Many brands claim their systems will filter significantly more than 1,000 litres – Sawyer, for example, claims 1-million litres. However, it only takes a little bit of searching to see this figure is widely considered to be optimistic because the filters usually break long before that figure is reached.</p>\n<p>Using the Katadyn for its claimed lifetime works out as roughly three pence per litre, which is pretty good value for money (and is a small price to pay if it means you avoid a bout of porcelain romance midway through a trip).</p>\n<p>I’ll probably still take my chances if I’m in a sheep-free area by fast-flowing water high in the hills but, if I’m in any doubt as to my access to clean water, I’ll be taking this along with me.</p>\n<ul><li>£50 / $40 / AU$TBC</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>dhb Aeron LAB Polartec baselayer</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The dhb Aeron LAB baselayer is made from Polartec Alpha.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>dhb’s new sleeveless Aeron Lab baselayer is made from Polartec Delta.</p>\n<p>This is claimed to “harness the cooling properties of sweat without the cling” by using a mix of hydrophilic (something that water is attracted to) yarns next to your skin to wick away moisture towards the outer hydrophobic (water repellant) yarns.</p>\n<p>This outer layer is claimed to “hold onto the sweat a little bit longer” to aid cooling as it evaporates.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using the baselayer for around two months now and it’s quickly become a firm favourite.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some of the panels have a slightly waffled texture on the inside.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I’m a very sweaty young man and it genuinely feels more comfortable than most of my other baselayers.</p>\n<p>The cooling properties are perhaps slightly exaggerated but it is definitely one of the most comfortable ‘solid panel’ (as opposed to mesh/string) baselayers I have worn in hot weather. It really doesn’t feel clingy when sopping wet with sweat and dries very quickly.</p>\n<p>Unlike my <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/baselayers/brynje-super-thermo-c-shirt-baselayer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">beloved Brynje baselayers</a>, it also doesn’t reek after a full day of riding.
