'To get ahead of the long-term impact of e-bike batteries before their end of life, Specialized UK has established a nationwide partnership with UK-based recycling experts, Ecolamp.'</p>\n<p>While as the name suggests Ecolamp mainly organises the disposal of lamps, it also recycles electrical, computer and office waste with the company claiming that 100% of the e-bike battery packs it collects will be recycled and no materials will end up in landfill.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/2055/the-best-mens-worldtour-team-kits-for-2021\">The best men's WorldTour team kits for 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTo go alongside this, Specialized hopes to roll out its programme of reclaiming and recycling materials and components internationally from next year, with an initial launch in the US coming later this year.
