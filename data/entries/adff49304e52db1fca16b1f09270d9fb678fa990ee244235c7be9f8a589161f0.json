In contrast, only high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models will use mini LED displays, and the overall growth momentum may be lower than that of MacBooks.</blockquote>The 2022 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will also feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, according to Kuo. The analyst believes that Apple will be able to offset the increased cost of using mini-LED panels in its Macs precisely because the cost of ‌&zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj;‌ chips is significantly lower than that of Intel processors.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/\">said last year</a> that he believes a mini-LED &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is due to arrive in 2022, and also said he expected Apple to release two redesigned MacBook Pro models, both equipped with mini-LED displays, in the second half of this year. In today's note, Kuo underlined how much suppliers of mini-LED displays can expect to benefit from Apple's wider adoption of mini-LED a result.\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>We expect the new MacBook Pro will boost the shipment of mini LED displays in 2H21 because the new MacBook Pro will equip with mini LED displays, and MacBook's mini LED display is less challenging to produce than the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. We forecast that mini LED display shipments in 2021 and 2022 to be 10 million and 20–30 million, respectively.</blockquote>In addition to Apple silicon and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a> displays, Kuo expects the new MacBook Pro designs to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">flat-edged top and bottom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">an HDMI port and SD card reader</a>, classic <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charging with a magnetic power cable, and physical function keys instead of the Touch Bar. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/macbook-pro-better-displays-faster-magsafe-charging/\">corroborated many of these details</a>, and he was first to report that an SD card reader is returning.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nToday's note from Kuo also said that Apple's first mini-LED 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> will enter mass production in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/\">second half of April</a>, and that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-oled-ipad-air-in-2022/\">adopt OLED displays</a> in 2022, positioning mini-LED as a display technology exclusive to &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; devices in the company's tablet lineup.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-macbook-air-mini-led-2020-launch/\">Kuo: MacBook Air With Mini-LED Display Still on Track for 2022 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-macbook-air-with-mini-led-display-still-on-track-for-2022-launch.2288730/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=plQLZef1BZM:QerQ7ecF9bg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=plQLZef1BZM:QerQ7ecF9bg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/plQLZef1BZM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"adff49304e52db1fca16b1f09270d9fb678fa990ee244235c7be9f8a589161f0","category":"Apple"}
