{"title":"Alleged Leaked Image Claims to Show Third-Generation AirPods and Case","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/","date":1613904549000,"content":"A <a href=\"http://www.52audio.com/archives/72978.html\">new image</a> claims to offer our first real world look at Apple's next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>. The image, shared by <em><a href=\"http://www.52audio.com/archives/72978.html\">52audio</a></em>, showcases both &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; and the charging case for what the site claims to be the third iteration of the wireless earbuds.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/new-airpods-leaked-image-52audios.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784818\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>52audio</em> has in the past <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/05/alleged-images-of-airpods-3-shared-online/\">shared images</a> claiming to showcase different parts of the third-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;. Most notably, the site in November shared an x-ray image claiming to be the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, however, it was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/05/alleged-images-of-airpods-3-shared-online/\">later proven</a> to be faked and simply a compressed x-ray image of the current-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe image shared today, however, is in line with what we know so far about the third-gen &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;. <em>Bloomberg</em> has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">reported</a> that the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; will take design cues from the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; by having a smaller stem and silicone eartips, but they will reportedly lack high-end features such as Active Noise Cancelation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to <em>52audio</em> and a provided caption of the leaked image, the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; will feature a pressure-relieving system, the same technology featured in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The system is meant to equalize pressure within your ear to remove any discomfort from using the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; for a prolonged period of time. Based on the image, the charging case will be less rectangular than the case that comes with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, and more in keeping with the original &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; case, but with the addition of an LED charging indicator on the front.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe third-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; may also be borrowing touch controls from the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. According to accompanying 3D renders from <em>52audio</em>, each new earbud will feature touch control surfaces, instead of the single and double-tap controls on the current &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; (first and second generation). \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/3d-renders-new-airpods-52audio.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784833\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; are expected to offer the same five hours of continuous audio playback as the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, according to the latest report. This differs from details provided earlier by <em>Bloomberg</em>, however, which claims that Apple is looking to improve battery life on the new model beyond the current five hours of audio playback. Additionally, the new report claims that Spatial Audio support, a feature currently exclusive to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, is \"highly\" probable for the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple analysts <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in November that mass production for the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; will take place in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/kuo-ipad-mini-led-airpods-3-coming-1h21/\">first half of the year</a>. According to <em>52audio</em>, the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; are set to debut at the beginning of March. This week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/no-apple-event-march-16/\">poured cold water</a> on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/prosser-airtags-ipad-pro-next-month/\">speculation</a> that Apple will hold an event on March 16. He did however leave the door open for an event on another date in March.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLeaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a>, who has a mixed-track record when it comes to reporting on Apple's plans, recently reported that an event on March 16 (now unlikely) will headline <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/prosser-airtags-ipad-pro-next-month/\">AirTags and new iPads</a>. Apple released the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; via a press release in 2019, so it remains to be seen how and when Apple will release the next-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">Alleged Leaked Image Claims to Show Third-Generation AirPods and Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-leaked-image-claims-to-show-third-generation-airpods-and-case.2285600/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CGh9R77AOnY:ENDv91NzgZE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CGh9R77AOnY:ENDv91NzgZE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CGh9R77AOnY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de678f756de374126a6dfc33997645a4cdff2ea109425e13b0c97cb1af3d4711","category":"Apple"}
