Normally, those sensors are in a car's wheels, but Pirelli has here embedded them in the construction of the tire, where they measure pressure, temperature, and acceleration.</p>\n<p>That little snippet of information from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/this-plug-in-hybrid-is-mclarens-new-supercar-called-the-artura/\">Artura press briefing</a> left me intrigued, if a little skeptical. So I reached out to Pirelli to see if it could convince me that smart tires are a good idea.</p>\n<p>\"Now we have the technology to install at industrial level a sensor inside the tire and, most of all, integrate the sensor into the car itself,\" said Piero Misani, Pirelli'sÂ senior VP of R&amp;D. \"You can put in a sensor, you can put in an app [linked to a tire], but this is not a dialogue between the tire and the car. That is something that is a standalone system. With the McLaren Artura, we believe that we'll be the first to fully integrate a sensor in the tire with the car's electronics.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768895#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768895&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
