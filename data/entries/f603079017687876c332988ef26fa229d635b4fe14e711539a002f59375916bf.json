(credit: Ars Technica)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p><strong>Update 5:35 pm EDT</strong>: After another sweep of our Prime Day deals roundup, we have struck out a few expired offers, updated prices, and added a few new deals. Those bargains include premium OLED TVs from Sony, well-reviewed air purifiers from Blueair, Blue's popular Yeti microphone, and Samsung <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/new-samsung-980-ssd-improves-on-970-evo-evo-plus-performance/\" target=\"_blank\">SSDs we like</a>, among other discounts you can find below.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 12 pm EDT</strong>: We've added our first batch of new discounts, headlined by the return of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-2021-best-early-deal-gift-card-credit/\" target=\"_blank\">a deal we highlighted</a> a couple weeks back: those who buy at least $40 in Amazon gift cards can <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wQG1I2\" target=\"_blank\">get an extra $10 in Amazon credit</a> at no extra cost. Just use the code \"GCPRIME2021\" at checkout. As before, Amazon says it'll email the credit to you within two days of your purchase. The credit will only be applicable to items sold by Amazon itself, and you'll have to spend it by August 7. Deals like these are a way for Amazon to keep customers locked into its store, but if you plan on buying from the site anyway, it's a nifty bonus.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Apple's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wJD7Fa\" target=\"_blank\">latest iPad Air</a> is now down to a joint-low of $520, and we've found new deals on Nvidia's Shield TV, recommended board games <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/ars-technicas-ultimate-board-game-gift-guide-2019-edition/8/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dixit</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2015/11/ars-cardboard-mysteriums-dreamy-world-is-ghostly-good-fun/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mysterium</em></a>, a good Anker battery pack, and more. Since this post first went live, we've also put together roundups for those looking to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021-under-50/\" target=\"_blank\">spend less than $50</a> and those <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021-target-best-buy-walmart/\" target=\"_blank\">who don't subscribe to Prime</a> but still want some savings.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774658#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774658&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f603079017687876c332988ef26fa229d635b4fe14e711539a002f59375916bf","category":"Tech"}
