Released less than a year after the launch of the original ‌‌iPad‌‌, the second-generation ‌‌iPad‌‌ marked a breakthrough for the product line and set the groundwork for years to come.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/2nd-Generation-iPad-Obsolete-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple added the ‌iPad‌ 2 to its \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">vintage and obsolete</a>\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/01/apple-obsoletes-eight-year-old-ipad-2-models/\">product list in May of 2019</a>, which marked the ‌iPad‌ as obsolete in all countries except the United States and Turkey, where local law required Apple to continue to consider it a vintage product. Yesterday, however, Apple updated its list to add the new ‌iPad‌ to its official obsolete list, deeming it obsolete worldwide. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe second-generation ‌iPad‌ included an updated design that was 33% thinner than the original ‌iPad‌. The new ‌iPad‌ also sported new capabilities, including a front-facing camera for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls, a gyroscope, and an updated dual-core A5 processor, twice as fast as the original ‌iPad‌ and up to nine times faster in graphics. The ‌iPad‌ was also offered in both white and black models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple classifies products that have been discontinued for at least seven years as \"obsolete,\" meaning that they are unable to receive any hardware service from Apple or its service providers.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">vintage and obsolete</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/21/ipad-2-considered-obsolete-worldwide/\">iPad 2 Now Considered Obsolete Worldwide</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-2-now-considered-obsolete-worldwide.2297070/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wbB2wJUed_w:7h0BSWwlNGg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wbB2wJUed_w:7h0BSWwlNGg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wbB2wJUed_w\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5485cc9ea38948f2ba7681cd53a131b0ac4d09fa0a5fbe46febda04927f8ad5d","category":"Apple"}
