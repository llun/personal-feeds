The 30-year-old Australian bested Bissegger’s mark by 11 seconds with a time of 5:26, and from there, nobody came particularly close to beating his time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dennis’s Ineos Grenadiers teammates <strong>Geraint Thomas</strong> and <strong>Richie Porte</strong> came closest, with Thomas taking runner-up honors on the day at nine seconds back and Porte in third, a few fractions of a second slower than Thomas but two seconds faster than fourth-placed <strong>Rémi Cavagna</strong>.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Tour de Romandie (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>Oron → Oron</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255760\">Full results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>1</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">DENNIS Rohan</a>\n                                        <span>INEOS Grenadiers</span>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <time>00:05:26</time>\n                            </div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>2</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">THOMAS Geraint</a>\n                                        <span>INEOS Grenadiers</span>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <time>00:00:09</time>\n                            </div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>3</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">PORTE Richie</a>\n                                        <span>INEOS Grenadiers</span>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <time>00:00:09</time>\n                            </div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>4</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">CAVAGNA Rémi</a>\n                                        <span>Deceuninck -

Nearly two years removed from his crash at the <strong>Critérium du Dauphiné</strong>, Froome continues to work towards getting back to his old level of form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’ve got four spots and it’s not an easy team to fight your way into,” Brammeier said. “Unfortunately, it’s not looking great for Chris on my behalf anyway.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brammeier noted that the riders he is currently “seriously considering” for the four available spots are <strong>Geraint Thomas</strong>, <strong>Adam Yates</strong>, <strong>Simon Yates</strong>, <strong>Tao Geoghegan Hart</strong>, <strong>James Knox</strong>, <strong>Hugh Carthy</strong>, <strong>Tom Pidcock</strong>, <strong>Luke Rowe</strong>, and <strong>Alex Dowsett</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>UCI reveals format for Track Champions League</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>UCI</strong> has unveiled the format of its new <strong>Track Champions League</strong>, which it is running in partnership with GCN and Eurosport. The new format will see 36 men and 36 women racing in November and December across six weekends, with 18 men and 18 women competing in the Sprint League and 18 men and 18 women competing in the Endurance League.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders will earn points through their results in the various sprint or endurance events that will accumulate over the course of the competition towards declaring a final winner. Riders will qualify through the Track World Championships, which take place in October. According to a statement from organizers, prize money for the men and women at the Track Champions League will be equal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming up …</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tour de Romandie continues on Wednesday with an intriguing stage 1 that starts in Aigle and then heads into a tricky circuit in and around Martigny. Four visits each to the Produit and Chamoson climbs could whittle away at the pack before a mostly flat finish, where Peter Sagan could be among the favorites for the win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Iain Treloar writes, the <strong>best thing</strong> on the Internet today is this <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/the-best-thing-on-the-internet-today-is-this-lovely-ode-to-trail-dogs/\" target=\"_blank\">ode to trail dogs</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/rohan-dennis-wins-the-tour-de-romandie-prologue-daily-news/\">Rohan Dennis wins the Tour de Romandie prologue: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6906059e4199646c8dc8bd58c64e485e4a8963a7ff4f23939e9e84a4163d0685","category":"Cycling"}
