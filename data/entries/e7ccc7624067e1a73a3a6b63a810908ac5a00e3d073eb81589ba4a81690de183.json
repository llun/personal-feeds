The second-gen device is shorter than the original version and charges inductively. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Pencil‌ depicted also appears to have a considerably larger tip component than in existing versions, with a much longer section that screws into the ‌‌Apple Pencil‌‌ itself, possibly hinting at new technology to support additional features or provide greater drawing accuracy. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple still sells the first-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌, mainly to appeal to eighth-gen <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> 5 owners, since the second-gen version only works with the ‌iPad Pro‌. An ‌Apple Pencil‌ 3 could theoretically bring new functions exclusive to Apple's next high-end ‌iPad Pro‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is expected to use its April 20 event to unveil a new 11-inch and 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, with the higher-end model featuring a brand new mini-LED display. Well-connected <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman believes that these new iPads will be an \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/gurman-apple-event-nothing-innovative/\">iterative update</a>\" to the ‌iPad‌ line.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn today's Weibo post, \"Uncle Pan Pan\" also shared an image allegedly showing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3, although Apple isn't expected to launch the third iteration of ‌AirPods‌ until the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">third quarter of this year</a>, which would rule them out of Apple's April event. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/apple-pencil-3-again-rumored/\">Apple Again Rumored to Be Readying Third-Generation Apple Pencil</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-again-rumored-to-be-readying-third-generation-apple-pencil.2291773/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZulFE09WWxk:Z6uKQSvYyzY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZulFE09WWxk:Z6uKQSvYyzY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZulFE09WWxk\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7ccc7624067e1a73a3a6b63a810908ac5a00e3d073eb81589ba4a81690de183","category":"Apple"}
