Even on Verizon, the carrier with the most aggressive rollout of mmWave 5G, users with compatible devices spent 0.8 percent of their time on the high-frequency network that uses its large capacity to provide faster speeds than low- and mid-band spectrum.</p>\n<p>Average download speeds on mmWave 5G were 232.7Mbps for AT&amp;T, 215.3Mbps for T-Mobile, and 692.9Mbps for Verizon.
