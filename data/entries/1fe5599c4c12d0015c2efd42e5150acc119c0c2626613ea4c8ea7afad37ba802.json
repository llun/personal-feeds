That brings heavy nostalgia for the childhood halcyon days of All-You-Can-Eat Pizza Hut dine-ins in Australia (since whittled down to just 11 restaurants nationwide), but Belgium is a more advanced civilisation that has held onto the good stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RemcoHut collaboration encourages consumers to “find a balance between a healthy lifestyle and pampering yourself every now and then”. Perhaps aware of the oddness of signing a standard bearer of a sport that has an unhealthy relationship with food, Pizza Hut was quick to point to the less coagulated sectors of its “very extensive menu”, which includes “salads … several veggie options… and [the] recently launched vegan Beyond pizza.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"889\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3-1340x889.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-489375\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3-1340x889.jpeg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3-650x431.jpeg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3-190x126.jpeg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3-1080x716.jpeg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3-16x11.jpeg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Remco-Pizza-3.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>The Ambassador gazes into middle distance, enormous fists balled on the table, dreaming wistfully of Pizza Hut&#8217;s decadent dessert range. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the <a href=\"https://www.pizzahut.be/nl/app/catalog/PIZZA\">Pizza Hut menu</a> looks pretty familiar to my pre-teen recollections – albeit with some regional quirks, like the sour cream and sliced cheese Grimbergen, the pineapple-heavy Sweet Chicken Curry, and something called a Cheesam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Remco, he seems pretty stoked on the five-year deal, which will see him appear in TV commercials along with going full-press on social media. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Of course I have to pay attention to what I eat,” Evenepoel noted yearningly, “but I also need relaxation and good food. Then I dare to order a pizza from Pizza Hut.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing as Pizza Hut Belgium has a tuna and black olive pizza on its menu, that may be more daring than it first sounds.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/remco-evenepoel-is-the-face-of-pizza-hut/\">Remco Evenepoel is the new face of Pizza Hut</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"1fe5599c4c12d0015c2efd42e5150acc119c0c2626613ea4c8ea7afad37ba802","category":"Cycling"}
