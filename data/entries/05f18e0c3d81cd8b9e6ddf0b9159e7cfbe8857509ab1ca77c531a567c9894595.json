Early in the study—before B.1.351 emerged—the vaccine appeared over 70 percent effective at preventing mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19. That is largely in line with the conclusion of an international Phase III trial released by AstraZeneca and vaccine co-developer Oxford University, which showed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/astrazenecas-best-covid-vaccine-result-was-a-fluke-experts-have-questions/\">mixed results</a> for the replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccine but an overall efficacy of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-shows-success-heres-how-it-stacks-up-to-others/\">around 70 percent</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740664#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740664&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05f18e0c3d81cd8b9e6ddf0b9159e7cfbe8857509ab1ca77c531a567c9894595","category":"Tech"}
