If the test program is successful, the iPhone 12 will be rolled out to all of the airline's agents over the next year. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmerican Airlines maintenance technicians have started receiving the seventh-generation iPad, the memo added. Once that rollout is complete by the end of June, they will no longer need to carry two different tablets for different aircraft and activities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmerican Airlines pilots will continue to use iPads. The airline recently added a real-time weather app and a new turbulence awareness app to the devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting in the first quarter of 2022, American Airlines flight attendants will receive an iPhone 12 for customer service and flight management purposes, according to the memo. The new iPhones will have a customized attachment that will accept multiple forms of payment for in-flight purchases, including contactless payments like Apple Pay.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.myhealthyapple.com/\">MyHealthyApple</a>!)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/american-airlines/\">American Airlines</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/american-airlines-rolling-out-iphones-ipads/\">American Airlines Rolling Out iPhones and iPads to Flight Attendants and Others Over the Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/american-airlines-rolling-out-iphones-and-ipads-to-flight-attendants-and-others-over-the-next-year.2302005/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xHsxSCMs9as:-Uiw2yC6gRc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=xHsxSCMs9as:-Uiw2yC6gRc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/xHsxSCMs9as\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2eaa9323cd0413063aa9c6c8a03ff30f12eb5b8bc6373106bea85a4de235d12b","category":"Apple"}
