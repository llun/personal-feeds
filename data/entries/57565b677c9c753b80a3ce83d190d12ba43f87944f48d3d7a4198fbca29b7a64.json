Documents \"relating to accounting, administration, legal, HR, investors relations and more\" were also allegedly compromised.</p>\n<p>While the hackers apparently used ransomware software to lock CDPR out of certain parts of its systems, the company says it should be able to restore access to the data through backups. The company also remained defiant in the face of a ransom demand of an unspecified amount, saying it wouldn't negotiate, despite a threat to release the stolen data. \"We will not give in to the demands nor negotiate with the actor, being aware that this may eventually lead to the release of the compromised data,\" the company wrote. The demand came with a 48-hour deadline.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740773#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740773&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57565b677c9c753b80a3ce83d190d12ba43f87944f48d3d7a4198fbca29b7a64","category":"Tech"}
