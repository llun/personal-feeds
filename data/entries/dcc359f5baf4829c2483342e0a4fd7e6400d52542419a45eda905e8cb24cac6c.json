That's only $5 off Apple's MSRP, but it's the lowest price we've seen to date on the accessory, which launched in October.</p>\n<p>We recently recommended the MagSafe Charger in our <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/best-magsafe-accessories-for-iphone-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guide to the best iPhone 12 accessories</a>. The charger is primarily designed for the iPhone 12 family, but it can supply those devices with an advertised 15W of power, so it'll recharge quicker than the 7.5W rate available with many Qi chargers (albeit not twice as fast). It attaches to its intended phones easily, and it can recharge through certain MagSafe-compatible cases. You'll <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">need a 20W or higher USB-C PD 3.0 wall charger</a> on hand to supply its full power, and if you don't care about the convenience of simply plopping your iPhone on a pad to recharge, using a traditional USB-C-to-Lightning cable will still top your device up much faster. Here, you'll go from 0 to 30 percent charge in about a half hour, and from 0 to 50 percent charge in about an hour.</p>\n<p>So, while the MagSafe Charger is not a great value in a vacuum, this deal lessens the cost a bit for iPhone 12 owners who live in the Apple ecosystem and are willing to pay for the fastest wireless charge possible. Elsewhere, our deals roundup includes big discounts on Apple's AirPods Pro and iPad Air, several deals on Amazon Fire HD tablets, a big Xbox digital game sale, and more.
