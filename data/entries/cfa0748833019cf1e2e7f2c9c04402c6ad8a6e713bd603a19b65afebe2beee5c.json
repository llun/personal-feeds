As the day wore on, many saw these blackouts extend for ever longer periods of the day, and grid authorities are expecting problems to extend into at least Tuesday. As of noon local time on Monday, the Southwest Power Pool, which serves areas to the north of Texas, also announced that demand was exceeding generating capacity.</p>\n<p>The shortfalls appear to be widespread, affecting everything from wind turbines to nuclear plants. One source of trouble may be an increased competition for natural gas, which is commonly used for heating in the United States.</p>\n<h2>Coming up short</h2>\n<p>Texas is unusual in that almost the entire state is part of a single grid that lacks extensive integration with those of surrounding states. That grid is run by an organization called ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a non-profit controlled by the state legislature.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742426#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742426&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cfa0748833019cf1e2e7f2c9c04402c6ad8a6e713bd603a19b65afebe2beee5c","category":"Tech"}
