{"title":"Netflix Launches 'Fast Laughs' Feature on iOS for TikTok-Style Comedy Moments","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-feature-on-ios/","date":1614790135000,"content":"Netflix has today <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/fast-laughs-is-here\">announced</a> the launch of its \"Fast Laughs\" feature, available now in the video streaming service's iOS app (via <a href=\"https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/netflix-launching-fast-laughs-feature-for-iphone-android-coming-soon/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+iphoneincanada+%28iPhone+in+Canada+-+Canada%27s+%231+iPhone+Resource%29\"><em>iPhone in Canada</em></a>).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/netflix-fast-laughs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786628\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFast Laughs offer \"a full-screen feed of funny clips from our big comedy catalog including films, series and stand-up from comedians like Kevin Hart and Ali Wong,\" according to Netflix director of product innovation Patrick Flemming. Netflix says that the mobile-only section will provide up to 100 new curated clips per day.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTo access the feature, users will find a new \"Fast Laughs\" tab in the Netflix app. Clips will auto-play and the feed effectively resembles TikTok with vertical scrolling. The view includes a \"LOL\" button, which releases a burst of \"Face with Tears of Joy\" emojis when tapped.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Netflix-app-Fast-Laughs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1528\" height=\"860\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786808\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNetflix users can customize their Fast Laughs feed by adding series, films, and stand-up specials to their lists. Individual clips from Fast Laughs can also be easily shared via iMessage, WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFast Laughs acts as an entry point to begin watching a comedy show immediately, but it also functions as a destination to watch standalone entertaining moments. The Fast Laughs feature is unavailable on Netflix kids' profiles, and users are able to filter displayed content based on their set maturity level.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFast Laughs is available now for users in English-speaking countries such as the U.S., Canada, UK, Australia, and Ireland. The feature is also expected to come to the Netflix app for Android at some point in the future.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-feature-on-ios/\">Netflix Launches &#039;Fast Laughs&#039; Feature on iOS for TikTok-Style Comedy Moments</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-feature-on-ios-for-tiktok-style-comedy-moments.2286918/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_sap_TwcJqo:ZeLfSY7cVMM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_sap_TwcJqo:ZeLfSY7cVMM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_sap_TwcJqo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fff04e5650674334b24dd404291ab2ce24717cf7b1918a6f8ba780e19c1f86c8","category":"Apple"}
