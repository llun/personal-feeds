Both models will become available for pre-order starting on April 30, and Apple says they'll be shipping in the second half of May.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/m1-ipad-pro-magic-keyboards.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1386643873527697410\">according to Apple leaker Jon Prosser</a>, the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, which features a faster ‌M1‌ processor and improved cameras compared to the previous model, will be shipping on May 22. The larger 12.9-inch model, which features the ‌M1‌ chip, better cameras, and a new mini-LED display, will ship a day earlier, on May 21.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is worth noting that May 22, which is when Prosser claims the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ will be shipping, is on a Saturday. Apple typically refrains from product launches during the weekend.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBefore Apple's product announcement last week, reports had suggested that Apple was suffering from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/ipad-macbook-production-postponed-nikkei/\">considerable supply restraints</a>. The ongoing chip shortage is reportedly impacting several of Apple's suppliers, and the delay between the announcement and shipments of the new devices has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/high-end-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issue/\">appears to back up these reports</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has in the past announced products only to ship them weeks later, so the situation is not entirely peculiar. While we know the dates for the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Pros, we're still in the dark on the redesigned 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, which Apple also says will begin shipping in the second half of May.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/new-ipad-pro-shipping-dates-leaker/\">Leaker Claims 11-inch iPad Pro to Ship on May 22, 12.9-inch on May 21</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-claims-11-inch-ipad-pro-to-ship-on-may-22-12-9-inch-on-may-21.2293296/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ieB7DkNZEJM:V6Qjv2pPyOk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ieB7DkNZEJM:V6Qjv2pPyOk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ieB7DkNZEJM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e43e9534394c9dec2dcfb8290db9461d81642c83c51d2f0215a592ec30fccddc","category":"Apple"}
