By the time they figured out just how hard autocorrect algorithms were, I was already rolling out the swipe version of my keyboard, quickly approaching iPhone typing speeds. So how did they beat me?\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFirst, they made an app that appeared to fulfill the promise of a watch keyboard – but was practically unusable. Then, they started heavily advertising on FB & Instagram, using my own promo video, of my own app, with my actual name on it.</blockquote>According to Eleftheriou, there are several clones of his FlickType app, but one of the most clear non-functional rip-offs was \"KeyWatch,\" which launched with a blank interface and an \"Unlock now\" button. Tapping the button prompted users to confirm an &#36;8/week subscription for an app that doesn't do anything.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Eleftheriou, the scam achieved prominence in the App Store by gaming Apple's algorithmic ranking system through the purchase of fake ratings and glowing five-star reviews, which bumped it up to the top of its app category. It even advertised its software using his own promotional video, which includes his actual name.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Up to now, I&#39;ve been in the &quot;Apple *wants* to do the right thing&quot; camp.

Eleftheriou says that before KeyWatch was taken down, the developers had long benefited from what had become a &#36;2 million-per-year scam that went largely unnoticed by Apple moderators until he personally exposed it.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSince that time, Eleftheriou has been on a Twitter crusade to expose more scam apps in the App Store, such as the so-called star gazing app that goes by the name \"Star Gazer+\" and basically uses the same time-proven strategy of masquerading as a genuine app that's barely functional and hoodwinks users into an exorbitant in-app weekly subscription fee. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs of writing, the scam app \"Star Gazer+\" is still listed on the App Store with 4.5 star average rating and over 80,000 reviews.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEleftheriou's exposure of the rampant App Store scheme has led many more developers and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1358822574243905538?s=20\">critics</a> to share their own experiences and hopefully put pressure on Apple to tighten up its app moderation and consider overhauling its billing interface and options, including the suggestion of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1358089727962980356\">removing</a> the weekly subscription option altogether. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has yet to comment on Eleftheriou's findings, but we'll be sure to update this article if we hear anything.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/scam-apps-ios-making-millions-revenue/\">Scam iOS Apps Still Raking in Millions in Revenue on App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/scam-ios-apps-still-raking-in-millions-in-revenue-on-app-store.2283962/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bqkmuo_Rn24:NqNkSvXCeRk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bqkmuo_Rn24:NqNkSvXCeRk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bqkmuo_Rn24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5e182152c7375ab25eaa9729d2641e67c4a71696431e255bac4674cbe5d91e93","category":"Apple"}
