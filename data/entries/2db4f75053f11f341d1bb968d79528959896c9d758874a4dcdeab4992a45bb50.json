When the event started in 2006, it only offered the milestone 200-mile route. With the growing popularity of gravel racing and in an attempt to make the race more accessible to all cyclists, Unbound Gravel now offers a total of six racecourses. Participants can now choose between 25, 50, 100, 200, and the big, bad 350-mile course. There’s even a High School event! While the 200 is still the marquee distance for the event, Unbound has something for everyone looking to get dusty out in the Flint Hills.<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IanMatteson_20210605_IWM6495-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Unbound has grown with the popularity of gravel races, growing from a startline of 34 racers back in 2006 to nearly 4,000 riders from all 50 states and 38 countries in 2021.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/IanMatteson_20210605_IWM0154-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/analogstrikesback/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ian Matteson</a> was on the ground for the weekend and has delivered a massive gallery that runs the gamut of the participants on course, so enjoy this slideshow showcasing the course, the riders, and the rolling hills vernacular.
