{"title":"Mass Production of A15 Chip for iPhone 13 Set to Begin Ahead of Schedule in Late May","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/a15-mass-production-late-may/","date":1617719392000,"content":"Longtime Apple supplier TSMC is set to begin mass shipments of Apple's upcoming A15 chip for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> ahead of schedule at the end of May, according to a snippet of a full report set to be published tomorrow by <em>DigiTimes</em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/iPhone-13-Notch-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"659\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-779687\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new chip will be based on an enhanced version of the 5nm process, which first debuted in the A14 Bionic with the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup. While the full report will likely offer more details as to the specifics of the new chip that will power the next-generation iPhones, it can be reasonably assumed that it will improve on performance and power efficiency.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDue to impacts to suppliers as a result of the global health crisis, Apple launched the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; series in October, out of the normal September timeframe. With impacts to supply chains now easing, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes that Apple is on track to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/12/kuo-expects-iphone-13-mass-production-on-time/\">release the iPhone 13 in September</a>. With TSMC now believed to be starting mass shipments of the new chip ahead of schedule, that certainly does seem to be the case. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nImproved performance and power efficiency in the A15 will be one of the multiple rumored features coming to the 2021 iPhones. Information so far suggests that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">Apple will relocate the earpiece</a> to the top bezel for the upcoming iPhones, resulting in a smaller notch. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nInternally, Apple is expected to include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">ProMotion 120Hz and always-on-display</a> for at least some &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; models. Additional features include a rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/26/iphone-13-matt-black-stainless-steel-coating/\">new matte black option</a>, improved fingerprint resistance for the stainless steel edges, and possibly an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-optical/\">in-screen fingerprint sensor</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/\">TSMC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/a15-mass-production-late-may/\">Mass Production of A15 Chip for iPhone 13 Set to Begin Ahead of Schedule in Late May</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mass-production-of-a15-chip-for-iphone-13-set-to-begin-ahead-of-schedule-in-late-may.2290801/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QA38UjPefQI:XbPW5sIgcPM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QA38UjPefQI:XbPW5sIgcPM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QA38UjPefQI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"00dbc46b8c6f50420379fdd1ae6c6fce7b51cd499d4e0db185ee9ad67f38d979","category":"Apple"}
