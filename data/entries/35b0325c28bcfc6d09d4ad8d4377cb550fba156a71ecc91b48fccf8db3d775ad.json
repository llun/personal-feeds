Previously, Merida bikes have used integrated cockpits by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/vision/\" target=\"_blank\">Vision</a>, but a lack of obvious branding suggests this could be something of Merida’s own making. If so, this would be a first for the Taiwanese brand.</p>\n<p>For better or worse then, it follows many of the same trends the majority of other high-performance road bikes on the market do.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Best road bikes</a></li>\n</ul><p>That said, it also looks very much like a slimmed-down <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/merida-reacto-team-e/\" target=\"_blank\">Merida Reacto</a> – the brand’s full-fat <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">aero road bike</a>.
