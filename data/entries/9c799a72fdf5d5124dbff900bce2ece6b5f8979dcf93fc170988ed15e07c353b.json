Apple</em> trial today. The executive's testimony served up some interesting comparisons and contrasts with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-vs-apple-opening-arguments-suggest-a-bitter-battle-over-ios-future/\">Epic's complaints</a>Â and addressed questions about the Xbox consoles' closed, iOS-style app market and the difficulties Microsoft faced getting xCloud streaming on iOS devices.</p>\n<h2>Open vs. closed</h2>\n<p>In defending <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/as-epic-attacks-apple-and-google-it-ignores-the-same-problems-on-consoles/\">Microsoft's iOS-style 30 percent commission on apps sold on the Xbox store</a>, Wright pointed out that the company has never made a profit on the sale of an Xbox console.

We need gamers to be able to have a console. We make money back in the long run on game sales and gaming subscriptions.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762866#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762866&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c799a72fdf5d5124dbff900bce2ece6b5f8979dcf93fc170988ed15e07c353b","category":"Tech"}
