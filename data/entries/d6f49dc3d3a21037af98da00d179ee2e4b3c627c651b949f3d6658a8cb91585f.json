Instead of a keychain that you can attach to things, Apple is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences/&amp;xcust=1-1-342763-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences/\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnering with third-party device manufacturers to use the Find My app</a> to track down things they have lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like Apple&rsquo;s own devices, third-party manufacturers who sign up for the Works with Apple Find My program will be able to tap into the Find My network to see where lost items are on a map, even if they can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t connect to the internet. The vast Find My network uses end-to-end encryption to crowdsource data from the hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world to help locate missing items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Works with Apple Find My devices will be able to take advantage of ultra-wideband technology in the iPhone 11, iPhone 12, and Apple Watch Series 6 to track products with greater precision. It&rsquo;s not clear whether Apple will allow devices to be powered down or remotely wiped as you can with Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-100060963\" srcset=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg 2400w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=1240,826 1240w, https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-find-my-items.jpg?resize=150,100 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px\"></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Belkin, Chipolo, and VanMoof have already created products using the new specification, which will all include a &ldquo;Works with Apple Find My&rdquo; label. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-US/198035-vanmoof-s3-and-x3-now-work-with-apple-s-find-my-app&amp;xcust=1-1-342763-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.vanmoof.com/news/en-US/198035-vanmoof-s3-and-x3-now-work-with-apple-s-find-my-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">VanMoof is adding support to its S3 and X3 e-bikes</a> beginning today, Belkin is bringing Find My to its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-AUC002/&amp;xcust=1-1-342763-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-AUC002/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds</a>, and Chipolo is baking Find My into its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-one&amp;xcust=1-1-342763-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-one\" rel=\"nofollow\">One Bluetooth tracker</a>.
