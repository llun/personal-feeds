Specifically, Saudi Arabia represented nearly half of all smartphones shipped in the region for Q4. However, it witnessed an overall decline in shipments compared to the previous quarter. The UAE represented 26.1% of smartphone shipments for the region in the quarter and saw overall growth compared to Q3.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nQuarter-on-quarter, Apple saw a significant increase of 55% in ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ shipments, growth that was primarily enabled by the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ and last year's ‌&zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj;‌ lineup. Akash Balachandran, IDC's senior research analyst, says that if it were not for shortages amongst Apple's supply chain, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; shipments would have been more prominent in the quarter.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/prMETA47561821-F-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"781\" height=\"655\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-791148\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple still, however, rests behind Samsung as the leading smartphone maker in the region. Samsung holds 42% of the market share for the GCC, 3% less than it did the previous quarter. Apple saw its market share increase by 7% to 23% in the final quarter of the year.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/\">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/iphone-shipment-growth-gulf-countries/\">iPhone Shipments to Gulf Countries Saw Double-Digit Growth in Q4 2020</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-shipments-to-gulf-countries-saw-double-digit-growth-in-q4-2020.2289943/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P5kA-vpGtTs:r1turZsdgg8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P5kA-vpGtTs:r1turZsdgg8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/P5kA-vpGtTs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f63dc9947d8b445993f7f63daa79b0385bd672cbb5ea0f0b3a7db8d6b181818","category":"Apple"}
