So, what the F has changed?</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9781/pinarello-dogma-f-images#11\"><p><span>Image 12 of</span> 55</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/roberto_bragotto_-_photographer-12.jpg?itok=CZkAYyOV\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 12 of </span>55</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Better everywhere, again</h3>\n<p>Despite insisting that weight wasn't a focus for the Dogma F, Pinarello claims the full disc frame module is 11% lighter than the F12 Disc, with a size 53 bike (built with Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 and DT Swiss ARC 50 wheels) said to weigh 6.8kg. The rim brake equivalent built up similarly is apparently comfortably below the <a href=\"/tags/uci\">UCI</a> minimum weight limit.</p>\n<p>That trimming mainly comes from material innovations and re-egineering auxillary parts rather than the frame itself, which Pinarello has capped at 850g since the Dogma F8.</p>\n<p>Alongside the top spec Toray carbon – Torayca T1100 1K with Nanoalloy Technology, the same that's used in the most advanced race cars and aircraft – 3D-printed titanium has been deployed on a mass production bike for the first time to shed grams.</p>\n<p>Weight savings come right across the board though, with a cumulative 265g supposedly saved by refinements in the seatpost, headset, fork, cockpit and thru-axles. Despite the weight loss, Pinarello says it has still managed to make it 12% stiffer around the bottom bracket compared to the F12.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9781/pinarello-dogma-f-images#23\"><p><span>Image 24 of</span> 55</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/website-p22_dogma_f_b610_part4.png?itok=tjXJd2my\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 24 of </span>55</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>The prime focus of the bike is the handling, something Pinarello emphasises is always the case, and this incarnation has an updated Onda fork that the brand says has been designed separately for the disc and rim brake models of the bike.</p>\n<p>That brings us onto aerodynamics. The shape of the fork legs are inspired by Pinarello's Bolide TT bike and are said to work like sails, favouring forward movement in crosswinds, with stronger wind providing a bigger benefit to the rider.</p>\n<p>Pinarello says the refined shaping of the Dogma F means drag only starts having an effect halfway along the frame – which is asymmetrical to account for the drivetrain and add to the balancing act analogy – with an improved rear triangle to 'harmoniously' channel the airflow out the rear.</p>\n<p>All in, those changes, Pinarello says, make the Dogma F disc version 4.8% more aero than the F12.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9781/pinarello-dogma-f-images#35\"><p><span>Image 36 of</span> 55</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/website-p22_dogma_f_b611_campagnolo_campagnolo_ore8.png?itok=vmc0NVs5\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 36 of </span>55</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Spoilt for choice</h3>\n<p>The highlight of the Dogma F's launch campaign is the quote, 'We will never use T-shirt sizes to measure our bikes'.</p>\n<p>There are actually 352 available iterations of the Dogma F, with customers able to choose from 11 frame sizes, 16 handlebar sizes and two setback options on the seatpost, ensuring the best possible fit for each rider – a process that Pinarello likens to getting a tailored suit.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9170/tour-series-2021-postponed-until-august\">Tour Series 2021 postponed until August</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 115: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe new bike is available in a choice of disc or rim brake (although the rim brake version won't be available until the beginning of 2022), and in Sram, Shimano or Campagnolo guises, plus in three different colour options: 'plutonium flash' – silver and black;
