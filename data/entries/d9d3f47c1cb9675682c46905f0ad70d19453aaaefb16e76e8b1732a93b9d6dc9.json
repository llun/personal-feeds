The report adds that the new iPad mini will switch from a Lightning connector to USB-C and will be equipped with \"dramatically improved\" speakers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Prosser, the new iPad mini will be powered by the A14 chip, support 5G, and have compatibility with a new, smaller Apple Pencil. The device will launch by the end of the year in three colors, including black, silver, and gold.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/ipad-mini-6-bottom.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report claims the new iPad mini will have dimensions of 206.3mm x 137.8mm x 6.1mm, but no display size was offered. The current iPad mini has a 7.9-inch display, and <em>Bloomberg</em> has claimed the new model could have an 8.5- to 9-inch display. The rear shell looks similar to the current iPad Air, with a single camera and a Smart Connector.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nProsser has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. He accurately revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/prosser-macbook-air-colors-similar-to-imac/\">new iMac would be available in a variety of colors</a>, but he was mostly recently wrong about a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/wwdc-new-macbook-pro-models/\">new MacBook Pro being announced at WWDC</a> this week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">Next iPad Mini Will Allegedly Feature Thinner Bezels, USB-C Port, and Touch ID Power Button</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-mini-will-allegedly-feature-thinner-bezels-usb-c-port-and-touch-id-power-button.2300497/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gQci5KIumgc:6o1n8xOh1fE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gQci5KIumgc:6o1n8xOh1fE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gQci5KIumgc\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d9d3f47c1cb9675682c46905f0ad70d19453aaaefb16e76e8b1732a93b9d6dc9","category":"Apple"}
