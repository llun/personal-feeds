It can be seen as the latest in recent efforts by Strava to improve its mapping for route planning after overhauling it earlier this year by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-group-challenges/\">grouping segments and routes in one place</a>.</p>\n<p>Strava also says the 3D global heatmap update is particularly useful for “athletes who frequent mountainous or varied terrain”, which might go without saying – who wants to see a 3D elevation of a pancake-flat ride?</p>\n<p>Available across activity types, it won’t just be cyclists who benefit from this new feature, but hikers, trail runners and skiers too.</p>\n<p>Unlike the recent update to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-personalised-progress-chart/\">Strava’s progress chart</a>, this update will only be available to subscribers, and will only be available on Strava’s web app. A subscription costs £47.99 / $59.99 for a 12-month membership or £6.99/$7.99 a month.</p>\n<p>Subscribers will be able to toggle between their personal heat map in 3D and the global heatmap, for comparison between personal activity and what other athletes are up to.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"86de7aaa43be155c499b7f0044e41eff8bfbbc2df5b559aa4ad5dd08ea8b264c","category":"Cycling"}
