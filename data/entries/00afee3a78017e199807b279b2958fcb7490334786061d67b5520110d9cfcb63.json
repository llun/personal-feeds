A standard set without pots includes:</p>\n<ul><li>1 x Ginseng Ficus Bonsai – with swollen roots that grow above the soil, the <em>Ficus retusa </em>is popular both for its eye-catching appearance and because it’s easy to care for. (10-20cm)</li>\n<li>1 x Marble Queen – or <em>Epipremnum aureum</em>. As its name suggests, this low-maintenance vine plant has glossy, marble variegated leaves that cascade downwards. It will make a beautiful hanging feature, as it can be draped from baskets and pots. (15-25cm)</li>\n<li>1 x Heartleaf Philodendron – native to central America and the Caribbean, the <em>Philodendron hederaceum</em> is a fast-growing climber with heart-shaped leaves. As it grows upwards but not outwards, you won’t have to worry about trimming it back. (15-20cm)</li>\n</ul><p>Simply enter the code <strong>VVYA4SS6</strong> at the checkout to claim 26% off this collection.</p>\n<p>If you choose the bundle that includes pots, you’ll also receive three 13cm pots in either Bettona Dark Grey or Stone Dark Grey – just use the code <strong>VUZEDB3Z</strong> to get 23% off this set.</p>\n<p>Oxy-Plants’ e-gift vouchers are a thoughtful way to treat the gardener in your life.
