The charger's base is made from a plastic material and comes in either black or white. It's not the most high quality charger that I've used, but I think it looks fine on a desk or table, blending in well without standing out.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-on-desk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789425\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging puck is similar to Apple's own &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger in design, with that same soft rubber feel, and underneath, the charger has silicone pads to keep it in place on a desk. At the bottom of the base, there's a built-in Qi-based wireless charger that's meant to be used for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>. There's a small hollow where the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> fit, and positioning the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; case within this hollow ensures that it's in the proper position for charging.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-next-to-3-in-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789426\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nEven though the Qi charger at the base is designed for &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, it also works with other iPhones and smartphones that support Qi-based charging. The hollow is bigger and wider than the hollow Belkin added for the 3-in-1 charger, but it still works for iPhones of all sizes. This base charger is limited to 5W though, so it's not going to charge anything at high speeds.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-two-iphones.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3489\" height=\"2618\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789427\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe main &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging puck is identical to Apple's charging options and it charges the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max at 15W. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a> maxes out at 12W, which the 2-in-1 charger also accommodates. The 2-in-1 charger is weighted a bit, but you do need to use a grab and twist gesture to undock an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> without lifting the charger itself. I've had no problems with this, and just giving that small twist when pulling up keeps it on my desk where it belongs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers you need to make sure you have the appropriate power adapter, which is not included, but there's no guesswork involved with the Boost Charge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charger Stand because it comes with a power adapter.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-power-adapter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1254\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789424\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe circular base of the Belkin 2-in-1 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger doesn't take up too much room on a desk (it's about 5.3 inches at its widest point), which I appreciate, and the upright &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging arm can be used in either portrait or landscape mode. The charging arm is angled slightly to put the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in an ideal position for watching videos, taking <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls, or glancing over to see the time at night.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe 2-in-1 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger comes in either black or white, and there's a small LED light on the base that lights up when the Qi-based charger is in use so you know if charging is happening. There's no need for a light for the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging puck because the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; connects magnetically and automatically gets oriented in the right position.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-with-airpods.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789429\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can use the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger with a naked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or with a MagSafe-compatible case, but because it's magnetic, it does not work with non-MagSafe cases or with non-iPhone 12 models because they don't have the necessary built-in magnets.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn my testing, Belkin's 2-in-1 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger charged my &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; from dead to 62 percent in an hour while also charging the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; at 5W, which is just about the same charging speed that I tend to get from a standard Apple &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger. It should be noted, though, that charging with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; is variable, both with this Belkin charger and Apple's standard charger.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn some tests I get around 60 percent battery life in an hour from dead, but in other tests, battery life can be closer to 70 percent, so your actual charging speeds may vary somewhat. What I can say, though, is that the Belkin charger seems to be charging right at the same speeds as a standard &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger, even when charging another device too.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's standard &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger is &#36;39, which means the 2-in-1 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger from Belkin is &#36;60 more expensive. Not everyone is going to want to pay that price, but for those who are fully investing in the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; product lineup, it could be worth the cost.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/belkin-charger-desktop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789428\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nI prefer Belkin's upright charging options to the standard Apple &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger because they're just more convenient to use. It's easier to grab an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; off a desk from the charging arm than it is to grab one from the flat charger, and there's also space for charging &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; or another device with the Qi charging base. All-in-one charging options save space and require fewer cables, which is a bonus.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the future there may be more &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging options to choose from, but right now you're only going to get the fastest speeds from Apple-approved accessories like the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger and Belkin's options. You can get a much cheaper magnetic charger from a third-party company, but those cheaper chargers are limited to 7.5W rather than 15W and aren't worth it for those who want the faster &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging speeds.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>How to Buy</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Belkin 2-in-1 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger can be<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPL62ZM/A/belkin-boostâ†‘chargeTM-pro-2-in-1-wireless-charger-stand-with-magsafe\">purchased from the Apple website for &#36;99.95</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-accessories/\">MagSafe Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/belkin-2-in-1-magsafe-charger/\">Review: Belkin&#039;s &#36;99 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger is Perfect for an iPhone 12 and AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-belkins-99-2-in-1-magsafe-charger-is-perfect-for-an-iphone-12-and-airpods.2288672/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZGERCdTHLQE:2ctaC02wiqo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZGERCdTHLQE:2ctaC02wiqo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZGERCdTHLQE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ac61f4e8e423d9faf03163f2db433fc299ced6dd1ac373c218b24700ddd88c4d","category":"Apple"}
