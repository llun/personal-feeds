Over the last few hours, Twitter has been bombarded with users reporting the issue, with no fix currently available. Snapchat, at the time of writing, has not yet pulled the update and says it is working on a fix. The fix will likely come in the form of a new ‌App Store‌ version.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSnapchat users on previous versions of Snapchat for iOS should be clear of any app crashes. For users impacted by the latest update, be sure to keep the app up to date by periodically checking the ‌App Store‌ for any updates or by enabling automatic ‌App Store‌ updates within Settings. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Snapchat has released an updated version of its app on the ‌App Store‌ that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1409653642173435908\">solves the crashing bug</a>. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snapchat/\">Snapchat</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/snapchat-app-store-update-crashing/\">Snapchat Aware of Latest App Store Update Causing App Crash, Promises Fix Soon [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/snapchat-aware-of-latest-app-store-update-causing-app-crash-promises-fix-soon-updated.2302574/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=T2PHM8wW8G4:wCMhPxaHR6k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=T2PHM8wW8G4:wCMhPxaHR6k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/T2PHM8wW8G4\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"312a89b9e97243f22bce8cb05461739cbf0895091369ca55dd68584ca854a7f4","category":"Apple"}
