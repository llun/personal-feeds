[credit:\n                        THQ Nordic                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>2021 has been a bountiful year for a select group of retro console gamers—specifically, fans of <em>Goldeneye 007</em>. Earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/ex-rare-devs-open-up-about-the-canceled-goldeneye-007-remake-for-xbox-360/\">found and confirmed a leak of the N64 classic</a> as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/leaked-goldeneye-007-documentary-suggests-it-nearly-launched-on-xbox-after-all/\">secretly remade</a> for Xbox 360 consoles (it's even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/we-have-finally-played-the-lost-official-goldeneye-007-remaster-for-xbox-360/\">playable</a> on both real hardware and emulators). Today, the same thing applies to a different game from some of <em>Goldeneye 007</em>'s original creators: <em>TimeSplitters 2</em>.</p>\n<p>The story began with an offhand comment on Twitter this weekend from British programmer Matt Phillips, who had worked on the 2016 video game <em>Homefront: The Revolution</em>. As a nod to the Easter holiday, Phillips piled onto a Twitter thread about long-lost Easter eggs inside of video games, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigevilboss/status/1378688148855795719\">his was a doozy</a>: He had put a \"fully playable, native 4K port of <em>TimeSplitters 2</em>\" into a five-year-old game without anybody realizing it.</p>\n<p>If you've played <em>H:TR</em>, you may have seen a <em>TS2</em>-branded arcade cabinet toward the end of the game. Walk up to it and activate it, and that 2002 game will boot up, albeit in bite-sized form. Only its first two levels are playable, and only in single-player mode. But as it turns out, Phillips put most of the older game's native content into that cabinet, all locked away with some debug codes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755846#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755846&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73b49065044d4e32868ab826aaa5a6b48b404858aff4bc8a4917e53a260d222f","category":"Tech"}
