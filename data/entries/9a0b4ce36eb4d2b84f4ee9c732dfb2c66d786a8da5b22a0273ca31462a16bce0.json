The agency expects to have a draft of its guidance in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>The announcement suggests that makers of authorized vaccines will not be required to submit reams of data from large, months-long clinical trials, as they did for their initial authorizations. Still, data on any altered vaccine—however pared down—would still have to be enough to convince FDA scientists that a next-generation shot is safe and effective against variants. Vaccine alterations may include changes to the initial vaccine design or additions of new vaccine components, the FDA said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740187#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740187&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9a0b4ce36eb4d2b84f4ee9c732dfb2c66d786a8da5b22a0273ca31462a16bce0","category":"Tech"}
