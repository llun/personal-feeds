This has gone back almost a decade in fact, with all sorts of drones at varying levels of automated tracking capabilities.</p>\n<p>And while tracking is getting better and better, the controller portion of the situation has actually varied a bit over the years. For example, until about 18 months ago, you could use your phone to control most DJI drones (without a controller). Then they stopped doing that, thus increasing the complexity of using their drones for solo-sport recording.</p>\n<p>Prior to Skydio (R1 or V2), <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/04/airdog-action-sports-drone-in-depth-review.html\">there was Airdog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2017/07/airdog-adii-2nd-gen-sports-tracking-drone.html\">Airdog 2</a>. They had a nifty little card-sized remote controller you strapped on your arm. It worked surprisingly well, though the drone didn’t have obstacle avoidance. Then there <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/03/skydio-r1-autonomous-sports-drone-in-depth-review.html\">was Skydio R1</a>, which you could get in the air with your phone, and from there it’d use machine learning to track you autonomously. But if it lost you due to a tree in the way, you were up crap-creek. <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/12/skydio-autonomous-sports.html\">So for the R2 drone</a> they added a nifty sport-friendly remote control as a backup transmission method. I find it fiddly to use, but it does the job.</p>\n<p>However, as great as the Skydio drones are for sport (really, they’re incredible) – they’re not terribly great for non-sport footage or still photography. And it’s not so much the quality (which is fine), but rather the lack of all the other features that DJI has that make it a more cohesive non-sport aerial cinematography platform. But with DJI’s recent drones requiring the remote controller (plus a phone attached to it), I’ve had to get pretty darn creative to have a controller on my handlebars.</p>\n<p>I’ve rubber banded remote controls to my handlebars, I even cut out a <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2016/03/wahoo-elemnt-gps-bike-computer-in-depth-review.html\">Wahoo ELEMNT bike computer box</a> one day to use as a little safety shell for it…and then stuck that in my bag, easily accessible. Seriously, I’ve done all the wonkiness things to make this work. But back in February a DCR reader spotted a solution for me – a ~$20 bike mount for DJI controllers (sorry to whomever it was, I can’t seem to find your e-mail/name!):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/04/vlcsnap-2021-04-02-16h22m07s001.png\"><img src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/04/vlcsnap-2021-04-02-16h22m07s001_thumb.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>It costs about $18-$25 depending on where in the world you are, and is listed under a dozen different companies.</p>\n<p>Thus, I’ve been giving it a whirl lately. And the below video is my trials and tribulations with that mount:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, once I made some modifications to it – it’s working great. Interestingly, there are also other variants for other DJI models. In my case, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tineer-Controller-Bicycle-Accessory-Stabilizer/dp/B08JV4JMTV?dchild=1&amp;keywords=DJI+Mavic+Air+2+Bike+Mount&amp;qid=1617372965&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=328fbb8567eba2b40db1f5b9e523afab&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">I was using the one for the DJI Mavic Air 2</a>, which shares the same controller as the DJI Mini 2. The other <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=DJI+Controller+Drone+Bike+Mount&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=dcr07-20&amp;linkId=eb8ec427214f1dac54ec438a93586ee4&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\">variants use the exact same bike-mount portion</a> (such as for the Mavic 2 Pro/Zoom, etc…), just with different upper-controller clips.</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you wanted to see how these drones track (pre-mount), check out this video:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In any case – I’ve got a stack of non-drone things for next week I’ve been putting the finishing touches on.</p>\n<p>With that – have a great weekend everyone!</p>\n<div>\n<h3>Found This Post Useful?
