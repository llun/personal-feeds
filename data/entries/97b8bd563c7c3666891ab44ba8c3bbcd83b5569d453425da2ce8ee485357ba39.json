Aurora says it's aiming to have a fleet of Sienna prototypes ready for testing on public roads by the end of the year. Denso, a major Japanese auto parts manufacturer, will also contribute to the project.</p>\n<p>It's a significant win for Aurora, which has struggled to figure out its business model in a fast-changing industry. A couple of years ago, Aurora's plan was to supply self-driving software and sensors to auto-making incumbents. The company had a partnership with Volkswagen that was supposed to lead to Aurora's technology being incorporated into Volkswagen's vehicles, with plans to launch a self-driving taxi service. But the two companies <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/06/volkswagen-snubs-self-driving-startup-aurora-eyes-ford-partnership/\">parted ways</a> in 2019, calling Aurora's strategy into question. Aurora did <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/06/hyundai-self-driving-deal-points-to-industry-wide-pattern/\">sign an investment deal</a> with Hyundai around the same time, but they've said little about that relationship since then.</p>\n\n<p>Later in 2019, Aurora <a href=\"https://medium.com/aurora-blog/moving-towards-a-commercial-product-auroras-vehicles-hit-texas-roads-b10102b51697\">pivoted to long-haul trucking</a> as the first application for its self-driving technology. Some consider trucking to be an attractive market for a self-driving startup because freeways are a relatively simple environment for software to understand. Last month, Aurora <a href=\"https://aurora.tech/blog/aurora-is-teaming-up-with-paccar-to-deploy-self-driving-trucks\">announced a partnership</a> with truck maker PACCAR to build self-driving semi trucks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740628#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740628&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
