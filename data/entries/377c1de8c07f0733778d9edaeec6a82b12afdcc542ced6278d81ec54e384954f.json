SyFy canceled the series earlier this year, although showrunner Emily Andras has not ruled out the possibility of additional seasons, should the series find a new US distributor. But for now, we must bid a fond farewell to the boozily irreverent, tough-yet-vulnerable protector of the fictional town of Purgatory.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for prior seasons below. All major S4 spoilers are below the second gallery. We'll give you a heads-up when we get there.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/earpers-rejoice-wynonna-earp-s4-has-a-new-killer-trailer-and-an-airdate/\">we've reported previously</a>, the series is based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynonna_Earp\">comic book series</a> created by Beau Smith in 1996. Wynonna (Melanie Scrofano) takes on \"revenants,\" the repeatedly reincarnated outlaws that Wyatt Earp killed. They won't stay dead until the Earp heir—Wynonna—offs them with Wyatt's famous 16-inch-barrel revolver, dubbed Peacemaker. Over the course of four seasons, she has battled witches, vampires, vengeful spirits, nutty sister-wife cults, possessed neighbors, demonic nuns, and killer trees, among other threats. She is not without allies, however, including the immortal being, Doc Holliday (Tim Rozon), with whom Wynonna becomes romantically entangled (and yes, it's complicated). Then there is her baby sister, Waverly (Dominique Provost-Chalkley), who falls for local deputy Nicole Haught (Katherine Barrell)—a popular pairing dubbed \"Wayhaught\" by shippers—and the local sheriff, Nedley (Greg Lawson), who becomes a father figure and demon-hunting ally. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1702105#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1702105&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"377c1de8c07f0733778d9edaeec6a82b12afdcc542ced6278d81ec54e384954f","category":"Tech"}
