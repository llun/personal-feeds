With each headset using a total of six Fresnel lenses (one stack of three per eye), Kuo says Apple will use lightweight plastic lenses with customized materials and coatings to match the light transmission of glass.<blockquote>The purpose of this design is to improve FOV and reduce weight and thickness. We believe that Apple will use a hybrid Fresnel lens design further to enhance the Fresnel lens's optical performance (e.g., improve vignetting and optical artifacts), and each hybrid Fresnel lens comprises three stacked Fresnel lenses.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWe believe that Apple's design will achieve a better balance between HMD’s FOV and form factor.</blockquote>The lightweight lenses are said to be primarily supplied by Young Optics with Genius Electronic Optical also pitching in, but they won't come cheaply and will contribute to a high overall price for the headset that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/apple-mixed-reality-headset-features-report/\">some rumors</a> have pegged as in the &#36;3,000 range.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo and other sources have claimed that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/\">multiple mixed-reality products</a> in its pipeline, starting with this initial headset rumored for a mid-2022 debut. A much smaller and lighter set of augmented reality glasses is rumored for around 2025. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tf-international-securities/\">TF International Securities</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-150-grams/\">Kuo: Apple Aiming to Keep Mixed Reality Headset&#039;s Weight Under 150 Grams</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-aiming-to-keep-mixed-reality-headsets-weight-under-150-grams.2289274/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mHlpW1V5uSg:_F8g_eZhexA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mHlpW1V5uSg:_F8g_eZhexA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mHlpW1V5uSg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6421259f38e691e964e324d18dc4800cedad0cea9f534b7f4de36df3d61cbd34","category":"Apple"}
