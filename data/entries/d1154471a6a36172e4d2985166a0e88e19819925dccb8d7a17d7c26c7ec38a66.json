{"title":"Hello Weather","link":"https://helloweather.com/","date":1619828128000,"content":"\n<p>Longtime readers know I have a thing for good iPhone weather apps. I find weather apps to be an evergreen playground for design ideas — and that’s more true than ever now with iOS 14 widgets. One of my very favorites in recent years is Hello Weather. It’s attractive, original, and highly useful. (Good iPad support too.) Free to download and use, but they’ve got a Pro tier that unlocks even more, like Apple Watch complications and additional data sources. No ads, and their privacy nutrition label simply states: “Data Not Collected”. Highly recommended.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/30/hello-weather\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d1154471a6a36172e4d2985166a0e88e19819925dccb8d7a17d7c26c7ec38a66","category":"Tech"}
