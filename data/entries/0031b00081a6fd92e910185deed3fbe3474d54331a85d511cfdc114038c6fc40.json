It also allows 3T to take full control of the production process, and to be more flexible and provide shorter lead times on production runs.</p>\n<p>To prove the concept, it was deemed necessary to begin with the very top of the range, the top-spec <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/3t-exploro-racemax/\">Exploro gravel bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Like most carbon bikes, current 3T models are manufactured in Asia using carbon sheets pre-impregnated with resin (‘pre-preg’), which are laid up and baked in moulds.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 3T has chosen filament winding over more common carbon production techniques.</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<p>Rather than simply reproduce this approach in Italy, 3T has opted for filament wound carbon, a process that involves spinning carbon yarn onto cores to form shapes.</p>\n<p>This has the potential to offer great control over production, and it’s an approach we’ve seen other brands experiment with, for example, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/this-carbon-spoked-wheelset-presents-a-totally-new-revolution-in-wheel-tech/\">Hunt with its carbon wheels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-giant-tcr/\">Giant with the latest generation TCR</a>.</p>\n<p>3T has apparently built its own filament winding machines, and these use dry carbon fibres rather than pre-preg.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 3T is using dry carbon fibres rather than pre-preg for a number of reasons.</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<p>Vroomen explains that while pre-preg carbon needs to be placed in a cold mould to prevent early activation of the resin, before being heated, dry fibres can be placed directly in a hot mould, into which resin is then injected.</p>\n<p>Avoiding this cycle of heating and cooling saves both time and energy, and a further benefit of dry fibres is the great choice of fibre grades available from suppliers, so there’s more potential for 3T to tune its lay-ups to suit the requirements of specific designs.</p>\n<p>3T says frames and components made this way require little or no finishing out of the mould.</p>\n<p>In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/cranksets/3t-torno-ltd-1x-aero-crankset-long-term-review/\">3T Torno crank</a> released in 2018 was a proof-of-concept for the resin injection technique, although this was pre-moulded rather than filament wound.</p>\n<h2>3T Exploro RaceMax Italia Founders Edition</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/3t-jumps-the-gravel-gravy-train-with-first-ever-bike-and-two-new-wheelsets/\">Exploro</a> was the first explicitly aero gravel bike and it’s been a hugely influential design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>3T</i></span></div>\n<p>Bikes were always the end goal, and 3T says it began development of the in-house Exploro in 2019, aiming to make a frameset lighter than the standard <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/3t-exploro-racemax-review/\">Exploro RaceMax</a>, but just as stiff and strong.</p>\n<p>One hundred Exploro RaceMax Italias will be made, with production beginning this month. While frameset number one is going in 3T’s museum, the other 99 will be available to buy if you’ve got very deep pockets.</p>\n<p>The frameset includes a seatpost, an engraved metal limited-edition plaque, custom “see-through” paint options, the customer’s name under the clearcoat, and a choice of a 1× plus 2× frame, or one that’s 1×-only.</p>","author":"Matthew Loveridge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0031b00081a6fd92e910185deed3fbe3474d54331a85d511cfdc114038c6fc40","category":"Cycling"}
