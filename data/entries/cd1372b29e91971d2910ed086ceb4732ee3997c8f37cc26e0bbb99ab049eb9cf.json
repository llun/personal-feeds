{"title":"Next iPad Pro to Feature Both Wireless Charging and Reverse Wireless Charging Capabilities","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/","date":1622781858000,"content":"Apple is developing a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> that will feature wireless charging capabilities, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/apple-working-on-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini\">Bloomberg</a></em>. The upcoming ‌iPad Pro‌ will debut in 2022, following the updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> 11 and 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models that launched in May 2021. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPad-Pro-USB-C-Feature-Purple-Cyan-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the new ‌iPad Pro‌, Apple is testing a glass back instead of an aluminum enclosure, which would allow for the wireless charging capabilities. Apple first implemented wireless charging with the glass-backed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 8, ‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus, and ‌iPhone‌ X in 2017, and every flagship ‌iPhone‌ since then has supported wireless charging.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCurrent iPads still charge over USB-C or Lightning, but enabling wireless charging would bring the ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> closer in functionality. Work on the new ‌iPad Pro‌ is still in the early stages, and <em>Bloomberg</em> warns that Apple's plans could change or be canceled before next year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMost wireless chargers are sized for the ‌iPhone‌, so a wireless charging feature for the ‌iPad‌ might require specialized charging options, but Apple is rumored to be planning to use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> if it does indeed opt for wireless charging for the ‌iPad Pro‌. Wireless charging will likely be slower than charging through the USB-C/Thunderbolt port, which is expected.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also working on reverse wireless charging for the new ‌iPad Pro‌, which would allow users to charge their iPhones, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, and other accessories by laying them on the back of the ‌iPad‌. There were rumors that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> would feature bilateral wireless charging, but it didn't ultimately happen. <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Apple did indeed explore the feature for the ‌iPhone‌, however. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlong with ‌MagSafe‌ charging for the ‌iPad‌ and reverse wireless charging capabilities, Apple is still working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/apple-developing-airpower-like-charger/\">future wireless charging solution</a> that works similarly to the abandoned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a> charger, but it's not clear if and when such a product might launch. For further in the future, Apple is investigating long-range wireless charging methods that work at greater distances than a standard inductive charging solution.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wireless-charging/\">wireless charging</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/\">Next iPad Pro to Feature Both Wireless Charging and Reverse Wireless Charging Capabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-pro-to-feature-both-wireless-charging-and-reverse-wireless-charging-capabilities.2299145/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y13glNBMtfQ:9JPj6bzkxVk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y13glNBMtfQ:9JPj6bzkxVk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Y13glNBMtfQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cd1372b29e91971d2910ed086ceb4732ee3997c8f37cc26e0bbb99ab049eb9cf","category":"Apple"}
