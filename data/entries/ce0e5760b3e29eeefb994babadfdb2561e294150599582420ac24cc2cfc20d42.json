{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win a Maxed Out iPad Air and a Copy of WALTR PRO From Softorino","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/21/macrumors-giveaway-waltr-pro/","date":1621620100000,"content":"For this week's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/giveaway/\">giveaway</a>, we've teamed up with <a href=\"https://softorino.com/\">Softorino</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a fully upgraded <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and a <a href=\"https://softorino.com/waltr/\">copy of WALTR PRO</a> to go along with it.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/waltr-pro.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWALTR PRO is the third iteration of the popular WALTR app that's designed to make it easy to get any file from your computer onto an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/\">iPod touch</a>. It's fantastic for transferring photos, videos, music, and more with an intuitive drag and drop format.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $29.99, WALTR PRO is available for both Windows and macOS. It supports files of any kind and has a built-in converter so you don't even need to think about file types -- WALTR PRO handles everything for you, turning files into Apple-compatible versions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFile conversion happens automatically when uploading something to an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌, but you can also drag and drop to convert media files locally and save them to your internal or external drive in an Apple-friendly format.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/waltr-pro-main-interface.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new version of the app includes an upgraded version of the Automatic Content Recognition tool, which is designed to scan your files and add appropriate metadata like album names or movie titles. Users can now manually edit all metadata before files are transferred so everything's perfect the first time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/waltr-pro-metadata-edit.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original WALTR app has been great for transferring music and videos to an iOS device, but WALTR PRO takes it a step further and offers up control over <em>where</em> files are transferred, so you can choose specific apps. If you import a video, for example, you can choose to transfer it right to VLC. Holding down the Option key will let users choose a target app after dragging a file into the WALTR PRO window.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/waltr-pro-transfer-to-app.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWALTR PRO can be used to add music files to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, and with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> enabled the content uploaded is backed up and able to be played directly from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWALTR PRO has always been a useful alternative to iTunes for getting content from a Mac or PC to an iOS device, and now that iTunes has been retired, it's even more useful. It's easily one of the most hassle-free ways to initiate file transfers for those who need to manually transfer movies, videos, documents, PDFs, and more to the ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/waltr-pro-drag-and-drop.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSoftorino is providing a 256GB ‌iPad Air‌ in the color of the winner's choice, with the winner able to choose a WiFi or a WiFi + Cellular model and engraving if desired. The winner will also get a free copy of WALTR PRO Family Pack for either macOS or Windows.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo enter to win, use the Gleam.io widget below and enter an email address.
