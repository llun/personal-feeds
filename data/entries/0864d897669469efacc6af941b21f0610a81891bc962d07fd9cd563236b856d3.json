I don’t need the disappointments to be at a higher level.</p>\n<p>‘At the Rio Olympics, for example, it was not the crash that made me come back stronger. It’s always annoying that people say that I came back because of the crash. At that time I was motivated and I showed there that I was one of the best climbers in the world.</p>\n<p>‘So this gave me energy and made me eager and hungry to continue to get even stronger, train harder and focus more on climbing.’</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think that’s the secret as to why I am stronger than my competitors – it’s because I dare to search for my limits and go out of my comfort zone</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fast-forward to 2020 and at the age of 38 Annemiek finished the year as the top-ranked rider in the women’s UCI world rankings. Although she failed to retain her World Road Race Championships title at Imola, she was racing with a broken wrist and still managed to finish second.</p>\n<p>A year earlier, her 2019 title came after a 105km solo breakaway on hilly Yorkshire roads that drew comparisons to Eddy Merckx in his pomp back in the 1960s and 1970s – the kind of dominant performance we seldom see nowadays.</p>\n<p>Clearly Annemiek is not afraid to push the limits. On the back of that dominant Worlds performance in Yorkshire, she embarked on a cycling tour with some of the male pros in her former Mitchelton-Scott team, including Adam and Simon Yates, riding 1,800km from Portugal to Andalusia in Spain.</p>\n<p>Although she says this training was beneficial, Annemiek is clear that it wasn’t that she was training with men per se that made her stronger.</p>\n<p>‘Training with guys is overrated. I did a total of eight days with Mitchelton-Scott. And this year at the training camp with [new team] Movistar, it was just nice to join them for three or four days.</p>\n<p>‘But it’s not training with guys that is the secret to having good results. I think it’s more a sign that I am not scared to go out of my comfort zone. For sure, joining the guys can be a bit scary. They go a bit faster than I want, and I cannot tell them to slow down – they need to train too.</p>\n<p>‘But you have to search for your limits, and that’s something the guys can help me with. I think that’s the secret as to why I am stronger than my competitors – it’s because I dare to search for my limits and go out of my comfort zone. Riding with the guys is just an example of that.’</p>\n<p>So where does Annemiek get her grit, determination and ability to deal with setbacks from? Watch footage of the closing kilometres of that epic Worlds win in Yorkshire and you’ll see Annemiek pointing at the earrings she was wearing as the camera zoomed in on her. These were an 18th birthday gift from her father, and she is known to wear what she calls her ‘lucky earrings’ at big races.</p>\n<p>‘My dad died in 2008 after a long illness, and I had to deal with that, and see my mother cope with her loss,’ Annemiek says. ‘My parents showed a lot of strength mentally, and I have taken my inspiration from them.’</p>\n<p><strong>Find the rest of <a href=\"/tags/zwift-womens-history-month\"><em>Cyclist's 31 Inspirational Women</em></a> here</strong></p>\n<p>As a result, whenever Annemiek wins a big race she always shares that celebration with her mother.</p>\n<p>This year’s goal is to compete in the rescheduled time-trial and road race at the Tokyo Olympics. Annemiek is preparing for that and the Women’s WorldTour season with her new teammates at Movistar.</p>\n<p>Based on her 2020 performances and her unfinished business from the Rio Games in 2016, we wouldn’t be surprised to see more outstanding performances this year from this extraordinary athlete.</p>\n<p><strong>For more from Zwift this International Women's Month</strong>, <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5632398478&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">visit here</a>. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/cyclists\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Cyclists</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"0864d897669469efacc6af941b21f0610a81891bc962d07fd9cd563236b856d3","category":"Cycling"}
