The InternationElles have had enough. These ten female cyclists and three crews from across the globe, are united in the fight for equality. Their hope is through activism, that they can boost women’s cycling. Right now, they have a <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/equal-prize-money-for-the-womens-peloton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoFundMe</a> to raise €5,000 as equal prize money to the top 5 women&#8217;s podium for the upcoming 2021 Strade Bianche. The above illustration might seem like an exaggeration but the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CL1jDUKFH8Q/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">payout at the recent Omloop Het Nieuwsblad</a> paints a clear and concise picture&#8230;</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the UCI, USAC, and other organizations will get with the times. </p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"898c3348824839cf0ae1b93c722262cc16d69ac09d2f434840aeac7b36896809","category":"Cycling"}
