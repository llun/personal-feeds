After weeks of speculation, the China National Space Administration <a href=\"http://www.cnsa.gov.cn/n6758823/n6758838/c6811999/content.html\">confirmed</a> that the country will seek to land the mission, including its \"Zhurong\" rover, sometime between 23:00 UTC on Friday, May 14 and May 19.</p>\n<p>Named after an ancient fire god in Chinese mythology, the Zhurong rover has a mass of about 240 kg. This means the Chinese rover is comparable in size to the Spirit and Opportunity rovers that NASA landed on Mars in January 2004.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot of intrigue surrounding the high-risk mission. Before this mission, China had never sent a spacecraft to Mars. In this single spacecraft, the country packed both an orbiter and a modest-sized lander with a rover. Moreover, no country other than the United States has successfully soft-landed a spacecraft on Mars or deployed a rover. Other countries have tried and failed multiple times.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765111#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7451be8e600cf578bbf46f317693d03b13ceab7eaccd14f9e34b91dabe22e49d","category":"Tech"}
