For what it's worth, Google Earth has long offered an interactive 3D globe of the Earth on Intel-based Macs both on the web and in an app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is currently in the midst of a two-year transition from Intel processors to its custom Apple silicon chips in Macs, with the changeover slated to be completed by WWDC 2022. Macs with the M1 chip have proven to be much faster than their equivalent Intel-based predecessors, with even the base model MacBook Air with the M1 chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/11/m1-macbook-air-first-benchmark/\">outperforming a maxed-out Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> in benchmarks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is widely rumored to be planning <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> powered by a faster iteration of the M1 chip for later this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nmacOS Monterey is still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-compatibility/\">compatible with a wide variety of Intel-based Macs</a>, and is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-1/\">available now in beta for developers</a>. The software update will likely be publicly released to all users at some point between September and November.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> According to Rene Ritchie, Intel-based Macs lack the Neural Engine that many if not all of these features require.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>It’s because Intel Macs don’t have the neural engine these features require. M1 is an A14X+. T2 is an A10 (pre-ANE). T1 was an S2 (watch SiP). Previous Intel Macs had nothing. These features all lean on the neural engine. <a href=\"https://t.co/jxqB7LsR2Q\">https://t.co/jxqB7LsR2Q</a></p>— Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1402677344951803906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-features-for-m1-macs-only/\">Several macOS Monterey Features Unavailable on Intel-Based Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/several-macos-monterey-features-unavailable-on-intel-based-macs.2300086/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=obJiDit7xrM:Vpo3X5HtA-M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=obJiDit7xrM:Vpo3X5HtA-M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/obJiDit7xrM\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"14ce146d44b65e9be7819d8acb984d03e4382c31b2ac783207afff9566b75e7c","category":"Apple"}
