He&#8217;s more interested in bombing fast descents at breakneck speed and having a blast in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike messenger and fixed-gear crit racer has made a name for himself with his hair-raising videos, not least his Descent Disciples series, which includes the truly bonkers video you can see below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Descent Disciples ||Vol 9|| TUNA\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJSpgRIVw78?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Safa&#8217;s latest film is called &#8216;Pray for Speed&#8217; and it documents a roadtrip he took through Southern California in search of the fastest descents in the area. You can see the film at the top of this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We definitely wouldn&#8217;t recommend following in Safa&#8217;s tyre tracks when you&#8217;re descending, but there&#8217;s something engaging about watching such a skilled (and fearless) descender tip the bike over in search of maximum speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safa is releasing a standalone, full-descent video for each of the three descents featured in &#8216;Pray for Speed&#8217;. The first of those, from Mt. San Jacinto, can be found below. The others will follow in the next week or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"PRAY FOR SPEED | The Descents: Mt.
