There were multiple complaints about the usability of the app, which Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/11/ios-14-6-tweaks-podcasts-app/\">began to address</a> in iOS 14.6. When delaying the Podcast Subscriptions launch, Apple said that further improvements to the Podcasts app are in the works.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts-subscriptions/\">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launching-on-june-15/\">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions Launching on June 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launching-on-june-15.2300100/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yJpIAKrtMSg:l8azh9HHkvQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=yJpIAKrtMSg:l8azh9HHkvQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/yJpIAKrtMSg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bb238d028dcb836948996753456176f87605916484ed548682f10d4ab67f78fa","category":"Apple"}
