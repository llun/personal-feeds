However, a new study from BYU <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721821000607?dgcid=coauthor\">published in\nSleep Health</a> challenges the premise made by phone manufacturers\nand found that the Night Shift functionality does not actually\nimprove sleep.</p>\n\n<p>To test the theory, BYU psychology professor Chad Jensen and\nresearchers from the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center\ncompared the sleep outcomes of individuals in three categories:\nthose who used their phone at night with the Night Shift function\nturned on, those who used their phone at night without Night Shift\nand those who did not use a smartphone before bed at all.</p>\n\n<p>“In the whole sample, there were no differences across the three\ngroups,” Jensen said. “Night Shift is not superior to using your\nphone without Night Shift or even using no phone at all.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/03/28/fleishman-night-shift\">My theory all along</a> has been that Night Shift just makes your screen look hideously mis-colored. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/04/byu-night-shift\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3ea12db47f041c437df85d81d3bbd9f06a980cefe077599be85804a3b6795232","category":"Tech"}
