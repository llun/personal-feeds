Apple's online store should become available again when the event has concluded, likely with new products and accessories available to order.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-store-down-banner.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe event will consist of a pre-recorded video with Apple executives speaking from locations around the company's Apple Park headquarters in California. Apple is widely expected to introduce new iPads at the event, including a new iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display, and there could be a few other surprises in store, such as Apple's long-awaited AirTags item trackers or a redesigned iMac with Apple silicon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis week could also mark the final release of iOS 14.5 following over two months of beta testing, so we could hear about this during the event. The software update is packed with new features, including the ability for iPhone users who are wearing an Apple Watch to unlock the iPhone with Face ID while wearing a mask.<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-to-expect-apple-event-april-20/\">What to Expect From the 'Spring Loaded' Apple Event: New iPads, AirTags, and More</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-event-april-2021/\">How to Watch the 'Spring Loaded' Apple Event</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everything-new-in-ios-14-5-beta/\">Everything New in iOS 14.5</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMacRumors will have in-depth coverage of Apple's event across our platforms, including a live blog on our website and live tweets via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">@MacRumorsLive on Twitter</a>, so be sure to follow along later today to keep track of everything announced.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/april-2021-event/\">April 2021 event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-store-down-spring-loaded-event/\">Apple Store Goes Down Ahead of 'Spring Loaded' Event Later Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-goes-down-ahead-of-spring-loaded-event-later-today.2292290/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LALHnP6aaQ8:m6hMa0mDTRo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LALHnP6aaQ8:m6hMa0mDTRo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LALHnP6aaQ8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c75725f64b8d5866deed44336f631b3fdba8c25573eb8b9d068f29b739d2fdb2","category":"Apple"}
