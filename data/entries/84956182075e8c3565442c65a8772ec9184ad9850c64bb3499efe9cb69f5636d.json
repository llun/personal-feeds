{"title":"Apple Pay Launches in Mexico","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-pay-launches-in-mexico/","date":1614077041000,"content":"Apple today officially released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> in Mexico, offering users the ability to easily pay with their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, and online on their Macs with supporting banks.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/apple-pay-mexico-webpage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1248\" height=\"995\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-764142\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs of now, Citibanamex and Banorte are the only two banks that we're aware of supporting &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;. American Express and MasterCard support is also present. The list is likely much longer and banks will make the announcement to their customers in the coming hours. We'll update this post with new information as it becomes available.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLast year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/search/?s=Apple+Pay+Mexico\">updated</a> the &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; webpage on its Mexican site to say the feature would not be available until 2021. The small correction <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/05/apple-pay-expanding-to-mexico/\">came after reports</a> in March that users in Mexico were beginning to see &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; prompts within the Wallet app on their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple users and customers of supporting banks can go to the Wallet app on their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to add their credit/debit card for easy and contactless payments. The card can also be synced with an Apple Watch for easier, contactless wrist payments.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mexico/\">Mexico</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-pay-launches-in-mexico/\">Apple Pay Launches in Mexico</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-launches-in-mexico.2285864/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ib-CF7_BhGM:coMhRudBpC4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ib-CF7_BhGM:coMhRudBpC4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Ib-CF7_BhGM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"84956182075e8c3565442c65a8772ec9184ad9850c64bb3499efe9cb69f5636d","category":"Apple"}
