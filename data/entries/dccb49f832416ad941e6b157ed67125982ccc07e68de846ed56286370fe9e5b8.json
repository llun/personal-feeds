{"title":"Tour de France 2021 Stage 9 Preview - The hardest climb so far","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021-stage-9-preview","date":1625237739000,"content":"\n      <p>Stage 9 of the Tour de France will take in five categorised climbs in the Alps and the first .HC category ascent of the race – that makes for a demanding day. The stage finishes atop the monstrous Monteé de Tignes which is over 20km in length. <br /><br />The mountain was used at the 2007 Tour de France, where Michael Rasmussen conquered the climb, allowing the Dane to move into the yellow jersey after starting stage 8 in 39th place.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\"><b><i>Tour de France 2021 Guide</i></b></a></p>\n<h4><b>Route</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_PROFILS_ETAPES_SANS_RAVITO_ETP09_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625229688\" />Stage 9 profile</span></i></p>\n<p>After leaving Cluses, the first 17km of the stage are flat. There will be constant attacks to join the breakaway here which means it may not form until the climbs begin. The first climb is the Côte de Domancy, which is short at two and a half kilometres but averages more than 9%, making it a second category climb. The breakaway is more likely to form in this phase of the race.<br /><br />An intermediate sprint occurs at kilometre 32 in Praz-sur-Arly. This is a good chance for Peter Sagan, Sonny Colbrelli and Michael Matthews to gain ground on Mark Cavendish who currently holds the green jersey.</p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_ETP09_PROFILS_PARTICULIERS_CORMET_DE_ROSELEND_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625229741\" /></span></i><i><span>Col du Pré and Cormet de Roselend profile</span></i></p>\n<p>The first-category Col des Saisies is next and is swiftly followed by a long descent. The Col du Pré directly follows which marks the first .HC category climb of the Tour de France this year. The ascent is 12.6km at 7.7% average gradient. Between kilometre 5 and 12 of the climb, the gradient averages just under 9.5%, making it a gruelling effort. There will be little respite afterwards with the Cormet de Roselend peaking 51km from the finish.</p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_ETP09_PROFILS_PARTICULIERS_MONTEE_DE_TIGNES_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625229808\" /></span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>Monteé de Tignes profile</span></i></p>\n<p>A long, 20km descent is next before a short valley section which leads directly into the final climb to Tignes. The Monteé de Tignes is defined by its length rather than steep gradients. The ascent does have an easier section just further than halfway and flattens in the final kilometre, providing two sections of brief respite.<br /><br />By the conclusion of the stage, the riders will have climbed over 4,500m and crossed 2,000m altitude for the first time at the 2021 Tour de France. This means that GC riders will be scattered across the road and a mass reshuffling in the GC standings will take place.</p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1228371640-_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625238015\" />Tadej Pogačar will be looking for big GC gains.

However, after his team were caught out by a large, dangerous breakaway on stage seven to Le Creusot, UAE are weakened. However, Pogačar is one of the strongest climbers of the world and even if he is isolated early, he remains a favourite to win the stage and gain major time on his GC rivals.<br /><br />Jumbo-Visma contributed to the stage 7 drama where among others, <strong>Wout van Aert</strong> joined the mega breakaway. Van Aert started the stage in third overall, just 30 seconds behind Mathieu van der Poel in the yellow jersey. The time he gained there means he is a genuine card that Jumbo-Visma could play in the general classification. He’ll likely leak some time to the pure climbers here, though he proved on the Prati di Tivo at Tirreno-Adriatico earlier this season that he’s no walkover in the mountains. Despite that, <strong>Primož Roglič</strong> remains Jumbo-Visma’s leader and alongside <strong>Jonas Vingegaard</strong>, they should do their utmost to track Pogačar throughout the stage.<br /><br />How will the Ineos Grenadiers approach the stage? Despite the plethora of GC options available to them, they have been unable to make an impression on the general classification so far. <strong>Richard Carapaz</strong> and <strong>Geraint Thomas</strong> are their best placed riders, but <strong>Richie Porte</strong> is further back and <strong>Tao Geoghegan Hart</strong> is completely out of GC contention. They must make their numbers pay, as Jumbo-Visma have done so far, if they are to make an impression on the final GC podium. This could mean sending any of their three remaining leaders up the road early.<br /><br />We will learn more about <strong>Julian Alaphilippe</strong>’s GC ambitions at the Tour de France this year in the Alps. The Frenchman has generally played down his GC chances, but is placed well in the GC and has proven that he can climb well in the past.</p>\n<p>The other GC riders to watch are <strong>Wilco Kelderman, David Gaudu </strong>and<strong> Rigoberto Urán.</strong></p>\n<p>The breakaway will fancy going on to take the stage. <strong>Simon Yates</strong> is one of the strongest climbers at the Tour and isn’t challenging for the general classification, instead choosing to focus on stage victories. <strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> and <strong>Mike Woods</strong> are in a similar position to Yates, meaning they will be allowed to join the breakaway too, so could all prove to be likely stage winners.</p>\n<p>Other riders that could challenge for the stage in the breakaway include <strong>Ion Izagirre, Dan Martin </strong>and<strong> Carlos Verona.</strong></p>\n<p><i>Cover image: </i><i>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"dccb49f832416ad941e6b157ed67125982ccc07e68de846ed56286370fe9e5b8","category":"Cycling"}
