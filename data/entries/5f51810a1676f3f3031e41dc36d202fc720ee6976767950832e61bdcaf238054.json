The unnamed worker specifically highlighted fears about the potential for \"real-world harm,\" including \"stalkers.\"</blockquote>According to the report, Bosworth was quick to emphasize that nothing had yet been decided and that it could well prove that current state laws would make it impossible for Facebook to offer people the ability to search for other people based on the real-world profile of their face.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFollowing the story's publication, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1365072180329865222\">Bosworth took to Twitter</a> to underline the fact that Facebook had been \"open\" about its efforts to develop AR glasses, which he said are \"still in the early stages.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"Face recognition is a hugely controversial topic and for good reason and I was speaking about was how we are going to have to have a very public discussion about the pros and cons,\" said Bosworth, adding in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1365072307526406146?s=20\">follow-up tweet</a>: \"In our meeting today I specifically said the future product would be fine without it but there were some nice use cases if it could be done in a way the public and regulators were comfortable with.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFacebook first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1306278791669579776%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F9%2F16%2F21439929%2Ffacebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement\">publicly spoke</a> about its smart glasses project last year, when it claimed that the product would arrive \"sooner rather than later\" in 2021. The glasses are reportedly being developed in partnership with Ray-Ban, and are expected to go head to head with similar rival products from Snapchat and Amazon. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We’ve been open about our efforts to build AR glasses and are still in the early stages.

The controversy has been amplified by reports of government authorities and private businesses <a href=\"https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6133890195001#sp=show-clips\">exploring the technology</a> as a means of <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/raza-v-city-new-york-legal-challenge-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program\">identifying and tracking civilians</a>, combined with a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/amazon-facial-recognition-orlando-police-department\">lack of federal regulation</a> surrounding its use.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFacial recognition has been implemented in Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app and Apple has used it as a security feature for unlocking iPhones and iPads via biometric authentication. Apple is also working on smart glasses that will augment peoples' real-world perspective with digital features, although its product is still believed to be \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-ar-vr-headset-2022-launch/\">several years away</a>\" from launch, although there is currently no suggestion that Apple intends to use the technology in its rumored AR glasses. Given the company's privacy focus, any such application would be highly unlikely to resemble the kind that Facebook appears to be exploring.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFor more information on Apple's rumored smart glasses, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">check out our dedicated guide</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/augmented-reality/\">augmented reality</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/27/facebook-facial-recognition-smart-glasses-legal/\">Facebook Weighing Up Legality of Facial Recognition in Upcoming Smart Glasses</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-weighing-up-legality-of-facial-recognition-in-upcoming-smart-glasses.2286429/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_-fOijZwEBE:aK6H9eoeNtI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_-fOijZwEBE:aK6H9eoeNtI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_-fOijZwEBE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f51810a1676f3f3031e41dc36d202fc720ee6976767950832e61bdcaf238054","category":"Apple"}
