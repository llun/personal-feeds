Job growth has stalled, with 9.6 million fewer jobs in January than the same month a year earlier. But gig companies say they’re having trouble finding people to drive, pick up, and deliver for them.</p>\n<p>“I’m worried about one thing going into the second half of the year: Are we going to have enough drivers to meet the demand that we’re going to have?” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/uber/\">Uber</a> CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told an analyst last month.
