This display is designed to deliver crisp front-of-screen performance with its incredibly small custom mini-LED design, industry leading mini-LED density, large number of individually controlled local dimming zones, and custom optical films that shape the light while maintaining image fidelity and extreme brightness and contrast.</blockquote>In spite of this, some ‌iPad Pro‌ owners are noticing more blooming than expected and highlighting their experience on social media.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>After spending 24 hours with it I can safely say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiniLED?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MiniLED</a> is NOT the display tech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Apple</a> is likely gonna keep for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> long term. OLED is far superior with picture quality.

Local dimming allows some areas of an LED screen to dim almost off for darker, truer blacks, while preserving the bright parts of the screen. The technology can increase the contrast ratio of images significantly and enable the intense highlights of HDR content.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn a display with local dimming, if a zone is lit up and an adjacent zone is not, there may be an artifact toward the part of the screen that becomes brighter than its neighboring zone called \"blooming.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Holy blooming artifacts batman! ‌iPad Pro‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> 2500 dimming zones still can't touch Samsung AMOLED.<a href=\"https://t.co/hxswaFeWuB\">https://t.co/hxswaFeWuB</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BAINFlqbAQ\">pic.twitter.com/BAINFlqbAQ</a></p>— George Ou (@GeorgeOu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeOu/status/1395217045885657092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 20, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOLED displays, such as those used on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup, do not need local dimming since they are able to turn off individual pixels to achieve true blacks, all with no blooming effect. Local dimming can be a way to get near-OLED levels of picture quality, but it struggles to achieve the same level of contrast.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBlooming on the new 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ is therefore to be expected to some extent, but users seem to be divided about how bad the effect actually is.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>What can happen when you have 2,500 dimming zones. This is noticeable when you use ‌iPad Pro‌ 2021 in total darkness. <br /><br />‌iPad Pro‌ 2018 has less distracting blooming because the bloom covers a large area.
