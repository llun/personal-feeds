Existing Google Pay users are about to go through a transition reminiscent of the recent move from Google Music to YouTube Music: Google is killing one perfectly fine service and replacing it with a worse, less functional service. The fun, confusing wrinkle here is that the new and old services are both called \"Google Pay.\"</p>\n<p>Allow us to explain.</p>\n<p>The old Google Pay service that has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/google-rebrands-all-its-payment-solutions-as-google-pay/\">around for years</a> is dying. The app will be shut down in the US on April 5, and if you want to continue using New Google Pay, you'll have to go find and download a totally new app. NFC tap-and-pay functionality won't really change once you set up the new app, but the New Google Pay app won't use your Google account for P2P payments anymore. You'll be required to make a new account. You won't be able to send any money to your new contacts until they download the new app and make a new account, too. On top of all that, the Google Pay website will be stripped of all payment functionality in the US on April 5, and New Google Pay won't support doing anything from the web. You won't be able to transfer money, view payment activity, or see your balance from a browser.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747061#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747061&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"111c71a0bfdb6edcf55bfd95d90d427517771b976e8a5d982868c24f15e0d165","category":"Tech"}
