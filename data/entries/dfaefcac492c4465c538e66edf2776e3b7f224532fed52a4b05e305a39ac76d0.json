You&#8217;ve probably even seen the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/ronan-mclaughlin-world-record-everesting-attempt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">terrific film</a> that our video guru Phil Golston made about the ride (if you haven&#8217;t, you absolutely should). If you want to learn more about Mc Laughlin&#8217;s astonishing effort, you&#8217;ll also want to watch the interview he did with former pro turned YouTube star Phil Gaimon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaimon played a key role in popularising the Everesting speed record, setting a then-record time of 7:52:12 in May 2020. While Gaimon&#8217;s record was the first Everesting record in more than three years, his new mark lasted just four days as others starting coming for his crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video above, Gaimon and Mc Laughlin chat through all the details of Mc Laughlin&#8217;s new record. The pair have a great rapport and the video is both informative and entertaining throughout. Well worth a watch.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/video-phil-gaimon-and-ronan-mc-laughlin-chat-about-the-new-everesting-record/\">Video: Phil Gaimon and Ronan Mc Laughlin chat about the new Everesting record</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"dfaefcac492c4465c538e66edf2776e3b7f224532fed52a4b05e305a39ac76d0","category":"Cycling"}
