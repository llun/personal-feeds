{"title":"OldOS: iOS 4 Rebuilt in SwiftUI","link":"https://twitter.com/zzanehip/status/1402625414762270723?s=20","date":1623361524000,"content":"\n<p>Holy hell this new project from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zzanehip\">Zane</a>, a mononymous developer who just dropped this out of the blue yesterday. It’s available via TestFlight (the first one is full already, though) and <a href=\"https://github.com/zzanehip/The-OldOS-Project\">as open source code</a> you can build yourself.</p>\n\n<p>It’s exquisitely well done, very fun to play with, and surprisingly usable. And what a remarkable testimony to the expressiveness of Swift UI.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get past the surface aesthetic differences, it’s also interesting as a way to remember how many little things iOS has added over the years. iOS is <em>so</em> much richer now. You couldn’t do anything in list views back then, for example. E.g., if you wanted to delete a note in Notes, you had to open the note and tap the Trash button. In a view hierarchy, you couldn’t go back by swiping from the left edge of the display; you had to tap the navigation bar’s Back button.</p>\n\n<p>I remember feeling the same way going back to, say, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_6\">System 6</a> (1988) after taking for granted all the new features and conveniences added between then and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_8\">Mac OS 8.6</a> (1999). A decade is a long time.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/10/oldos\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b9cf04b20c29faf14a56cb0a6445cfacbd648268286e35942908e4f3f41bd5c4","category":"Tech"}
