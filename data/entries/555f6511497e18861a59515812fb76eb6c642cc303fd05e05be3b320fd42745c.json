An ad this week, for example, points out the gaming capabilities of Intel chips. Intel mentions Rocket League, a game that is not available on Apple's platform.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Only a PC can power scientists and gamers alike. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPC</a></p>&mdash; Intel (@intel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1359556486150635520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nAn ad from last week highlighted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/11/intel-mocks-apple-in-new-campaign-highlighting-things-users-cant-do-on-a-m1-mac/\">9to5Mac</a></em> points out the lack of a touchscreen on Apple's Macs. \"Only a PC offers tablet mode, touch screen and stylus capabilities in a single device,\" reads Intel's tweet.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Only a PC offers tablet mode, touch screen and stylus capabilities in a single device. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoPC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GoPC</a></p>&mdash; Intel (@intel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intel/status/1356633480776531968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nIntel's tweets link to a video from YouTuber Jon Rettinger demoing laptops equipped with Intel chips and comparing them to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8o3_tp3ums\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips received a lot of attention at launch due to their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-macbook-pro-vs-intel-macbook-pro/\">impressive speed and power efficiency</a>, which is not matched by Intel chips. Earlier this week, Intel launched a series of \"carefully crafted\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/06/intel-11th-gen-vs-apple-m1-chip-benchmarks/\">benchmarks</a> designed to prove that Intel's 11th-generation processors are better than the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips, but the benchmarks were designed to favor Intel machines and were described by Apple columnist Jason Snell as \"M1-unfriendly.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIntel's anti-Apple advertising is likely just getting started, as Apple plans to be largely free of Intel chips within a two year period. Apple is transitioning its entire Mac lineup to Apple silicon chips, with the MacBook Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> set to be refreshed next.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/intel-anti-mac-ad-campaign/\">Intel&#039;s Anti-Mac Ad Campaign Highlights M1 Shortcomings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intels-anti-mac-ad-campaign-highlights-m1-shortcomings.2284338/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YnHtMz4WpJE:rbp7j1bV7co:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YnHtMz4WpJE:rbp7j1bV7co:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YnHtMz4WpJE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"555f6511497e18861a59515812fb76eb6c642cc303fd05e05be3b320fd42745c","category":"Apple"}
