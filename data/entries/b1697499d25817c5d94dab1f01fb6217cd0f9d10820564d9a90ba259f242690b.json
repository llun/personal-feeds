But give Spotify credit&mdash;the company is doing more than just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18268861/spotify-apple-antitrust-fight-latest-updates-news&amp;xcust=1-1-342833-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">filing legal complaints</a>&nbsp;against Apple for unfair business practices, it&rsquo;s striving to make its service more appealing than Apple Music. In February, Spotify added&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-22/five-things-to-know-about-spotify-hifi/&amp;xcust=1-1-342833-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spotify HiFi</a>&nbsp;so you can listen to music with &ldquo;CD-quality&rdquo; sound, something&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334271/what-apple-music-can-do-to-catch-up-with-spotify.html\">Apple music doesn&rsquo;t have</a>. There have also been updates to the apps and web interface to make the service easier to use. And now, the Spotify iOS app supports &ldquo;Voice Interactions&rdquo; that provide hands-free control of the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Voice Interactions feature is rolling out to users gradually. To see if you have it, check the settings (the gear icon) within the Spotify app, and look for <em>Voice Interactions</em>. Tap it, and in the next screen, you&rsquo;ll see a switch to turn on &ldquo;Hey Spotify.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll also be prompted to give the app permission to use your iPhone&rsquo;s microphone. You have two voice options: Option 1 is a male voice; Option 2 is a female voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spotify-voice-interactions-setting-ios.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"Spotify Voice Interactions settings\" class=\"wp-image-100061092\"></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG/Spotify</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that&rsquo;s all set, you can then use Hey Spotify commands to run the app. For example, I said, &ldquo;Hey Spotify, play baby shark,&rdquo; and the app did a search and showed the results. Then it automatically played a song&mdash;one that I did not want. While a song played, the app was able to recognize me saying &ldquo;Hey Spotify play Lady Gaga&rdquo;&nbsp;to pull up search results and play a Lady Gaga song. I was also able to do other functions, such as play one of my playlists, skip a song, stop playing, and play a previous song. And I ran into a screen that said I couldn&rsquo;t do anything while an ad was playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to need some practice using this feature, though. I&rsquo;m too used to saying &ldquo;Hey Siri,&rdquo; and I said that almost every time I was in the Spotify app. Plus, there&rsquo;s the odd situation of saying &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; to launch the Spotify app on your iPhone, and then you need to make the mental gear switch to &ldquo;Hey Spotify&rdquo; while in the app. Hopefully I can get the hang of it soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also play songs, artists, albums, playlists, and more on Spotify using Siri voice commands. Simply say, &ldquo;Hey Siri, play [item] on Spotify.&rdquo; Siri also controls system-level playback functions like pausing, next and previous track, volume, and so on.</p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"How to use 'Hey Spotify' voice commands in the Spotify iOS app","siteHash":"9d463131e4ccb533ec33414e6d0536dcd0147b3a74d3e9ff492c0ea646127c1c","entryHash":"b1697499d25817c5d94dab1f01fb6217cd0f9d10820564d9a90ba259f242690b","category":"Apple"}
