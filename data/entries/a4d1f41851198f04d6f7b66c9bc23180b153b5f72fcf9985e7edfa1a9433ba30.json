It involves the rider shifting down and sitting on the bike's top tube while tucking in the elbows and shoulders to make themselves more aerodynamically efficient. </p>\n<p>Froome famously used the technique in winning Stage 8 of the 2016 <a href=\"/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> but to understand it better, watch the below video of Mohoric at the 2018 GP Industria Artigianato. </p>\n<div class=\"wysiwyg-widget-wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Matej Mohoric on his way to victory today in the GP Industria Artigianato ...
