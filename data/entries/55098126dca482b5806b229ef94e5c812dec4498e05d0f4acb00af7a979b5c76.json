The ad would simply display some of the information collected\nabout the viewer which the advertising platform uses. Facebook was\nnot into that idea.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook is more than willing to sell visibility into people’s\nlives, unless it’s to tell people about how their data is being\nused. Being transparent about how ads use people’s data is\napparently enough to get banned; in Facebook’s world, the only\nacceptable usage is to hide what you’re doing from your audience.</p>\n\n<p>So, here are some examples of the targeted ads that you’ll never\nsee on Instagram. Yours would have been <em>so</em> you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good point <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markhurst/status/1389679364795678720\">from Mark Hurst</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Facebook breaks the law and says “our enforcement is never\nperfect.” Sure, because it’s impossible to control their vast\nplatforms.</p>\n\n<p>But @Signal posted FB ads showing surveillance in action, and\nFacebook disabled them immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/04/signal-instagram-ads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"55098126dca482b5806b229ef94e5c812dec4498e05d0f4acb00af7a979b5c76","category":"Tech"}
