For glaciers like those in Greenland and Antarctica, most of this meltwater ends up in the ocean—with already noticeable consequences for rising sea levels.</p>\n<p>Better predictions of future sea level rise will require us to understand what meltwater is doing inside—and especially underneath—glaciers. But to do this, researchers need to take measurements <i>through</i> a glacier. Earlier this month, electrical engineer and glaciologist <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/1439317-prior-jones-michael\">Dr. Michael Prior-Jones</a> and his collaborators in the UK, Switzerland, Denmark, and Canada <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/cryoegg-development-and-field-trials-of-a-wireless-subglacial-probe-for-deep-fastmoving-ice/2CFB022762CD2B8E3906770AB256C6C0\">published</a> their redesigned version of a wireless subglacial probe—<a href=\"https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/2020/07/17/exploring-the-hidden-plumbing-of-glaciers-with-cryoegg/\">the Cryoegg</a>—to help study the inner “plumbing” of glaciers.</p>\n<h2>Glacial obstacles</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j9Ex3DGj67I\">meltwater flowing</a> through and underneath glaciers can end up in small pockets, large lakes, or fast-moving rivers—each of which destabilizes the overlying glacier to different degrees. Subglacial lakes can cause entire sections of the glacier to shift. By contrast, subglacial rivers channel meltwater into a smaller area, causing comparatively less glacial movement.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752135#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752135&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c616a28b9c55b03ecc6e83dcd090e22613a8c8c11475c33dd23f247b49170e74","category":"Tech"}
