At $699, it is $50 more expensive to get a repair for the new fifth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> than it was to get a repair for the prior fourth-generation model. The extra cost is likely due to the new mini-LED display that's exclusive to the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe repair $699 fee only applies if you don't have ‌AppleCare‌+. If you damage your ‌iPad Pro‌ and have an ‌AppleCare‌+ plan, the ‌AppleCare‌+ service fee is $49, with two accidental damage repairs available every 12 months.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou also won't need to pay a fee if there is a manufacturing issue, as problems that Apple's fault will be covered under the standard one-year warranty. If the warranty has expired, Apple will charge the $699 fee.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe $699 price applies to any damage to the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, including a broken display, and with a device as expensive as the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, ‌AppleCare‌+ is a good idea. Apple charges $149 for two years of ‌AppleCare‌+, or an ongoing subscription can be purchased for $7.99. ‌AppleCare‌+ used to be available for a limited amount of time, but can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/11/applecare-renewable-monthly-payment-plans/\">now be extended indefinitely</a> with the subscription options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOut-of-warranty fees for the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ have not changed, and it costs $499 to repair a broken 11-inch model if you don't have ‌AppleCare‌+, or $49 with ‌AppleCare‌+.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's new ‌M1‌ ‌iPad Pro‌ models went on sale this morning and the first new devices will be available to customers starting on May 21. The 12.9-inch model was in short supply and is now <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-july-shipping/\">sold out until July</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-out-of-warranty-fee/\">It Will Cost $699 to Repair a Broken 12.9-Inch M1 iPad Pro Without AppleCare+</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/it-will-cost-699-to-repair-a-broken-12-9-inch-m1-ipad-pro-without-applecare.2294235/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=r0FYIE8BEAM:ZmAKdDk_Jdc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=r0FYIE8BEAM:ZmAKdDk_Jdc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/r0FYIE8BEAM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bf1cc5509db18eb4af75931403db306b6b601e21e57b9e94e242a17db4dffbc8","category":"Apple"}
