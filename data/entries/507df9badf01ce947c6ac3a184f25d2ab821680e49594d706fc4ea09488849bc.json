{"title":"Apple Adds FaceTime Framework to Apple TV/HomePod Amid Speaker With Screen Rumors","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/","date":1616440543000,"content":"<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today revealed that Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\">been developing</a> new speakers that are equipped with \"screens and cameras,\" suggesting we could see a future HomePod-like device that has a built-in display and camera feature for FaceTiming and other functions.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/homepod-facetime-feature-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1623\" height=\"912\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-790255\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAhead of these rumors, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser\"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a> was combing through <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/apple-seeds-third-tvos-14-5-beta-to-developers/\">the tvOS 14.5</a> beta code and found that Apple has added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> and iMessage frameworks, along with a new AVFCapture framework related to capturing images.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYou might be wondering what tvOS code has to do with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/13/homepod-tvos-operating-system/\">in April 2020</a> Apple began using tvOS as the basis for the software that runs on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; rather than iOS. watchOS, tvOS, and the software that runs on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; are all variants of iOS, but each one is differentiated by the device the software is intended to run on with unique interfaces, APIs, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThat means features included in tvOS are also included in the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software since they have the same base code. Therefore, the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, iMessage, and image capture frameworks added to tvOS in tvOS 14.5 could actually be designed for a future &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; that has a screen and a camera, as described by Gurman.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> are able to use &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; audio already, but the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; framework discovered in the 14.5 beta is distinct from any code related to the existing audio &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; feature. The frameworks are in the tvOS 14.5 beta and the 14.5 &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software beta available to select testers. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGurman says there is no \"imminent launch\" planned for the camera-equipped speaker, so it's possible no such product will make an appearance. It's also entirely possible that the iMessage, &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, and AVFCapture frameworks introduced in tvOS 14.5 have an entirely different purpose that may be entirely unrelated to a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and could remain hidden in the code or used for an unspecified feature coming to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> or the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; in the future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn semi-related news, the 14.5 beta also suggests that Apple could potentially be developing some kind of trivia game for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, where &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could provide trivia questions for users to answer. This is labeled as \"&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Edutainment\" in the code, but it is not clear if it will be a built-in &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature or support for a third-party product.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/\">Apple Adds FaceTime Framework to Apple TV/HomePod Amid Speaker With Screen Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-facetime-framework-to-apple-tv-homepod-amid-speaker-with-screen-rumors.2289239/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ulVMSlZiG6A:fKJsV230rjA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ulVMSlZiG6A:fKJsV230rjA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ulVMSlZiG6A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover and Steve Moser","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"507df9badf01ce947c6ac3a184f25d2ab821680e49594d706fc4ea09488849bc","category":"Apple"}
