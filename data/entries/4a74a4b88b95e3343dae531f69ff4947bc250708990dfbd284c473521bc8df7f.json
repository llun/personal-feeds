A 179km pan flat course from Stupinigi to Novara, a three-man breakaway with no threat to the Maglia Rosa, a lack of technical roads added up to a guaranteed sprint finish.</p>\n<p>To be honest, it was the commentary teams tasked with providing extensive coverage of the entire stage that I felt sorry for. It was almost as if Patrick Lefevere gifted them the news Sam Bennett was leaving <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a> at the end of the season earlier that day so they had something actually interesting to talk about.</p>\n<p>Not until the final 10km did the race show any sign of a pulse and even then, the most exciting moment was when a rider from the peloton chucked his bottle in a designated litter zone only for it to directly hit a telephone pole and then explode over a poor lady below. It really was that unremarkable.</p>\n<p>\nThe stage was eventually won in a sprint, comfortably, by Grand Tour debutant Tim Merlier of Alpecin-Fenix, a team also making their introduction to three-week racing. Proof if ever you needed it that they are much more than just <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a>.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/specialized/9053/specialized-hotwalk-carbon-balance-bike\">Specialized Hotwalk Carbon balance bike: behind the scenes look at £999 kids' bike</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/5323/best-childrens-bikes\">Best children’s bikes: top picks of kids' bikes for every age</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8997/best-children-s-helmets-top-picks-of-kids-cycling-helmets-for-every-age\">Best children’s helmets: top picks of kids' cycling helmets for every age</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nMerlier beat Qhubeka-Assos's Giamcomo Nizzolo (who made it a record 11 second-place finishes at the Giro without victory) and Cofidis's Elia Viviani into third. Also, a thought for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE Team Emirates</a> sprinter Fernando Gaviria who was denied an opportunity at victory yesterday after being pushed into the barriers by his own teammate.</p>\n<p>Thankfully both stayed upright and no one was hurt, but I wouldn't have wanted to sit between them at dinner that evening.</p>\n<p>Despite it being an uneventfui stage, thankfully Italy is still a beautiful country and Chris Auld is still an excellent photographer. So here are the best images from Stage 2:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9594/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 22</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giro2021-stage2-1.jpg?itok=3bDa4YU1\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>22</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9594/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery\">Giro d'Italia 2021 Stage 2 Gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>10 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9594%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%202%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9594%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%202%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9594%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%202%20Gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9594%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9594/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-2-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 22</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giro2021-stage2-13.jpg?itok=_2MBomJf\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4a74a4b88b95e3343dae531f69ff4947bc250708990dfbd284c473521bc8df7f","category":"Cycling"}
