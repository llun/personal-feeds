{"title":"App Store Small Business Program's Lower Fees Cost Apple Less Than 5% of Revenue","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/app-store-fee-reduction-apple-cost/","date":1615940404000,"content":"Apple in November launched the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/apple-drops-app-store-fees/\">App Store Small Business Program</a>, which drops <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> fees from 30 percent to 15 percent for all developers who earn less than &#36;1 million from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and it turns out the price drop isn't costing Apple much money.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/app-store-15-percent-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-770551\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to estimates from app analytics company Sensor Tower shared by <em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/google-apple-giving-up-less-than-5percent-of-revenue-from-apps-with-pay-changes-estimate.html\">CNBC</a></em>, had Apple's program been in place for all of 2020, Apple would have missed out on &#36;595 million, or approximately 2.7 percent of the estimated &#36;21.7 billion in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees in 2020. The apps that earn the most money in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; are still subject to the full 30 percent fee and make up most of the money that Apple collects. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGoogle today also announced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/google-to-lower-play-store-commission/\">similar price drop</a> for developers, and starting on July 1, Google will collect 15 percent in Play Store fees from developers earning under &#36;1 million. Google too stands to lose little money. Sensor Tower estimates that if Google's lowered fees had been available across 2020, Google would have missed out on &#36;587 million, or about five percent of the &#36;11.6 billion in Google Play fees for the year.<blockquote>If the 15% fee schedule on revenue up to &#36;1 million had been in place on Google Play in 2020, Google would have missed out on &#36;587 million, or about 5% of Sensor Tower's estimate of &#36;11.6 billion in Google Play fees for the year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf Apple's program had been in place for 2020, Sensor Tower estimates that it would have missed out on &#36;595 million, or about 2.7% of its estimated &#36;21.7 billion in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees in 2020.</blockquote>Neither Apple nor Google share specific data on &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; sales, so Sensor Tower's data is based on estimates and is a rough calculation rather than an exact number. Apple lumps revenue collected from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; alongside other services, and Apple collected &#36;54.76 billion in fiscal 2020.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll developers who earn less than &#36;1 million from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in a calendar year are eligible for reduced fees, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/03/apple-developers-app-store-small-business/\">applies to</a> approximately 98 percent of developers. Developers who exceed &#36;1 million in sales will face the standard 30 percent fees. The fee reduction applies to app purchases, in-app purchases, and subscriptions.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSensor Tower in January estimated that 2020 &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; spending <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/app-store-spending-72-billion-2020/\">hit &#36;72 billion</a>, with users spending the most on games and entertainment.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/app-store-fee-reduction-apple-cost/\">App Store Small Business Program&#039;s Lower Fees Cost Apple Less Than 5% of Revenue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/app-store-small-business-programs-lower-fees-cost-apple-less-than-5-of-revenue.2288573/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dRegioKo2G4:7K7tPM1-kxE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dRegioKo2G4:7K7tPM1-kxE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dRegioKo2G4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3fae90cb895e3e73e40cadfb8d4767b6f44e8b9a5fee69b9e09d6a58fb69d9fc","category":"Apple"}
