After years of growth, the vast majority of PC gamers are locked into the Steam platform thanks to \"immense network effects\" and the high switching costs to move to a new PC platform, the suit argues.</p>\n\n<p>That makes the platform \"a must-have for game publishers,\" who need access to the players on Steam to succeed. But games that use the Steam platform also have to be sold on the Steam Store, where Valve takes its 30 percent cut of all sales. By leveraging its monopoly platform power into a \"gatekeeper role\" for the store, Valve \"wield[s] extreme power over publishers of PC Desktop Games\" that leads to a \"small but significant and non-transitory increase in price\" for developers compared to a truly competitive market, the suit argues.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761574#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761574&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c28f02ffd233e469b879ac85eabb267a88e9a19936dace78974d2f2c85e4df8e","category":"Tech"}
