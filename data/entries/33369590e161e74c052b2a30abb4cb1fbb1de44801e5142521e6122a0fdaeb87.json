Those days are over. The world's most valuable car company now has $17 billion in cash in the bank and is currently building its third and fourth car factories—near Berlin and Austin, Texas, respectively.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Tesla <a href=\"https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22\">released its financial results</a> for the first quarter of 2021, and they were the company's best numbers yet. The electric carmaker reported net earnings of $438 million on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States)\">GAAP</a> basis. Revenues were $10.4 billion. That number is down slightly from the fourth quarter's record figure of $10.7 billion, but it's up more than 70 percent from a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Despite the record profit and near-record revenues, Wall Street wasn't impressed. Tesla's stock lost more than 3 percent of its value in morning trading.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760378#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760378&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
