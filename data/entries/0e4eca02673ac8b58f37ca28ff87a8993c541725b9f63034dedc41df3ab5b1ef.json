But I think Spiegel is right that Snap might not exist without the iPhone — or, if it did, that it would exist in a very different form. The iPhone and App Store have been very good for Snap. It’s a concept that is truly native to the smartphone.</p>\n\n<p>But here’s the thing thing: Snap isn’t in the business of charging its users money. <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061915/how-snapchat-makes-money.asp\">From Investopedia</a>, citing <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001564408/799dba00-c613-4d87-b858-916aff0d832a.pdf\">Snap’s 10-K for 2020</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Substantially all of Snap’s revenue is generated from advertising,\nwhich accounted for 99% of the company’s total $2.5 billion in\nrevenue in 2020, up from 98% in 2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>99 percent of Snap’s revenue is from advertising, not a nickel of which Apple gets a commission from. I’m not faulting Snap in the least for building an ad-based business — Daring Fireball gets at least 95 percent of its revenue from advertising. But the CEO of a company whose business doesn’t rely on in-app purchases or subscriptions doesn’t really seem like a good person to ask about Apple’s commission structure.</p>\n\n<p>Find me the CEOs of companies that generate a significant percentage of their revenue through App Store transactions who espouse the same sentiment as Spiegel. I’m not saying they don’t exist — I’m sure some do — but let’s hear from those with skin in the game.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/24/spiegel-app-store\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0e4eca02673ac8b58f37ca28ff87a8993c541725b9f63034dedc41df3ab5b1ef","category":"Tech"}
