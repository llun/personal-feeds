Then How Novel’s Mystery Books subscription service is perfect for you. Each month, you’ll get to choose two novels from a curated list of at least five Mystery Books across a range of genres – they’re all paperbacks that have been recently published. The only catch is, you have to base your decision solely on the four hand-drawn illustrations on the front of each wrapped book. The illustrations aim to give you some insight as to what the book is about, and you have to pick the two that most pique your interest. A monthly subscription for two books usually costs £14.99, but with this exclusive <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3edsnqO\" target=\"_blank\">deal</a>, you can get your first month for just £9.99, with postage included.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3edsnqO\" target=\"_blank\">Save £5 now</a></p>\n<section><div>\n        <p><em><strong>Note: </strong></em><i>We negotiate hard to bring you great offers and the best prices in our online deals.

The books sold out at trial events, and since being rolled out on a bigger scale, Mystery Boks has gone from strength to strength and has featured on TV on <em>This Morning</em>, as well as in <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Independent</em>, <em>Breathe</em> and<em> GQ</em>.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/img-1-4c83513.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/IMG_0158-img-2-73cb178.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/img-3-f0ba912.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/IMG_0151-img-4-144fde9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3edsnqO\" target=\"_blank\">Save £5 now</a></p>\n<p><em>You can find all our current shopping deals<strong> <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/bikeradar-daily-deals/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>.
