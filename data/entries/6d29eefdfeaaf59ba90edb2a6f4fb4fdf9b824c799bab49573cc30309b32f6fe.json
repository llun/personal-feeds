Make your own judgements on lumping Pinot with Van der Poel, but Roglič needs to get on the phone to his agent.</p>\n<p>Rounding out the list are the highest paid 'sprinter' Elia Viviani and Nairo Quintana on €1.9 million followed at 20 by Fernando Gaviria on €1.8 million.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9409/paris-roubaix-wont-take-place-in-april\">Paris-Roubaix will not take place in April</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/1105/in-praise-of-cobbles\">In praise of cobbles</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9321/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no31-marie-odile-amaury\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No31: Marie-Odile Amaury</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/2252/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2021: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nWhile a few riders have had a big payday after smashing the 2020 season (or switching teams), one rider has fallen off the list considerably.</p>\n<p>Last year Fabio Aru sat in fifth with €2.6 million, but after a few disappointing seasons with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\">UAE Team Emirates</a>, his move to Qhubeka-Assos hasn't been quite as lucrative. </p>\n<p><b>Top 20 highest paid riders, according to <em>L'Équipe</em></b></p>\n<p>1.
