It’s not just any tandem though, so let’s check it out in detail below.<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/08/Bens-Gilmour-Tandem-39.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/04/Legor-Cycli-MTB-Touring-Tandem-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/09/Grinduro-93race.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>We’ve featured a lot of tandem content here at the Radavist. Probably more than any other cycling website in fact. I think I lost count of how many articles have featured tandems over the years, so I’ll spare you of all the adages aligned with these “relationship accelerators” but I will say if you’re interested in seeing more <em>tandemonium</em>, check out our Related articles below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Wilson-and-Grant-on-the-Sincere-Cycles-Humble-Frameworks-Tandem-36.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to tandems, I think this one is my favorite. It’s owned by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sincerecycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sincere Cycles</a>‘ Bailey Newbrey and it usually hangs up in the window of the shop but a few months back, it came down for it had a new role to play in the forthcoming weeks. You might remember seeing this wild bike in action during <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2019/06/building-community-at-sincere-cycles-in-santa-fe/\" target=\"_blank\">our Shop Visit to Sincere Cycles from a few years back</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/06/SincereCycles-59.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Yeah, it’s seen some action over the years. Bailey bought it from Humble Frameworks back when he lived in Chicago as a gravel-race machine. The story goes, Humble made two tandems, and one was bought by Beyoncé’s assistant. Whether Bee hopped on it with Jay-Z is unknown but it’s a pretty fun factoid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Wilson-and-Grant-on-the-Sincere-Cycles-Humble-Frameworks-Tandem-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Some of the key differences you’ll note in its current build are the addition of two custom <a href=\"https://www.buckhornbags.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckhorn Bags framebags</a>, a new Sinewave Beacon light, and an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/made.by.evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\">Evergreen Stitchworks</a> cockpit bag.
