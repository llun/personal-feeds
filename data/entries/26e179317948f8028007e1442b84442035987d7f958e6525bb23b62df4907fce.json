I know it sucks to get up for work or school in the dark, but it sucks to have the sun set at 4:30 in the afternoon, too. It also seems to me that we’ve named our times wrong — what we call “standard time” is only used 133 days per year. If we do drop the shift, it’ll be to standardize on daylight savings time.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘The Growing Push to Make Daylight Time Year-Round’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/16/year-round-daylight-time\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"26e179317948f8028007e1442b84442035987d7f958e6525bb23b62df4907fce","category":"Tech"}
