We’ll still be covering all of the news from the Giro d’Italia and the wider world of cycling as we move forward, but we’ll be changing up our approach over the coming weeks, which will mean focusing more clearly on the individual stories instead of aggregating them into a single digest. Stay tuned to CyclingTips.com this month and beyond for your coverage of all things cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dane Cash<br />News Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bennett wins stage 3 of the Volta ao Algarve</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sam Bennett</strong> nabbed his second win in three days on Friday’s stage 3 at the <strong>Volta ao Algarve</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 203.1 km stage from Faro to Tavira came down to a bunch kick, where Deceuninck-QuickStep, as the team has so many times already this year, put on another show of its lead-out strength. Bennett’s teammates helped pull him to the front of the pack inside the last kilometer with <strong>Michael Morkow</strong> leading the way in the last few hundred meters. Then, when Bennett jumped, nobody could catch him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danny van Poppel</strong> took runner-up honors on the day while Morkov held on to nab third. Overnight leader <strong>Ethan Hayter</strong> finished safely in the peloton to retain his GC lead.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Volta ao Algarve em Bicicleta (2.Pro)\n                                                    <span>Faro → Tavira</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255425\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">BENNETT Sam</a>\n                                            <span>Deceuninck -

suggesting he should call it a career. Froome continues to work towards getting to his best nearly two years after suffering multiple injuries in a serious crash at the <strong>Critérium du Dauphiné</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Obviously, over the last couple of races I’ve seen quite a lot of people on social media getting in touch and saying, ‘Listen, mate, hang up your bike. You’re done. You’re finished. You’re never going to get back there.’ And it just makes me laugh,” <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/froome-on-doubters-it-just-makes-me-laugh/\" target=\"_blank\">Froome said</a> in a video entitled “Chris Hits Back!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“First of all, I don’t think those people know just how bad my injuries were and how far I’ve had to come just to get back to a professional level of racing. But those people clearly don’t know me either as a person. I’m not just going to hang it up. I know I can get there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sagan on Groenewegen: ‘It is good he is back in the peloton’</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peter Sagan</strong> discussed the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> and more in a media appearance ahead of the race on Friday. As <a href=\"https://www.velonews.com/events/giro-ditalia/peter-sagan-on-dylan-groenewegen-he-made-a-mistake-its-good-he-is-back/\" target=\"_blank\">VeloNews</a> reports, the three-time world champ said that he is currently focused on the sprints at the Giro and that it is not yet decided whether he would race this year’s Tour de France. He also touched on the subject of <strong>Dylan Groenewegen</strong>, against whom he will be sprinting at the Giro. The Giro marks Groenewegen’s return to racing after he was suspended for nine months for his role in causing a crash at last year’s Tour of Poland that left Fabio Jakobsen seriously injured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Of course, what happened at the Tour of Poland was an accident,” Sagan said, according to VeloNews. “In life and in sport, everyone can make a mistake. I do not judge him. I’ve done many sprints against him in the peloton, and I think that it is good he is back in the peloton.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Van der Poel, Ferrand-Prevot take Albstadt World Cup short track wins</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mathieu van der Poel</strong> and <strong>Pauline Ferrand-Prevot</strong> took the wins in Friday’s short track events at the <strong>Albstadt</strong> round of the <strong>MTB World Cup</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Poel finished two seconds ahead of runner-up <strong>Victor Koretzky</strong> in the men’s race, with <strong>Nino Schurter</strong> rounding out the podium in third. Ferrand-Prevot bested <strong>Linda Indergand</strong> by one second in the women’s race, with <strong>Annie Last</strong> taking third on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming up …</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2021 Giro d’Italia gets underway on Saturday with an opening time trial of 8.6 km. It will be flat and it should be fast. World TT champ Filippo Ganna looks like a strong contender for the stage, with Remco Evenepoel, Rémi Cavagna, and Victor Campenaerts among the others in attendance who could nab the win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get the latest from the <strong>world of women’s cycling</strong> in the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/womens-cycling-weekly-issue-24/\" target=\"_blank\">Women’s Cycling Weekly</a>.</li><li>The latest <strong>Strava</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/new-strava-update-makes-big-changes-to-layout-organization-and-navigation/\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> makes some big layout changes.</li><li>As Iain Treloar writes, the story of this year’s <strong>European Track Championships</strong> is <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/the-story-of-the-european-track-championships-keeps-getting-weirder/\" target=\"_blank\">getting weird</a>.</li><li><strong>Filippo Ganna</strong> will be sporting a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/filippo-gannas-pinarello-bolide-gets-a-new-custom-paint-job/\" target=\"_blank\">custom paint job</a> as he takes on the opening TT at the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> on Saturday.</li></ul>\n\n\n    <div>\n    <div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2>GET THE DAILY NEWS DIGEST DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter your email address to have the Daily News Digest delivered directly to your inbox and receive instant access to comment on any article on CyclingTips.com</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <a>Sign Up</a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n\n\n\n    </div>\n    </div>\n\t\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/bennett-wins-again-at-the-volta-ao-algarve-daily-news/\">Bennett wins again at the Volta ao Algarve: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4f02b066b01752f9857e6177bac3f0439ea2fc4d734b4f345f7822ce6f27ce1e","category":"Cycling"}
