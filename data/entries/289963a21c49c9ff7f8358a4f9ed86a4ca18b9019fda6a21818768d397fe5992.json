The shortage could be a hint of an imminent change to the iMac lineup just a few days before Apple hosts a product launch event on April 20.</p>\n<p>In particular, the cheapest, 1080p iMac (the rest of the 21.5-inch models have 4K displays) is seeing ship dates slipping back several days into late April or early May, which is usually a sign of low supply. This Mac in particular is also increasingly unavailable for pickup at physical Apple Stores around the US.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the more expensive 27-inch iMac is shipping within a normal window, and it is showing as available at more retail stores.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757570#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1757570&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"289963a21c49c9ff7f8358a4f9ed86a4ca18b9019fda6a21818768d397fe5992","category":"Tech"}
