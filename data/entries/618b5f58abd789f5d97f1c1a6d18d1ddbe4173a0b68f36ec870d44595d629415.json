{"title":"2022 Women’s WorldTour Calendar includes Tour de France Femmes and Giro d’Italia Donne","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/2022-womens-worldtour-calendar-includes-tour-de-france-femmes-and-giro-ditalia-donne/","date":1622744635000,"content":"<p>On Thursday the UCI announced the Women’s WorldTour calendar for 2022. The biggest new addition on the calendar is the eight days stage race Tour de France Femmes that will take place from the 24th to the 31st of July, directly after the men’s Tour de France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been snippets of news regarding a women’s Tour de France for the last two years and Christian Prudhomme finally <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/a-womens-tour-de-france-is-looking-more-likely/\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed the event </a>in May of 2021. In an interview with The Guardian Prudhomme stated that there would be a women’s Tour de France that would take place once the men had finished racing, but did not confirm the number of stages or exact dates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the release of the 2022 WWT calendar the number of stages and dates are confirmed, although the nature of the courses will not be revealed until the men’s route is announced much later in 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second biggest news is the re-installation of the Giro d’Italia Donne, or Giro Rosa, from July first to the tenth. The Giro Rosa had been WorldTour from 2016 to 2020 but was demoted to 2.Pro for 2021 after they failed to comply with UCI WWT regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longest stage race on the women’s calendar, the Giro d’Italia Donne has a complicated relationship with riders and fans. Despite the UCI rule that all WWT races must have at least 45 minutes of live coverage, 2021 will be the first year the event provides live viewing. Still, it is a prestigious race, and to win the pink jersey is a much sought after feat and would cement your name in the history books of women’s cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other additions to the calendar include three days of the RideLondon Classique in May and the long-anticipated Battle of the North. The inaugural six-day stage race in Denmark, Norway and Sweden was set to start in 2021 but was postponed due to the pandemic. It was also originally slated to last 10 days but the organizers were unable to find a spot on the calendar for a 10-day event in August. The new race will replace the Ladies Tour of Norway, a four-day race that began in 2014. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> As for the one-day events to take place in 2022, there is not much change. Although the ASO originally said they would still host La Course by the Tour de France as a single-day event during the men’s Tour, it does not appear on the current 2022 calendar. The women will kick off their WWT season with Strade Bianche in early March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like Paris-Roubaix will return to its originally Spring timeslot on April 10th, but with <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/paris-roubaix-has-been-postponed/\" target=\"_blank\">the luck they’ve had so far</a> who knows what will happen. The Postnord Vargarda road race and time trial return to the calendar and will not be part of the Battle of the North as was originally planned in 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall the calendar is front packed with one-day events with stage racing starting up mid-May and dominating July and August. The women will in theory have a lot more WWT race days in 2022, if all goes according to plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.WWT Stage races</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>May 05-07: Tour of Chongming Island, China<br />May 13-15: Itzulia Women, Spain<br />May 19-22: Vuelta a Burgos, Spain<br />May 27-29: RideLondon Classique, Great Britain<br />June 6-11: Women’s Tour, Great Britain<br />July 1-10: Giro d’Italia Donne, Italy<br />July 24-31: Tour de France Femmes, France<br />August 9-14: Battle of the North, Norway<br />August 30-September 4: Boels Ladies Tour, Netherlands<br />September 8-11: Ceratizit Challenge by La Vuelta, Spain</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.WWT One day events</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>March 5: Strade Bianche, Italy<br />March 13: Ronde van Drenthe, Netherlands<br />March 20: Trofeo Alfredo Binda, Italy<br />March 24: Oxyclean Classic Brugge-De Panne, Belgium<br />March 27: Gent-Wevelgem in Flanders Fields, Belgium<br />April 3: Ronde van Vlaanderen, Tour des Flandres, Belgium<br />April 10: Paris-Roubaix, France<br />April 17: Amstel Gold Race, Netherlands<br />April 20: La Flèche Wallonne, Belgium<br />April 24: Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Belgium<br />August 6: Postnord Vargarda TTT, Sweden<br />August 7: Postnord Vargarda RR, Sweden<br />August 27: GP Lorient Agglomération-Trophée Ceratizit, France<br />October 18: Tour of Gaungxi, China</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/2022-womens-worldtour-calendar-includes-tour-de-france-femmes-and-giro-ditalia-donne/\">2022 Women’s WorldTour Calendar includes Tour de France Femmes and Giro d’Italia Donne</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"618b5f58abd789f5d97f1c1a6d18d1ddbe4173a0b68f36ec870d44595d629415","category":"Cycling"}
