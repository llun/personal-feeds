{"title":"China Boycotts Western Clothes Brands Over Xinjiang Cotton","link":"https://www.economist.com/business/2021/03/27/china-boycotts-western-clothes-brands-over-xinjiang-cotton","date":1617062208000,"content":"\n<p>The Economist:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For more than a year some big foreign apparel and technology\ncompanies have been walking a fine line on the human-rights abuses\ncommitted by China against <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/13/genocide-is-the-wrong-word-for-the-horrors-of-xinjiang\">Uyghurs</a>, a mostly Muslim ethnic\nminority in the north-western region of Xinjiang. These firms\nhave been working to clear their supply chains of the forced\nlabour of Uyghurs, hundreds of thousands of whom pick cotton under\napparently coercive conditions. What they have not done is boast\nabout these efforts, fearful of angering the Communist Party and\n1.4bn Chinese consumers. “Usually in our work it’s easier to get\ncompanies to say they’re doing the right thing than to actually do\nit,” says Scott Nova of the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), a\nlabour-monitoring organisation, and the Coalition to End Forced\nLabour in the Uyghur Region. “On this issue, with limited\nexceptions, the opposite is true.”</p>\n\n<p>An online furore stoked by Chinese authorities this week suggests\nthat Beijing may be tiring of this double game. China’s\ngovernment, increasingly keen to punish critics of their Xinjiang\npolicies, is forcing foreign companies to make a choice they have\nbeen studiously trying to avoid: support China or get out of the\nChinese market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You play with fire, you eventually get burned. It seems inevitable that more and more companies doing business in China are going to run into conflict between western cultural values and CCP demands that run contrary to them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/29/china-xinjiang-cotton\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"11a93af386fa3001dc350a4cb2c05836e2efc08fcee0c8e4e4563c727d63742d","category":"Tech"}
