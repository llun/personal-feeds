The move will help Apple cut production costs since more chips can be produced on one wafer, reducing total wafer output.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe redesigned VCSEL chip may allow Apple to integrate new functions into the component, but <em>DigiTimes</em> did not speculate on what these could include. The change may also free up internal space.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe smaller Face ID chip will apparently be used in new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> devices released from late 2021 onwards. The first devices to feature the new chip will presumably be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> and ‌iPhone 13‌ Pro, as well as the next generation of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DigiTimes</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/iphone-13-smaller-notch-pro-cameras-larger-cis/\">previously said</a> the notch on the ‌iPhone 13‌ models will \"shrink\" in size, becoming smaller thanks to a redesigned camera module that integrates the Rx, Tx, and flood illuminator to allow for the size reduction. Barclays analysts have similarly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">explained</a> that a smaller notch on ‌iPhone 13‌ models will be the result of a \"more tightly integrated version of the current structured light system\" for Face ID. It is not clear if the smaller, more consolidated Face ID technologies in the ‌iPhone 13‌ are related to this smaller VCSEL chip.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/14/apple-making-face-id-sensor-chip-smaller/\">Apple Making Face ID Sensor Chip Smaller on Upcoming iPhones and iPads</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-making-face-id-sensor-chip-smaller-on-upcoming-iphones-and-ipads.2296103/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=g2tzhMLodkE:vBmlms4fn_g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=g2tzhMLodkE:vBmlms4fn_g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/g2tzhMLodkE\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9d055c3100290dc9e51cb2bfae778533cafb8b7d6b6f3efa9d4324e6202b8f28","category":"Apple"}
