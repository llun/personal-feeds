{"title":"New Beats Studio Buds Images Spotted in Regulatory Database","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/beats-studio-buds-regulatory-database/","date":1623261931000,"content":"Additional signs of the Beats Studio Buds are continuing to pop up ahead of their release, with new images and details found in a Taiwan's NCC (National Communications Commission) database.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/beats-studio-buds-size-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe've already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/\">seen multiple pictures</a> of the Beats Studio Buds, which feature a wire-free in-ear stemless design that sets them apart from prior Beats headphones and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>. The database photos give us some insight into size.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/beats-studio-buds-size.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beats Studio Buds fit into the ear and feature silicone tips, and there's likely to be multiple size options available to ensure a snug fit. There's a small body that houses electronics, with a Beats logo visible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor charging purposes, the Beats Studio Buds come with an oval-shaped charging case made from matching plastic material. The photos have all featured black Beats Studio Buds and a black case, but there will be white and red versions available too, presumably with matching cases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/beats-studio-buds-case.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Beats Studio Buds use a USB-C cable for charging, according to the database, which means there's a USB-C port on the case rather than a Lightning port. So far, ‌AirPods‌ and past Beats headphones like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/\">Powerbeats Pro</a> have charged over Lightning, so this could signal a further shift to USB-C.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/usb-c-beats-studio-buds.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe design of the Beats Studio Buds has sparked interest because it is similar to the rumored design of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2, which are expected later this year. The next-generation ‌AirPods Pro‌ are rumored to have a compact, rounded design that's also stemless, which sounds a lot like the new Beats.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Beats-Studio-Buds-feature-3.75.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no word yet on when the Beats Studio Buds might launch, but they've already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/lebron-james-beats-studio-buds/\">been spotted out in the wild</a> in the ears of various athletes like LeBron James, so Apple may be planning to release them soon.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats-studio-buds/\">Beats Studio Buds</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/beats-studio-buds-regulatory-database/\">New Beats Studio Buds Images Spotted in Regulatory Database</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-beats-studio-buds-images-spotted-in-regulatory-database.2300107/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ez-atYiRQ2U:mR6Xey5ctLw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ez-atYiRQ2U:mR6Xey5ctLw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ez-atYiRQ2U\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"19b029b7b3465e18c8c4987488705420b9505af9405d2f5e03c8eee21ca636e4","category":"Apple"}
