When the pilot program launches, workers will move between their store and remote roles depending on demand in stores vs. online shopping at different times during the year. Salaries will remain constant regardless of where an employee is working.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nParticipants in the Retail Flex program are being asked to participate for at least six months, with the initiative to ramp up from September to December when new devices are set to launch. Employees will be reimbursed for some internet expenses and will receive $100 to put toward office equipment.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor corporate employees, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-employees-returning-to-work/\">implementing a work schedule</a> that will see them returning to the office for three days a week starting in September. Some employees <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/05/apple-staff-complain-about-plans-for-office-work/\">petitioned Apple</a> for a more remote friendly work environment that would allow them to work from home permanently, but Apple's retail and people lead Deirdre O'Brien clarified that Apple's in-person work schedule <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/apple-still-plans-return-to-in-person-work/\">is non-negotiable</a> as in-person work is \"essential\" to Apple product development and company culture.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-basics-help-and-buying-advice.78\">Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-store-employees-work-from-home/\">Apple Developing Hybrid 'Retail Flex' Work From Home Program for Apple Store Employees</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developing-hybrid-retail-flex-work-from-home-program-for-apple-store-employees.2302952/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pD2zgnF2AzU:rRs5bPVyv5I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pD2zgnF2AzU:rRs5bPVyv5I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pD2zgnF2AzU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9bb3ca05fb734f791a4e21a69716533c4d0fcd2f06242eab11f8823d17ebbad1","category":"Apple"}
