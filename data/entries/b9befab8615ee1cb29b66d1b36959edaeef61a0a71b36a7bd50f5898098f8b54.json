As the vehicle ascended, it cleared the low cloud deck into blue skies. Starship then hovered before beginning its return to Earth.</p>\n<p>The camera attached to the Starship vehicle's exterior provided imagery during the descent, which appeared to be fairly smooth as the vehicle \"flopped\" over and oriented itself to come back through the thickening atmosphere. During three previous high-altitude flights, Starship prototypes have performed this graceful maneuver without much apparent difficulty.<!--adbreak--></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753078#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753078&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9befab8615ee1cb29b66d1b36959edaeef61a0a71b36a7bd50f5898098f8b54","category":"Tech"}
