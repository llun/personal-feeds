This would raise AT&amp;T's fiber deployment to about 18 million homes and businesses.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T provided a list of the <a href=\"https://about.att.com/ecms/dam/snrdocs/fiber/ATTFiberBuild_8.5x11_03042021.jpg\">90 metro areas here</a>. The vast majority of them already have AT&amp;T fiber access, as seen in this <a href=\"https://www.att.com/shop/internet/gigapower/coverage-map.html\">AT&amp;T fiber map</a>.</p>\n<p>This likely means the 3 million new locations will primarily consist of homes and businesses close to AT&amp;T's existing fiber installations instead of homes and businesses in entirely unserved areas. We asked AT&amp;T for more details on the planned fiber deployment and will update this article if we get more information.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749297#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749297&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e8400ede9e019484eb28cd97186cd1d64361cd6dd186fe333e5fe96aa8a7544","category":"Tech"}
