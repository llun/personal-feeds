The initial ship date for all of the above was May 21, but ship estimates have slipped slightly due to demand for some products—and significantly for others.</p>\n<p>Specifically, most configurations of the 24-inch iMac, 11-inch iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K are currently showing ship dates between May 21 and 27, while some specific configurations of the iMac and 11-inch iPad Pro are shipping in early June. The worst case, though, is the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which in some configurations is shipping as late as July.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761531#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761531&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"971ac3bdb7d249e86c5a3e10c4ca283f337bdb89f0829d1a1cfe3f1aba2542bc","category":"Tech"}
