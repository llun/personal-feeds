It's very close to my heart. I had pneumonia around the year 2000 and came really close to stepping out. When I came home from the hospital my wife had cleaned out my study, and I thought to myself, I've died, I'm a ghost. And the idea for \"Lisey's Story\" came from that.</blockquote>Viewers also hear from director Pablo Larraín, producer J.J. Abrams, and the show's cast as they discuss their experience working with King to turn the story into an ‌Apple TV+‌ original.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe series follows Lisey Landon (played by Julianne Moore) two years after the death of her husband, famous novelist Scott Landon (played by Clive Owen). A series of unsettling events causes Lisey to face memories of her marriage to Scott that she has deliberately blocked out of her mind, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe series premieres on ‌Apple TV+‌ on Friday, June 4.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/27/apple-stephen-king-liseys-story-apple-tv-june-4/\">Apple Offers Deeper Look into Stephen King's 'Lisey's Story' Coming to Apple TV+ June 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-deeper-look-into-stephen-kings-liseys-story-coming-to-apple-tv-june-4.2298067/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5B07usGZyyk:vPzwsEXFMoo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5B07usGZyyk:vPzwsEXFMoo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5B07usGZyyk\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e99588c1cf49cdc4ba3f7c66d96b665f66bc0c6ef6999f0532e5e4c018cf8b68","category":"Apple"}
