Chipolo has opened up preorders for its One Spot tracker and it’s cheaper than the AirTag—by a buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chipolo One Spot tracker is available for $28 each or $90 for a pack of four and works exclusively with the Find My app. It’s $3 more expensive than the universal <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-one-spot&amp;xcust=1-1-346260-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Chipolo One</a> ($15 more for a pack of four). Chipolo’s site says the first batch of preorders have sold out and new orders will now ship in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, the One Spot tracker has a keyhole ring for attaching to a set of keys without a separate adapter and offers lesser IPX5 water resistance, meaning it can sustain a blast of water but doesn’t guarantee against submersion. Like the AirTag, the One Spot uses a CR2032 replaceable battery and has a 120dB speaker so you can audibly locate it. However, the Chipolo One Spot does not include an ultra-wideband chip for precision tracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-one-spot&amp;xcust=1-1-346260-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">preorder the One Spot on Chipolo’s website</a>.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a19a8fd7581a85dbd20bafb5584e5b74ab71f1a4559d26ac858f11df79373053","category":"Apple"}
