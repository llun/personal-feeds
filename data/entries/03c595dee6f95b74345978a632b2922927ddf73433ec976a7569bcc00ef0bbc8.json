That's $12 off the device's typical going rate online and only $4 higher than the lowest price we've tracked.</p>\n<p>While we recently sang the praises of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/200-puro-pro-hybrid-over-the-ear-headphones-are-almost-perfect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$200 Puro Pro headphones</a>, the Soundcore Life Q30 is a great choice for those who can't spend that much. We haven't formally reviewed the headphones on the site, but we plan to make them a budget pick in an upcoming guide to wireless noise-canceling headphones. For well under $100, they offer a comfortable design that's well-padded and light on the head (if heavy on plastic), tremendous battery life that can supply more than 40 hours per charge (depending on volume), USB-C charging, physical volume and playback controls, and convenient multidevice pairing.</p>\n<p>In terms of sound quality, the Soundcore Life Q30 has a \"V-shaped\" signature, which means they accentuate the bass and treble ranges at the expense of some midrange detail. The bass is particularly emphasized, so many hip-hop and pop tracks will have some serious punch. The headphones are definitely not a device for audio purists who like their cans to be as true to a song's recording quality as possible, but if you prefer a more excited sound (and many do), the Soundcore Life Q30 provide that without sounding sloppy. What's more, Anker's companion app has a graphic EQ with several presets that let you customize the sound into something brighter or more flat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745078#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745078&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03c595dee6f95b74345978a632b2922927ddf73433ec976a7569bcc00ef0bbc8","category":"Tech"}
