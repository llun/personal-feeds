This capability has been the number one feature request as our customer’s organizations have adopted infrastructure as code. It is the result of a year of partnering with some of our largest customers to accomplish two goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zero downtime from application node loss</li>\n<li>The ability to horizontally scale beyond one node</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#introducing-the-active-active-architecture\" aria-label=\"introducing the active active architecture permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"introducing-the-active-active-architecture\" aria-hidden></a>Introducing the Active/Active Architecture</h2>\n<p>The new deployment pattern is an evolution of our previous <a href=\"https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/before-installing/reference-architecture/index.html\">reference architectures</a>, which means the work you have already done is still valid and can be easily extended:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare your existing network for cross-node communication and Redis</li>\n<li>Provision cloud-managed Redis next to your existing Terraform Enterprise instance</li>\n<li>Connect your existing instance to the newly provisioned Redis service</li>\n<li>Scale to two nodes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All-in-all we have seen customers make the migration in a matter of days across all three public clouds.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#scale-up-today\" aria-label=\"scale up today permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"scale-up-today\" aria-hidden></a>Scale Up Today</h2>\n<p>Do you have an immediate need to scale to two nodes? Please reach out to your Technical Account Manager to plan out a smooth journey to Active/Active.</p>\n<p>For more information on Terraform Enterprise, visit the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform\">Terraform product page</a>.
