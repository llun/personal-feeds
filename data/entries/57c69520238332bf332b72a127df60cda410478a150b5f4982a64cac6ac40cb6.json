To achieve those goals, the Bay State will add gigawatts of offshore wind power, spur cities and towns to adopt a net-zero building code, and set targets for electric vehicles, charging stations, and energy storage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>The state expects that it will be able to fully eliminate 85 percent of all carbon emissions by 2050. For the remaining 15 percent, it will have to find other options, including tree planting or direct air capture of carbon dioxide. The net-zero target of 2050 is encouraged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to avoid warming of greater than 1.5˚ C.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752886#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752886&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57c69520238332bf332b72a127df60cda410478a150b5f4982a64cac6ac40cb6","category":"Tech"}
