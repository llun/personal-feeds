He has been\nfully vaccinated for almost two months, he said, and only recently\ndecided to meet a vaccinated friend for a drink, unmasked. “It was\nhard — psychologically hard — for me,” Jha said.</p>\n\n<p>“There are going to be some challenges to re-acclimating and\nre-entering,” he added. “But we’ve got to do it.”</p>\n\n<p>And how did it feel in the end, I asked, to get together with\nhis friend?</p>\n\n<p>“It was awesome,” Jha said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Get vaccinated and get back to normal life. It’s that simple.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/irrational-covid-fears\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e608fd4814e26e9c85ca9d3f36ca8de0f208dd1b4f6a02f5985723f855e9594b","category":"Tech"}
