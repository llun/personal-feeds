{"title":"Apple Gave Zoom Access to Special API to Use iPad Camera During Split View Multitasking","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/09/zoom-ipad-camera-api-access/","date":1620550831000,"content":"Zoom, a hallmark platform used by millions during the global health crisis, has been given access to a special iPadOS API that allows the app to use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> camera while the app is in use in Split View multitasking mode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/zoom-app-icon.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThis case of special treatment was first brought to attention by app developer Jeremy Provost, who, in a <a href=\"https://blog.thinktapwork.com/post/649630720084639744/ipad-camera-multitasking\">blog post</a>, explains that Zoom uses a special API that allows the app to continue using and accessing the ‌iPad‌ camera while the app is being used in Split View mode.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nZoom can do this thanks to an \"entitlement,\" which grants developers the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements\">ability to execute a particular capability with an API</a>. As Provost notes, Apple publicly documents the ability for developers to apply for several different entitlements, such as ones related to <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/carplay/requesting_the_carplay_entitlements\">CarPlay</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_homekit\">HomeKit</a>, and more. However, the special API that Zoom has been given is not offered to other developers by Apple, nor is its existence acknowledged by the company itself.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn the Zoom Developer Forum, a staff member for the video conferencing platform had <a href=\"https://devforum.zoom.us/t/video-camera-not-working-in-split-view/43387/2\">confirmed earlier in February</a> that Zoom has access to the \"com.apple.developer.avfoundation.multitasking-camera-access,\" or ‌iPad‌ Camera Multitasking entitlement. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/zoom-dev-forum-ipad-api.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFor obvious reasons, this ability is useful when users may want to reference and use a separate app during a video conferencing call. Without this special API, if a user puts a video conferencing app into Split view mode, the video call would go dark as the app cannot access the ‌iPad‌ camera when multitasking. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new revelation comes at a troubling time for the Cupertino tech giant. The company is currently embroiled in a mammoth legal battle with game developer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, which accuses it of holding unfair, and anti-competitive control over the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and the distribution of apps on iOS devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-vs-apple-trial-begins/\">trial between the two titans began on May 3</a>, and ever since, evidence, including email correspondence between Apple executives and employees, has revealed that Apple has previously granted certain developers, such as Hulu, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/\">access to APIs</a> unavailable to other developers. Apple contuines to pledge that it treats all developers the same and offers everyone a \"level playing field.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've reached out to Apple for comment and will update this post if we hear back.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/zoom/\">Zoom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/09/zoom-ipad-camera-api-access/\">Apple Gave Zoom Access to Special API to Use iPad Camera During Split View Multitasking</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-gave-zoom-access-to-special-api-to-use-ipad-camera-during-split-view-multitasking.2295426/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=U28L4qMMOjs:urqISOVQpT4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=U28L4qMMOjs:urqISOVQpT4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/U28L4qMMOjs\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"84e9f7a3fc2f9f762a8bbe862d58491ebe0f41778d518f99ace17d0a27d02c4d","category":"Apple"}
