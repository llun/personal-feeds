Maps shows the location of fixed cameras that check for speed and stopping at red lights.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCurrently Apple only <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-speed-cameras\">lists</a> speed camera availability in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but today's report suggests the feature is coming to the Netherlands and potentially other regions, too. So far, alerts for speed cameras have been seen in North Holland's Haarlem region, so it could be a while before the country gets full rollout. <em>iCulture</em> notes that &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; still doesn't show the maximum speed on Dutch roads.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is working on a new Maps feature for iOS 14.5 or later that lets users <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/ios-14-5-apple-maps-crowdsourcing-accidents/\">report speed checks along a route</a>, suggesting a future version of Maps could use crowdsourcing to alert drivers to mobile speed traps.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Several readers in Austria and Australia have since contacted <em>MacRumors</em> to say they have also noticed the speed camera feature appearing for them in &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-netherlands/\">The Netherlands</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-maps-speed-camera-info-netherlands/\">Apple Maps Starts Showing Speed Camera Information in Additional Countries [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-starts-showing-speed-camera-information-in-additional-countries-updated.2289938/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wJ-ekrl-ycg:_F47OoNKBpQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wJ-ekrl-ycg:_F47OoNKBpQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wJ-ekrl-ycg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a9cc19db0b139df11fa29d235cd9749b38ec3debdf951e91da18307d2eb5600a","category":"Apple"}
