The figure's generously sized erect phallus has earned it the nickname \"Rude Man\" and no doubt contributes to its popularity as a tourist attraction. Archaeologists have long speculated over exactly when, and why, the geoglyph was first created. Now, thanks to a new analysis of sediment samples, researchers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/12/cerne-giant-in-dorset-dates-from-anglo-saxon-times-analysis-suggests\">narrowed down the likely date</a> for the Rude Man's creation to the late Saxon period—a surprising result, since no other similar chalk figures in the region are known to date from that time period.</p>\n<p>\"This is not what was expected,\" <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/press-release/national-trust-archaeologists-surprised-by-likely-age-of-enigmatic-cerne-giant--but-some-mystery-still-remains\">said geoarchaeologist Mike Allen</a>, who has been working with the National Trust on the ongoing project to learn more about the Cerne Abbas Giant. \"Many archaeologists and historians thought he was prehistoric or post-medieval, but not medieval. Everyone was wrong, and that makes these results even more exciting.\" National Trust senior archaeologist Martin Papworth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/12/cerne-giant-in-dorset-dates-from-anglo-saxon-times-analysis-suggests\">told the Guardian</a> he was \"flabbergasted\" by the results, saying, \"I was expecting 17th century.” </p>\n<p>In the 1990s, archaeologists relied on soil samples to date another well-known geoglyph—the 360-foot-long <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffington_White_Horse\">Uffington White Horse</a> in Oxfordshire—to between 1380 and 550 BCE. And the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Man_of_Wilmington\">Long Man of Wilmington</a> in East Sussex dates back to the 16th century.  \"Archaeologists have wanted to pigeonhole chalk hill figures into the same period,\" <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/press-release/national-trust-archaeologists-surprised-by-likely-age-of-enigmatic-cerne-giant--but-some-mystery-still-remains\">said Allen</a>. \"But carving these figures was not a particular phase—they’re all individual figures, with local significance, each telling us something about that place and time.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779346#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779346&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e73dcde022821cb49bf5ed0dd8c62605507f1689f4ca2c7643185fea5fc1fac","category":"Tech"}
