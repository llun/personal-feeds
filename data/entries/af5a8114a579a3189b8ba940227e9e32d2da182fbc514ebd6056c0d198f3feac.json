His teammate Lucas Hamilton also hit the deck in the incident, with the list of other crashers also including Rafal Majka (UAE Team Emirates), Nacer Bouhanni (Arkéa-Samsic), and Sergio Higuita (EF Education-Nippo), among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few minutes later, BikeExchange announced that both Yates and Hamtilon had pulled out of the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They were both able to continue riding but have since abandoned,” the team said on Twitter, noting that further updates on their condition would follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to coming as a blow to the BikeExchange squad at the Tour, the news could also impact Australia’s Olympic ambitions. Yates has been focused on the Tokyo road race as a major target for quite some time, and Hamilton was also recently named to the team.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Riders fell way down the hill on that crash. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TDF2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TDF2021</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/mFjMU7dckz\">pic.twitter.com/mFjMU7dckz</a></p>\n<p>— CyclingTips (@cyclingtips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclingtips/status/1413499765334048776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> </p><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/simon-yates-abandons-the-tour-de-france-after-a-crash/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"af5a8114a579a3189b8ba940227e9e32d2da182fbc514ebd6056c0d198f3feac","category":"Cycling"}
