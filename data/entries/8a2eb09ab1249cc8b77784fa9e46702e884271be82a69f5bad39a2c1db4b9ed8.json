At the time, Nintendo said that the site had been \"among the most visited and notorious online hubs for pirated Nintendo video games\" for \"over a decade.\"</p>\n<p>Storman has admitted that, in 2019, the site made up the bulk of his $30,000 to $36,000 a year in income. This included direct revenue from the sale of \"premium unlimited accounts\" for $30 per year that provided users with faster downloads and no limits. By the time Storman signed a September 2020 agreement with Nintendo to shut the site down, he said he was deriving $800 a month from the site. According to court documents, Storman's income is now derived primarily from \"unemployment and food stamps.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768886#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768886&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a2eb09ab1249cc8b77784fa9e46702e884271be82a69f5bad39a2c1db4b9ed8","category":"Tech"}
