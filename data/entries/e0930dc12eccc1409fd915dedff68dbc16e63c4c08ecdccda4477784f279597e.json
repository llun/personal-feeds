Voice control also allows you to play specific tracks, artists, albums, favorites or playlists.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Deezer, to start using the service on ‌HomePod‌ or ‌HomePod mini‌, users need to launch the Deezer app and connect their account to their speaker in settings. Alternately, to choose a default streaming service on ‌HomePod‌, follow these steps:<ol>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Launch the <strong>Home</strong> app on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap the <strong>Home</strong> icon, select <strong>Settings</strong>, then choose the home that you want to edit.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap your name under \"People.\"</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Tap <strong>Default Service</strong> under \"Media,\" then select the streaming service that you want to set to default.</li></ol>If you haven’t set Deezer as your default, make sure to say \"on Deezer\" at the end of your command such as, \"Hey ‌Siri‌, play Bad Bunny on Deezer.\" Subscribers can also like or dislike tracks, play on repeat or shuffle. Note that Deezer on ‌HomePod‌ doesn't support podcasts, audiobooks, or live radio.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>\"Our listeners don't have to compromise on audio quality thanks to ‌HomePod‌. HiFi users can still enjoy all of their favorite tunes in true lossless audio,\" said Nicolas Pinoteau, Director of Partnership Solutions at Deezer. \"But, don't worry, even if you don't have HiFi, Deezer on Apple ‌HomePod‌ is the perfect at-home companion when you need to multitask or want to give your eyes and fingers a break.\" </blockquote>Deezer on ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ is available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
