They believe the drug in question was ordered with the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/01/closing-argument-tribunal-is-told-that-freeman-ordered-testosterone-to-dope-a-rider/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">intent to administer it to an athlete</a> with the hope of improving their athletic performance.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Freeman, the former chief doctor for both Team Sky and British Cycling, faced 22 charges related to incidents in May 2011. These allegations included; purchasing a prohibited substance, lying to UK Anti-Doping, untrue statements and communications to conceal his conduct, inappropriately provided medical treatment to non–riding staff, failing to maintain an adequate record management system, and inappropriate management of prescription-only medications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean Ingle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/12/dr-richard-freeman-found-guilty-of-ordering-banned-testosterone-for-unnamed-rider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Guardian</a> tweeted quoting the full MPTS report, &#8220;Taking all those factors into account and bearing in mind the breadth of Dr Freeman’s dishonesty and the number of people he had pulled into it (Ms Meats, Dr Peters &amp; Mr Sutton), the Tribunal found his conduct incapable of innocent explanation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thread on MPTS verdict.

Dr Freeman denied the remaining four charges, including ordering the Testogel specifically for an athlete to improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defence had argued Shane Sutton, former British Cycling and Team Sky head coach, had bullied Dr Freeman into ordering the banned substance to treat Sutton&#8217;s erectile dysfunction. Shane Sutton vehemently denied this claim and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/11/sutton-walks-out-of-freeman-medical-tribunal-hearing/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stormed out of the tribunal</a>&nbsp;in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mpts-uk.org/hearings-and-decisions/medical-practitioners-tribunals/dr-richard-freeman-oct-19\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The tribunal</a> has been active since February 2019, with&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/12/freeman-tribunal-adjourned-until-next-year/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">many delays</a>&nbsp;and sometimes farcical claims, including&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/10/former-sky-doctor-freeman-says-he-destroyed-a-laptop-met-with-james-murdoch/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">loss or destruction of laptops</a>. It will reconvene on March 17th to decide on Dr Freeman&#8217;s fitness to practice. The tribunal is set to meet again in April to decide if Dr Freeman should retain his doctor&#8217;s license or receive any further punishments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Freeman may also face a UK Anti-Doping Agency enquiry relating to the charge of lying to UK Anti-Doping, tantamount to tampering with an investigation. If found guilty, Dr Freeman could face a four-year ban regardless of whether or not he intends to return to sport.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/richard-freeman-guilty-of-ordering-testosterone-for-an-unknown-rider/\">Richard Freeman guilty of ordering testosterone for an unknown rider</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0d350585bd03829d8b1d05b369051c4f5876c5604972293f58a09c389416abbe","category":"Cycling"}
