The state has seen a 400 percent spike in cases since March 5, when state officials eased restrictions on residential gatherings and occupancy limits for bars, restaurants, venues, and stores. Since then, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant has also increased in prevalence. Now, the state’s seven-day average for new daily cases is over 7,377, and hospitals are filling up.</p>\n<p>On March 30, when the surge was already in full swing, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/30/vaccine-supply-michigan-whitmer/\">Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appealed to the White House</a> for additional vaccine shipments. However, the White House declined, opting to stick to its largely population-based strategy for dolling out vaccine supply to each state and jurisdiction.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756350#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756350&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0468e7971caeaa1c4d13631b8f7f0b8db58fbd7f34d388320b16338049666bd1","category":"Tech"}
