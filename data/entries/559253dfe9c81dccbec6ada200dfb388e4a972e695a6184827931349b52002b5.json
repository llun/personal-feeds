The ‌iPhone‌ used for the test must be unlocked, it must be on iOS 14.5 or higher, and an eSIM cannot be in use for a customer's existing provider.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose who want to sign up can download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t-mobile-network-test-drive/id1521545162\">T-Mobile Network Test Drive app</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, following the installation and activation instructions from there.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2014/06/18/iphone-tmobile-test-drive/\">long offered a Test Drive service</a> to allow customers to try its data network before committing, but prior to the introduction of the eSIM (and for those without eSIM functionality), T-Mobile mailed out hotspot devices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/29/t-mobile-network-test-drive-esim/\">You Can Now Test T-Mobile's Network Using an App and eSIM</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-test-t-mobiles-network-using-an-app-and-esim.2302722/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2kXmHbAzPVI:oLFuwMQ-ckk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2kXmHbAzPVI:oLFuwMQ-ckk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2kXmHbAzPVI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"559253dfe9c81dccbec6ada200dfb388e4a972e695a6184827931349b52002b5","category":"Apple"}
