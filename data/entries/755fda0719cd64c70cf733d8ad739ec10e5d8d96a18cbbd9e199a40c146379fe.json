According to today's report, the infrastructure for ‌Apple Pay‌ has been ready in the country for some time, and the delay has been due to closures in the economy and the need to make sure that enough businesses can accept the payment method.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Pay‌ payments go through Apple's digital Wallet app for mobile iOS devices, therefore any financial entity that wants its customers to pay using the method must sign an agreement with Apple. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past year, several banks and credit card companies in Israel have signed such an agreement, and as part of the contract, they must pay Apple a commission derived from the amount of the transaction, estimated to be 0.05%. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's iPhones command a 20% share in Israel's smartphone market, so there's plenty of scope for ‌Apple Pay‌ to become a popular payment method in the country. First introduced in 2014, ‌Apple Pay‌ is now available in over 50 countries or regions around the world.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Thanks, Morad!)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/israel/\">Israel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/22/apple-pay-expected-to-launch-israel-next-month/\">Apple Pay Expected to Launch in Israel Early Next Month</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-expected-to-launch-in-israel-early-next-month.2292735/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1SOHtdmyCY4:FCi8G_ncWEk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1SOHtdmyCY4:FCi8G_ncWEk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1SOHtdmyCY4\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"755fda0719cd64c70cf733d8ad739ec10e5d8d96a18cbbd9e199a40c146379fe","category":"Apple"}
