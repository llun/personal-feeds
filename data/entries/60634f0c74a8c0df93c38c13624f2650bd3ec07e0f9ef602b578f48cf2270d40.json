When Windows 11 publicly releases, it's likely to be a fine operating system—but right now, it's an unpolished, unfinished mess.</p>\n<p>Of course, this isn't a surprise—Windows 11 is still only available in the Dev channel of the Insider program. The three Insider channels are Release Preview, Beta, and Dev; Dev roughly corresponds to a software alpha, and Microsoft itself describes it as \"the newest code,\" with \"rough edges and some instability.\"</p>\n<h2>Windows 11 is upgrade only (for now)</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windows-11-upgrade-980x735.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          You can't perform a nice, clean Windows 11 installation yet, sadly—you'll need to use Windows Update to mangle an existing Windows 10 installation instead.

To install Windows 11 Build 22000.51, you must begin with a fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 installation, then <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/get-started\">flight</a> it into the Dev channel, then <em>upgrade</em> it to Windows 11 via Windows Update. (If you're not already on Windows 10 20H2 or newer, you'll need to get through that upgrade first.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778841#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60634f0c74a8c0df93c38c13624f2650bd3ec07e0f9ef602b578f48cf2270d40","category":"Tech"}
