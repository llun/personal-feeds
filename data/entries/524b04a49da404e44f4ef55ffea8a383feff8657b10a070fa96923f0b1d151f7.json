Still, the DSM rider successfully delivered her teammate <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/giro-donne-lorena-wiebes-continues-sprinting-dominance/\" target=\"_blank\">Loren Wiebes to two stage victories </a>over the course of the Giro Donne. Rivera has taken victories at the Women’s Tour in Great Britain, RideLondon, Trofeo Alfredo Binda, and was the first American (man or woman) to win the Tour of Flanders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In just a few weeks Rivera will fly to Japan to compete at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, a dream that Rivera and her dad had for years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a dream of mine and for the family and my dad to go to the Olympics,” Rivera <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uw3PSy50kU\" target=\"_blank\">told NBCLA</a> in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Rivera emotional after that win. She lost her dad to COVID a few months ago. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GiroDonne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GiroDonne</a><a href=\"https://t.co/oyX2N7Pdfu\">pic.twitter.com/oyX2N7Pdfu</a></p>— CyclingTips (@cyclingtips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclingtips/status/1414227996181876742?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 11, 2021</a></blockquote> \n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/coryn-rivera-wins-final-giro-donne-stage-with-an-angel-on-her-shoulder/\">Read More</a>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"524b04a49da404e44f4ef55ffea8a383feff8657b10a070fa96923f0b1d151f7","category":"Cycling"}
