{"title":"Tufekci, Gertz, and Silver on the FDA’s Pause on the J&J Vaccine","link":"https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1381954152465596417","date":1618330900000,"content":"\n<p>Zeynep Tufekci, on Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>FDA says the pause is due to “abundance of caution.” I am very\nmuch for abundance of caution against tail risk, and a full\ninvestigation into rare events. I respect these are difficult\ndecisions. But “caution” isn’t the term for dramatic,\nforward-leaning and irreversible acts.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate the people saying “we should feel <em>more</em> confident\nbecause they’re investigating”, which is true — it works on me! — but the word “should” is doing a lot of work there. Meanwhile,\nlet’s check in on how this affects dynamics of human cognition,\nmedia and social media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1381933962445094916\">Matt Gertz</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am extremely skeptical of the ability of public messaging to\ndisaggregate “the J&amp;J vaccine is under review as a precaution”\nfrom “the J&amp;J vaccine is not safe and the others may not be\neither” in the minds of normal people. An incredibly crucial,\nhigh-stakes test for the press.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nate Silver, responding to Gertz:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s also a high-stakes test for the FDA, and they failed it,\nbecause of course lots of people are going to take away the latter\nmessage.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also data on this based on decreased public confidence in\nthe AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe following similar pauses there.\nSo the FDA can’t even use the excuse of flying blind.</p>\n\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trust-oxford-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-wanes-europe-survey/\">Link</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1381962085094031360\">Also Silver</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If out of the blue one morning Gov. Newsom was like “Shark attacks\nare extremely rare, but out of an abundance of caution, we’re\nclosing every beach in California until we investigate more”,\nthat’s not likely to get more people to go out to the beach, even\nonce beaches reopen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/tufekci-gertz-silver-fda-pause\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3f9feebe48079bde880c61f01c04fa4559464b246933f7b026e85b9b5d0477b6","category":"Tech"}
