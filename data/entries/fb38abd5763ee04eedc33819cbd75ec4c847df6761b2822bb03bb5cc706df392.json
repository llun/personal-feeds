Maybe this should've been obvious beforehand—since everyone from Michael Bay to Netflix rolled out shot-in-quarantine films in recent months—but the era of COVID-19 films is clearly upon us, before the era of COVID-19 has subsided even a tad.

(Apparently, roughly 20 pages of the script were all filmed on the same road.)</p>\n<p>\"This was during the time when we all were still really afraid to open our doors and breathe outside,\" Call said. “It wasn’t that far after March 2020 that we made the March 2020 movie—it was June when we started writing it.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751106#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1751106&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb38abd5763ee04eedc33819cbd75ec4c847df6761b2822bb03bb5cc706df392","category":"Tech"}
