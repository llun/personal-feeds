Molly experiences the trials and tribulations of adolescence, Cole is challenged by a truly embarrassing moment at school, Paige continues to chase down the mayor's corruption story, and Owen juggles managing the park, his staff and his family all with a smile on his face.

Every step of the way, we are guided along by our friendly, fumbling, fiddler narrator, Birdie.</blockquote>\"Central Park\" characters are voiced by Josh Gad, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Kathryn Hahn, Tituss Burgess, and Stanley Tucci.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe first season of \"Central Park\" was recognized with an Emmy Award nomination for Leslie Odom Jr., and it has been nominated for this year's NAACP Image Awards in the Outstanding Animated Series category.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/apple-tv-plus-central-park-season-3/\">Apple Renews Animated Musical Comedy &#039;Central Park&#039; for a Third Season</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-renews-animated-musical-comedy-central-park-for-a-third-season.2287875/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LFxGS5rYxns:POaACntvgJk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LFxGS5rYxns:POaACntvgJk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LFxGS5rYxns\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"164971a7f25ffc58d45221360a31d6abd605d7f769f2180c7b3301c821a32414","category":"Apple"}
