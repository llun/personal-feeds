Michael Woods (Israel Start-Up Nation) took third from a group of favourites that finished 39 seconds behind the two leaders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his stage win, Carapz also took the leaders jersey from stage 4 winner Mathieu van der Poel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Poel tried his hand at the breakaway earlier in the stage but was dropped when the road started to climb towards Leukerbad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fuglsang was one in a group of general classification favourites in the final 20 km of the stage. He attacked and spent 15 km out front, but was eventually joined by Carapaz with 3 km to go. The two rode to the line together with a group of heavy hitters chasing. Woods and Lucas Hamilton (Team BikeExchange) attacked on the final climb but in the end, rode into the finish with four other GC hunters. </p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Tour de Suisse (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>Gstaad → Leukerbad</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=256133\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">CARAPAZ Richard</a>\n                                            <span>INEOS Grenadiers</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <time>04:01:52</time>\n                                </div>\n                                                            <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>2</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">FUGLSANG Jakob</a>\n                                            <span>Astana -
