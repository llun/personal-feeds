{"title":"iOS 15 Photos App Now Displays EXIF Metadata for Images","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/photos-app-images-exif-info/","date":1623102529000,"content":"If you've ever wanted to see the EXIF data for a photo right on your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app, then you're going to want to install the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> update right away.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/photos-app-metadata.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith ‌iOS 15‌, each image in the ‌Photos‌ app has a new \"Info\" button available that displays image format, the details of the camera used to capture it, and the location where it was taken.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to now, there was no way to view this information directly in the ‌Photos‌ app on the ‌iPhone‌, so you had to use either a third-party app, a Shortcut, or a different device to view it. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis interface can be used to add captions and to see the location where a photo was taken, plus there is an option to adjust metadata such as date captured. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome photos will also have a sparkle next to the Info button, which means there's info that you can see in Look Up mode. On a photo of a flower, for example, the ‌Photos‌ app is able to compare it to other flower images on the web, providing a possible identification for the flower type. In the screenshot below, this is indeed an accurate assessment of the type of flower in the image.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also a new option to tap the \"Live\" button for any Live photo to automatically turn it a Loop, Bounce, or Long Exposure. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/photos-app-images-exif-info/\">iOS 15 Photos App Now Displays EXIF Metadata for Images</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-photos-app-now-displays-exif-metadata-for-images.2299639/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zYUcSECW-AE:amyYXaenWuQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zYUcSECW-AE:amyYXaenWuQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zYUcSECW-AE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"86ffa9af14b17a98f52b0c9f06fd869b877cc028015a5369c335c31b4d247c29","category":"Apple"}
