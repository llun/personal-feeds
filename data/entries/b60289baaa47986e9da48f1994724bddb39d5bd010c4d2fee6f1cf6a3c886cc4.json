No equipment fees. No contracts. No surprises or exploding bills.\" The service has no data cap, but T-Mobile's home Internet customers will get slower speeds than mobile customers in times of congestion.</p>\n<p>\"During congestion, Home Internet customers may notice speeds lower than other customers due to data prioritization,\" T-Mobile said in a footnote in the announcement. T-Mobile says this should be rare. In its Open Internet <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/internet-service\">disclosure</a>, T-Mobile said that home Internet \"customers receive the same network prioritization as Heavy Data Users, but should be less likely to experience congestion because the equipment is stationary and available in limited areas.\" (\"Heavy Data Users\" are mobile customers who face potential slowdowns because they exceed a specific limit, which is 50GB per month on most T-Mobile plans. The 50GB threshold is not used for 5G home Internet, but the home service may be slowed down relative to mobile speeds when the network is congested even if a home customer hasn't used much data that month.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755409#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755409&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b60289baaa47986e9da48f1994724bddb39d5bd010c4d2fee6f1cf6a3c886cc4","category":"Tech"}
