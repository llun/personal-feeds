On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> is the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> to include sensor-shift optical image stabilization for its Wide lens. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization shifts the sensor itself instead of the lens, resulting in a sharper image with better image quality. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to <em>DigiTimes</em>, Apple will include sensor-shift OIS for both the Wide and Ultra Wide lens on the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro Max. An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/sensor-shift-all-iphone-13-models-rumor/\">earlier report</a> suggested that Apple will also bring the Wide lens with sensor-shift OIS to the remaining models in the lineup. The new lenses will also include autofocus, according to the report.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn November of last year, Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/06/kuo-iphone-13-same-sizes-better-ultrawide-camera/\">claimed</a> that the Ultra Wide lens for the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro models willalso  benefit from a wider ƒ/1.8 aperture, compared to ƒ/2.4 on &zwnj;iPhone 12 Pro&zwnj; models. The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup is expected to consist of four models, all benefiting from a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/lidar-scanner-on-all-iphone-13-models-rumor/\">LiDAR Scanner</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">120Hz ProMotion display</a>, and more.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/iphone-13-pro-sensor-shift-ultra-wide/\">iPhone 13 Pro Models Expected to Feature Improved Ultra Wide Lens With Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization and Autofocus</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-pro-models-expected-to-feature-improved-ultra-wide-lens-with-sensor-shift-image-stabilization-and-autofocus.2286902/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bPQvg21xPoY:bPEbbcYaar4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bPQvg21xPoY:bPEbbcYaar4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bPQvg21xPoY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91c5dc97948380a66528f369c5f91aa28ea5b5f26ce79624737a1bbb547c9685","category":"Apple"}
