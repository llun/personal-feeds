We're hearing rumors about MacBook Pro, iMac, AirPods, and more, although many of these will be coming out at different times over the course of the year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Top-Stories-47-Feature-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-785929\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week also saw a macOS update to address a significant issue with some of the latest MacBook Pro models when connected to certain USB-C hubs and docks, while our videographer Dan Barbera took a second look at the MagSafe Leather Wallet released alongside the iPhone 12 models. Read on for all of the details!\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>New MacBook Pro Models With HDMI Port and SD Card Reader Expected to Launch Later This Year</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nLast month, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple plans to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in the second half of this year</a> with brighter Mini-LED displays, a new design with a flat-edged top and bottom, the return of additional ports and a MagSafe charging cable, and physical function keys instead of the Touch Bar.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/2021-mbp-hdmi-slot-3d-peach.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-785930\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThis week, Kuo got more specific about those additional ports, claiming that the two new MacBook Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">will be equipped with an HDMI port and an SD card reader</a> at a minimum.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf these rumors pan out, this may be one of the most significant overhauls to the MacBook Pro ever, with many fan-favorite features returning. There is also lots of anticipation surrounding next-generation Apple silicon chips given the already-impressive performance of the M1 chip in lower-end machines like the MacBook Air and base model 13-inch MacBook Pro.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMini-LED backlighting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/mini-led-ipad-pro-macbooks-ennostar/\">could extend to a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> that is rumored to be released as early as March.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>2021 iMac Said to Come in Five Colors, Apple Silicon Mac Pro to Resemble 'Stacked' Mac Minis</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's next-generation iMac <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/prosser-imac-colors-mac-pro-to-resemble-mac-minis/\">will be available in the same colors as the latest iPad Air</a>, including Silver, Space Gray, Green, Sky Blue, and Rose Gold, according to leaker Jon Prosser of Front Page Tech.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/flat-imac-3d-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785704\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has previously reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/\">new iMac will be redesigned with slimmer bezels</a> and no metal chin below the display, and a flat rear shell similar to Apple's high-end Pro Display XDR. This would represent the first redesign of the all-in-one desktop computer since 2012.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGurman also reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/02/apple-smaller-mac-pro-apple-silicon/\">developing a smaller version of the Mac Pro</a> with an Apple silicon chip, and Prosser this week claimed that this machine will look similar to three to four Mac minis in a stack. The design may be reminiscent of the Power Mac G4 Cube, released in 2000.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Third-Generation AirPods Possibly Shown in Leaked Image</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is rumored to be working on third-generation AirPods for release later this year, and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">alleged image of the earphones and their charging case surfaced this week</a> on Chinese website <em>52audio</em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/new-airpods-leaked-image-52audios.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784818\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new AirPods‌ are expected to take design cues from the ‌AirPods Pro‌ by having a smaller stem and silicone ear tips, but they will reportedly lack high-end features such as Active Noise Cancelation, allowing for a lower price tag. The current AirPods are priced at &#36;159 with a wired charging case and at &#36;199 with a wireless charging case, while the AirPods Pro retail for &#36;249.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nJapanese website <em>Mac Otakara</em> has previously claimed that second-generation AirPods Pro are also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/09/airpods-pro-2-iphone-se-3-april-2021-rumor/\">planned for release in April</a>. Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">aiming to make the second-generation AirPods Pro more compact</a> by eliminating the stem that sticks out from the bottom, resulting in a more compact design like Google's Pixel Buds, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Apple Releases macOS Big Sur 11.2.2 to Prevent MacBooks From Being Damaged by Third-Party Non-Compliant Docks</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nA new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-2-2/\">macOS Big Sur 11.2.2 software update has been released</a> for Mac users that prevents 2019 or later MacBook Pro and 2020 or later MacBook Air models from incurring damage when they are connected to certain third-party, non-compliant powered USB-C hubs and docks, according to Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/macOS-Big-Sur-Feature-Triad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785715\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere have been several reports on Reddit from Mac users who have connected USB-C hubs and docks to their machines, resulting in the machine becoming non-functional. Affected Macs appear to go blank and unresponsive shortly after connecting the dock. Many of the users who experienced issues were using hubs and docks not purchased from reputable companies.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new ‌‌‌‌‌macOS Big Sur‌‌‌‌ 11.2.2‌ update can be downloaded for free on all eligible Macs using the Software Update section of System Preferences.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Revisiting Apple's MagSafe Leather Wallet After 3 Months</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nOn our YouTube channel this week, <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/20/apple-magsafe-wallet-long-term-review/\">revisited Apple's MagSafe Wallet for iPhone 12 models</a> after using the accessory for three months, and his impressions were more favorable after this extended usage.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-leather-wallet-magsafe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-784716\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nDan initially disliked the MagSafe Wallet because he found it had a weak magnetic connection and could easily fall off the iPhone when placing the device in a pocket, but he has learned to adjust his usage habits in a way that has worked out better for him.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/feb-25-2021\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/27/top-stories-macbook-pro-imac-airpods-rumors/\">Top Stories: MacBook Pro, iMac, and AirPods Rumors, macOS 11.2.2, MagSafe Wallet Revisited</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-macbook-pro-imac-and-airpods-rumors-macos-11-2-2-magsafe-wallet-revisited.2286438/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SLYVzRkH4ZE:DVo4X4sTQV8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SLYVzRkH4ZE:DVo4X4sTQV8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SLYVzRkH4ZE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ec6ee4037a331dc4ded78b96249ff0c190c9be35abbb54b3fc165aa1f8c4749","category":"Apple"}
