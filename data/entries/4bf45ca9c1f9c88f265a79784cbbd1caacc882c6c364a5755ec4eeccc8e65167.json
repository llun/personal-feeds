Porte is a two-time winner of Paris-Nice, having taken victories in 2013 and 2015.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crash was caused by a wayward water bottle, according to Ineos teammate Ben Swift, who said the bottle went under George Bennett&#8217;s wheel, causing the Kiwi to swerve into Porte. The incident occurred with 33 km remaining in the first stage. Determined to carry on after the crash, Porte remounted and rode 20 km alone before getting in the Ineos team car. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">üó£Ô∏è It was a tough opening day out there at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ParisNice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ParisNice</a> üò¶<a href=\"https://twitter.com/swiftybswift?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@swiftybswift</a> gives us the lowdown, including his view of Richie&#8217;s crash <a href=\"https://t.co/2psT6ErN4s\">pic.twitter.com/2psT6ErN4s</a></p>‚Äî INEOS Grenadiers (@INEOSGrenadiers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/INEOSGrenadiers/status/1368600493971357699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the lack of fractures, it&#8217;s expected that Porte will be able to resume training quickly and jump back into his planned spring schedule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tasmanian is a likely candidate for Ineos&#8217; always-powerful Tour de France squad, particularly after his career-best 3rd place finish in 2020. He was part of a raft of high-profile signings for the team that also included Adam Yates from Mitchelton-Scott, Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© stage winner Dani Martinez from EF, and Jumbo-Visma&#8217;s Laurens de Plus. With Egan Bernal expected to tackle the Giro d&#8217;Italia, Porte is expected to take a super domestique roll behind Geraint Thomas at the Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/richie-porte-escapes-broken-bones-but-is-beat-up-and-sore-after-paris-nice-crash/\">Richie Porte escapes broken bones but is &#8216;beat up and sore&#8217; after Paris-Nice crash</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4bf45ca9c1f9c88f265a79784cbbd1caacc882c6c364a5755ec4eeccc8e65167","category":"Cycling"}
