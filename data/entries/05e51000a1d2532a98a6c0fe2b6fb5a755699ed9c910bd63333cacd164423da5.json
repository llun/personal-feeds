Being present while this team worked all day in the sun and wind on its communityâ€™s bikes was a wonderful thing to witness, so expect some Reportage coming up next week. For now, I just wanted to say thank you to the entire Silver Stallion team for being such great hosts. Thank you.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"05e51000a1d2532a98a6c0fe2b6fb5a755699ed9c910bd63333cacd164423da5","category":"Cycling"}
