The days are longer, mudguards have long been removed and, for the most part, it’s warmer. On occasion, it’s too warm and, equally, sometimes it’s downright changeable, too.</p>\n<p>In this guide to summer cycling kit, we’ll run through what you need to stay cool and comfortable when hot weather hits, and what you need if the weather’s not playing ball.</p>\n<h2>Layers are still your friend</h2>\n<p>Summer cycling clothing should be adaptable, using thin layers that can be added or removed throughout the day as conditions dictate.</p>\n<p>Even in summer, morning can be cool, especially if you’re at altitude. Equally, conditions can change quickly and it pays to be prepared for summer storms or chilly descents.</p>\n<p>The focus should be on lightweight materials to help wick sweat away from the body and prevent that sticky, clammy feeling. Technical materials used for summer clothing also encourage ventilation to keep you cool.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A gilet can be easily stowed in a jersey pocket when not in use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Layers are key in winter, of course, but in cold weather it’s all about retaining warmth, often with an element of wind or water protection.</p>\n<p>As with most things in cycling, there’s lots of choice when it comes to summer cycling kit. What’s right for you will likely be determined by factors including the weather you typically encounter, how far you’re planning to ride, how hard you’ll be pushing yourself (and how much you’re sweating, as a result) and, as ever, budget.</p>\n<p>Let’s get on to the kit. We’ll run through each item, highlighting what to look out for and how to choose the right piece for you.</p>\n<h2>Summer cycling jersey</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A short-sleeve jersey is at the heart of any summer cycling ensemble.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Lightweight, short-sleeve jerseys are the best option for summer cycling. Look out for jerseys with mesh panels for ventilation, which make use of the airflow generated by the rider, and can help keep you cool on the move – even on a still day.</p>\n<p>While a standard summer jersey will work well for most conditions, some brands offer featherweight jerseys designed specifically for the hottest, most humid conditions, made from super-light fabrics that up ventilation once again.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/How-to-dress-for-summer-cycling-21-12693ab.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Look for lightweight fabrics to improve breathability.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/How-to-dress-for-summer-cycling-20-15450e6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>A full-length zip will allow you to vent the jersey while climbing.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In some climates, temperatures can fluctuate significantly within a day. Opting for a thin summer jersey and adding and removing layers as necessary will help you cope with any temperature changes. Instead of sticking to one jersey for the whole day, using layers can minimise sweating when it’s too hot and the chilling that may follow when you cool down again.</p>\n<p>You can layer up with a gilet, arm warmers or a lightweight jacket, as we’ll come on to, and all can be stashed in a jersey pocket.</p>\n<p>On that, almost all cycling jerseys will have three rear pockets, and look for a zipped pocket to stash small valuables.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/How-to-dress-for-summer-cycling-22-fcbfc3b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Rear pockets are a given but a small, zipped valuables pockets is a useful addition, too.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/How-to-dress-for-summer-cycling-10-b14f6d6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Elasticated sleeves will help keep the sleeves in place.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/How-to-dress-for-summer-cycling-11-42a23f8.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Same goes for the rear of the jersey.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>While many riders take pride in cycling tan lines, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-prevent-sunburn-when-youre-cycling/\">sunburn is an uncomfortable addition to a summer ride</a> – and not recommended.</p>\n<p>If your jersey is particularly lightweight, you may still be able to burn through the fabric. Some brands offer cycling-specific sun creams, which aim to last longer without wearing off when sweating.</p>\n<p>So, apply a high SPF suncream and don’t forget to do the same if you’ll be starting the day fully covered and removing layers as it heats up.</p>\n<p>We’ve got a separate guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-jerseys/\">best cycling jerseys</a>, and some top product picks.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Featured products</h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=18515&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fwomens-pro-team-training-jersey%2Fproduct%2FJTW01SSBPN\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha Women’s Pro Team Training Jersey</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=18515&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fmens-pro-team-flyweight-jersey%2Fproduct%2FPFY04XXRTT\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha Men’s Pro Team Flyweight Jersey</a></li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Summer baselayer</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Baselayers made from lightweight, synthetic fabrics will help wick sweat away from the body and dry quickly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Felix Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It may seem counterintuitive to add another layer when cycling in hot weather, but bear with us.</p>\n<p>Unlike thermal winter baselayers, a summer baselayer aims to wick sweat away from your body. In theory, this keeps you drier and cooler, making hot days more comfortable.</p>\n<p>Many brands offer specific summer baselayers, with both Merino and synthetic options available. Merino is a great option for cooler rides, and as a natural fabric has excellent wicking properties, but for really hot days we’d recommend a baselayer made from a lightweight, synthetic fabric that’s likely to be more affordable and quicker to dry.</p>\n<p>A mesh baselayer will be lighter still, while still helping to move sweat away from the body.</p>\n<p>Sleeveless baselayers remove extra bulk and weight around the armpit and work particularly well with close-fitting or aero jerseys, reducing the possibility of fabric bunching on the arms.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h4>Featured products</h4>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=18515&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fwomens-pro-team-mesh-base-layer-sleeveless%2Fproduct%2FSOM01SLDNY\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha Women’s Pro Team Mesh BaseLayer</a></li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Bib shorts</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You have two options when it comes to cycling shorts: waist shorts and bib shorts.
