However, due to corona, the Tour of Norway has already been postponed and it remains to be seen whether the other races he would ride will remain on the calendar.</p>\n<p>'With this solution we opt for more certainty, because after nine months without racing it is the intention for Dylan to return to competition.'</p>\n<p>Zeeman continued by admitting Groenewegen 'has no race rhythm' and 'will have to find his place in the peloton after everything that happened', which is the priority.</p>\n<p>Rather than targetting stage victories, it seems as if the four-time <a href=\"/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> stage winner will be tasked with a team leadership role looking after fellow sprinter David Dekker.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/canyon/aeroad/8789/canyon-aeroad-cfr-first-ride-review-canyon-s-fastest-bike-ever\">Canyon Aeroad CFR first ride review: Canyon’s fastest bike ever</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/3300/ultimate-time-trial-bikes-canyon-speedmax-cf-slx-90-ltd\">Ultimate time-trial bikes: Canyon Speedmax CF SLX 9.0 LTD</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8795/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-12-the-new-canyon-aeroad-and-why-aero-isnt-dead\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast Episode 12 – The new Canyon Aeroad and why aero isn't dead</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThe biggest challenege for Groenewegen beyond getting round the Giro will be the mental challenge of returning to the peloton. Last year, the <a href=\"/news/9154/dylan-groenewegen-required-police-protection-after-death-threats\">Dutchman revealed that he had been the victim of multiple death threats after the incident in Poland</a>.</p>\n<p>He told local media that the Dutch police had deployed officers to guard his doorstep after one individual posted a noose to Groenewegen instructing him to use it on his child.</p>\n<p>'I have received many heart-warming messages after all that has happened, but I am also taking into account some negative reactions on my return. That might happen anyway,' Groenewegen said.</p>\n<p>'I have spoken to Fabio before he went to Turkey and it was good to see how well he did there. I am very much looking forward to racing again myself too now and I am glad that I can do that in a beautiful race like the Giro d’Italia.'</p>\n<p>Jakobsen's return to the peloton at the Tour of Turkey earlier in the month was a successful one as he helped guide teammate <a href=\"/tags/mark-cavendish\">Mark Cavendish</a> to four stage victories. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"56861fcc6665d6c31da3150f598502de8e372415e8f1e72a41f284fb7885d516","category":"Cycling"}
