To ensure these apps responsibly handle sensitive data and provide reliable functionality, they must be submitted by developers working with entities recognized by public health authorities, such as test kit manufacturers, laboratories, or healthcare providers. As with other apps related to COVID-19, we also accept apps submitted directly by government, medical, and other credentialed institutions.</blockquote>Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/14/apple-reputable-covid-19-apps-only/\">restricting COVID 19-related apps</a> since March. Apps providing data on COVID must be submitted by developers working with recognized entities such as government organizations, health-focused NGOs, companies deeply credentialed in health issues, and medical or educational institutions. Apple does not allow COVID 19-themed entertainment or game apps, nor any other app not submitted by a qualified developer.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/exposure-notification/\">Exposure Notification</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/apple-health-pass-apps-limited-public-health/\">Apple Says COVID &#039;Health Pass&#039; Apps Are Limited to Developers Working With Public Health Authorities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-covid-health-pass-apps-are-limited-to-developers-working-with-public-health-authorities.2284978/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hhVoF5QMLTM:2Kw_ruaAzrg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hhVoF5QMLTM:2Kw_ruaAzrg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hhVoF5QMLTM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e24d60b02ea373e116fd914ed08740237a73664ad1abee6b318f608b6c42c842","category":"Apple"}
