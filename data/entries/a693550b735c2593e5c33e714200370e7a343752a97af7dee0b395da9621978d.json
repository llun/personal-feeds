Jenn runs <a href=\"https://www.wildcoastphoto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wild Coast Photo</a> and specializes in photographing elopements all over the world. With singletrack out their front door, a good, versatile hardtail is perfect for the trails around Taos, New Mexico, where Baphomet is based. Let’s look at this beaut below in detail…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-104.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-100.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice is its vibrant orange and blue paint scheme, with matching PNW <a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/products/loam-grips\" target=\"_blank\">Loam grips</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/collections/handlebars/products/the-range-stem-with-gopro-or-garmin-mount\" target=\"_blank\">Range Stem</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/collections/handlebars/products/range-handlebar-1\" target=\"_blank\">Range bars</a>, adding to the <a href=\"https://chrisking.com/collections/chris-king-headsets\" target=\"_blank\">Chris King Mango</a> pop. Dillen loves speccing PNW Components parts on his bikes because they’re affordable and durable. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-90.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-92.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The wild paint job is thanks to none other than <a href=\"http://www.darkmatterfinishing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Matter Finishing</a>. My favorite detail is the dropouts with their bright orange drips.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-91.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-93.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A SRAM Eagle GX drivetrain is accompanied by the 130mm travel Pike fork, meaty WTB Ranger 27.5×3.0″ tires, and WTB rims, laced to Chris King hubs, with a PNW Loam dropper. As for tubing, Dillen specs Columbus Tubing for all his bikes. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-86.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This bike looks so good in situ, right out in front of Dillen and Jenn’s beautiful and humble adobe, high in the mountains above Taos. As you can see, the trails were still muddy with fresh snowfall that morning, so we didn’t get to ride at all but with spring underway here, we’ll be making up for lost time together on the trails soon enough.</p>\n<p>With the posting of this bike, this concludes our <a href=\"https://www.baphometbicycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baphomet Bicycles</a> coverage.
