Just buy any Apple product capable of running the TV app (iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV) and you get Apple TV+ free for one year. Beginning July 1, that free trial period for new purchases will be reduced to three months, matching the Apple Arcade free trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until June 30 to purchase qualifying hardware and still get a free year of the service, which otherwise costs $4.99 a month. Apple TV+ is also included in every tier of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234604/apple-one-faq.html\">Apple One subscription bundle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change was quietly introduced in an update to the Apple TV+ marketing site. Apple still says you get a free year, but follows it with the detailed description, “when you purchase and activate an Apple device before June 30th, 2021.” That description links to a footnote that further clarifies the change: “Eligible devices activated July 1, 2021, or later will qualify for offers of 3 months free Apple TV+. Eligible devices activated on June 30, 2021, or earlier will qualify for offers of 12 months free Apple TV+.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/apple-tv-free-trial.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption>Apple now has an end date for its free-year offer.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s one-year free offer was extended twice as a way to keep subscribers from canceling while it struggled to release new, high-quality content. The COVID-19 pandemic caused big delays to new show launches and second-season premieres, but the service is back on its stride now. There are lots of upcoming Apple TV+ shows, including both new shows like <em>Physical</em> and <em>Schmigadoon!</em> and second seasons of early hits like <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and <em>See</em>. Some shows, like <em>Trying</em> and <em>Mythic Quest</em>, are already in their second season.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple TV 4K (2021)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-apple.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" /><div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347379/apple-tv-4k-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t32GB $179 | 64GB $199\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-tv/apple-tv-4k&amp;subid1=1-1-348852-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$179 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d0d0262fc40dcb0f3917bd9a6bdf39c2c2fa5bcaf6c3b38e6497146e28028334","category":"Apple"}
