Friesen turns and gestures at a silver contraption made of pipes and cylinders. “These are our machines,” she says. “This is where the material goes in.”</p>\n<p>Friesen is a cannabis extractor in Seattle. Her company, Heylo Cannabis, is part of a whole ecosystem of suppliers, processors and distributors that has sprouted up since Washington state legalized marijuana in 2012. In this food chain, Friesen is somewhere between the plant growers and the retailers that sell to consumers.

The result is a kind of oily, maple syrup–colored liquid that gently sloshes in glass flasks and jars in her lab.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768684#p3\">Read 40 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768684&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e0a40e080653574a7a443b6e7e3c4c84a31b10a395ea4f33e8d4473a383f16ac","category":"Tech"}
