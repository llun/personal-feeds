And those sorts of possibilities have huge implications for societies around the globe.</p>\n<p>The ice-sheet model that produced disturbing projections included new physical processes in its equations—they were obviously impactful, but their significance in the real world remains uncertain. Later <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/studies-question-worst-case-sea-level-rise-but-lower-rise-aint-great/\">research cast doubt</a> on its most extreme scenarios, but the Antarctic crystal ball hasn’t gotten a lot clearer.</p>\n<p>A pair of new studies published in Nature this week mark a new state of the art in ice modeling. Big questions about what we can expect are still there, and so planning for future sea level rise is still very much a matter of weighing risk under uncertainty.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763103#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763103&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scott K.
