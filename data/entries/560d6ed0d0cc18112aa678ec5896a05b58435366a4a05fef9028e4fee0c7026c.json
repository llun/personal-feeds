Along with the usual round of bug fixes and under-the-hood updates, the new build offers a couple of high-profile features—multiple Picture-in-Picture video-watching support, and (optional) stricter cookie separation, which Mozilla is branding <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/\">Total Cookie Protection</a>.</p>\n<h2>Taking Firefox 86 for a spin</h2>\n<p>Firefox 86 became the default <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/\">download</a> at mozilla.org on Tuesday—but as an Ubuntu 20.04 user, I didn't want to leave the Canonical-managed repositories just to test the new version. This is one scenario in which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/ubuntu-core-20-adds-secure-boot-with-hardware-backed-encryption/\">snaps</a> truly excel—providing you with a containerized version of an application, easily installed but guaranteed not to mess with your \"real\" operating system.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Firefox's snap channel didn't get the message about build 86 being the new default—the <code>latest/default</code> snap is still on build 85. In order to get the new version, I needed to <code>snap refresh firefox --channel=latest/candidate</code>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744857#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744857&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"560d6ed0d0cc18112aa678ec5896a05b58435366a4a05fef9028e4fee0c7026c","category":"Tech"}
