Apple offers two different training programs: 30-day foundation courses that cover specific topics, such as an introductory course on app development as a potential career path, and a more intensive 10- to 12-month academy program that takes a deeper look at coding and professional skills.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first Apple Developer Academy opened in Brazil in 2013, but since then, the company has opened more than a dozen academies across the globe, including sites in Indonesia and Italy, with two new academies on the way in Korea and Michigan. These expansion plans will give thousands more students access to educational opportunities each year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple revealed that as many as 51 nationalities are represented among Developer Academy graduates. More than 1,500 apps on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and more than 160 companies have been created by Apple Developer Academy graduates.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Our Apple Developer Academies have helped empower thousands of creators, coders and entrepreneurs around the world with skills for the jobs of tomorrow.
