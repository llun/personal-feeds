Apple offers two different training programs: 30-day foundation courses that cover specific topics, such as an introductory course on app development as a potential career path, and a more intensive 10- to 12-month academy program that takes a deeper look at coding and professional skills.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first Apple Developer Academy opened in Brazil in 2013, but since then, the company has opened more than a dozen academies across the globe, including sites in Indonesia and Italy, with two new academies on the way in Korea and Michigan. These expansion plans will give thousands more students access to educational opportunities each year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple revealed that as many as 51 nationalities are represented among Developer Academy graduates. More than 1,500 apps on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and more than 160 companies have been created by Apple Developer Academy graduates.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApplications for the first academy cohort in Detroit, Apple's first Developer Academy in the U.S., open this week via a <a href=\"https://developeracademy.msu.edu/students/\">form on the Michigan State University website</a>. All Michigan residents aged 18 and over are able to apply, regardless of prior coding experience.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNext month, Apple's annual <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">Worldwide Developers Conference</a> (WWDC) will take in an all-online format, featuring hundreds of sessions for developers to learn about new technologies, tools, and frameworks.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-academy/\">Apple Developer Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/michigan/\">Michigan</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/12/apple-expands-developer-academy-program/\">Apple Further Expands Developer Academy Program With First Detroit Applications Opening This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-further-expands-developer-academy-program-with-first-detroit-applications-opening-this-week.2295840/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8UBwfQXvO9A:ooF8tXb3NLY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8UBwfQXvO9A:ooF8tXb3NLY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8UBwfQXvO9A\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cb67332bdba7b97caa5f1ecbed1bef9e8bb58d3343a8ba7bc0253ba931ec6d6e","category":"Apple"}
