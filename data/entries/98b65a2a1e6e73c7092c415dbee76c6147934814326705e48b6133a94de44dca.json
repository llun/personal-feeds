The new feature allows a ZFS user to expand the size of a single RAIDz vdev. For example, you can use the new feature to turn a three-disk RAIDz1 into a four, five, or six RAIDz1.</p>\n<p>OpenZFS is a complex filesystem, and things are necessarily going to get a bit chewy explaining how the feature works. So if you're a ZFS newbie, you may want to refer back to our comprehensive ZFS 101 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/05/zfs-101-understanding-zfs-storage-and-performance/\">introduction</a>.</p>\n<h2>Expanding storage in ZFS</h2>\n<p>In addition to being a filesystem, ZFS is a storage array and volume manager, meaning that you can feed it a whole pile of disk devices, not just one. The heart of a ZFS storage system is the<code>zpool</code>—this is the most fundamental level of ZFS storage. The <code>zpool</code> in turn contains <code>vdevs</code>, and <code>vdevs</code> contain actual disks within them. Writes are split into units called <code>records</code> or <code>blocks</code>, which are then distributed semi-evenly among the <code>vdevs</code>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773486#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773486&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98b65a2a1e6e73c7092c415dbee76c6147934814326705e48b6133a94de44dca","category":"Tech"}
