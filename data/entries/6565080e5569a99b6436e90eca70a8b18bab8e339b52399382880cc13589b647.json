This timeframe has been rumored several times, with some reports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/27/ipad-pro-mini-led-first-quarter-2021/\">narrowing down a release to the first quarter</a>, so it is possible the new iPad Pro will be introduced in March.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/03/ipad-pro-5g-a14x-mini-led-2021-rumor/\">faster A14X chip and support for 5G networks</a> on models with cellular connectivity.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's unclear if Apple plans to introduce a new 11-inch iPad Pro at the same time, as many rumors have only mentioned the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. One possibility is that Mini-LED backlighting will be limited to the 12.9-inch model, with the 11-inch model's key new features limited to the A14X chip and 5G support, but it is unclear.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple will likely also adopt Mini-LED backlighting for new MacBook models to be unveiled in the second half of this year, according to the report. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models to launch in the second half of 2021 with a new design, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">return of an HDMI port and SD card reader</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">removal of the Touch Bar</a>, classic MagSafe charging with a breakaway power cable, and more.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/mini-led-ipad-pro-macbooks-ennostar/\">New iPad Pro and MacBook Models With Mini-LED Displays Again Rumored to Launch This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-and-macbook-models-with-mini-led-displays-again-rumored-to-launch-this-year.2285842/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gVUxwsJraas:357nSYJiTeo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gVUxwsJraas:357nSYJiTeo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gVUxwsJraas\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6565080e5569a99b6436e90eca70a8b18bab8e339b52399382880cc13589b647","category":"Apple"}
