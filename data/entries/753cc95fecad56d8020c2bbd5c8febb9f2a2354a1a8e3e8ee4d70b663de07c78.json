{"title":"DigiTimes: Apple to Announce Redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in September","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-macbook-pro-in-september/","date":1625125601000,"content":"After months of rumors and speculation, Apple plans to announce its redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro featuring mini-LED displays, an all-new design, and a faster Apple silicon processor in September of this year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210701PD201.html\">report from <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-render.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the paywalled report, which revealed that Apple is planning a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-investing-mini-led-upcoming-macbook-pro/\">significant investment</a> in bolstering mini-LED production, Apple plans to unveil its redesigned MacBook Pros in the late portion of the third quarter of this year. The third quarter runs July through September, and Apple has typically reserved product announcements during the summer for its annual <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> event, which traditionally occurs in September.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman recently indicated that the next few weeks will be quiet as Apple is not planning any major announcement or product reveals until the launch of its new iPhones in the fall. That reporting would corroborate <em>DigiTimes'</em> claim of a late third-quarter launch, likely happening in September.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DigiTimes</em> further reports today that shipments of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will peak in October. Shipments peaking in October makes the likelihood of a September announcement even greater, given that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/apple-extra-suppliers-for-mini-led-displays/\">suppliers of mini-LED displays continue to run dry</a>. Like the M1-powered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> launch, Apple may announce the new MacBook Pros during an event in September but not yet begin shipping the device until later the next month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pros will feature the most radical redesign to the MacBook line in recent years. The new MacBook Pros are expected to feature a flat-edged design, more ports, including HDMI and an SD-card slot reader, a faster iteration of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon chip, and brighter and more vibrant displays thanks to the inclusion of mini-LED technology.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can learn more about everything we know about the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/#whats_next_for_the_macbook_pro\">using our guide</a>. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes/\">digitimes</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/01/apple-macbook-pro-in-september/\">DigiTimes: Apple to Announce Redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro in September</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/digitimes-apple-to-announce-redesigned-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-in-september.2302899/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mZDJmtsnYDQ:2PtG9_4qI4E:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mZDJmtsnYDQ:2PtG9_4qI4E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mZDJmtsnYDQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"753cc95fecad56d8020c2bbd5c8febb9f2a2354a1a8e3e8ee4d70b663de07c78","category":"Apple"}
