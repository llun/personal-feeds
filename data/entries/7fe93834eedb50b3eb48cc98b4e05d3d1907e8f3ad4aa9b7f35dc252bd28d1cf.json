The site paid a hacker &#36;16 to reroute texts using the tools of a company called Sakari, which helps businesses with mass marketing.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSakari offered a text rerouting tool from a company called Bandwidth, which was supplied by another company called NetNumber, resulting in a confusing network of companies contributing to a vulnerability that left SMS texts open to hackers (<em>Motherboard</em> has <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber\">more information</a> on the process in its original article). The hacker hired by <em>Motherboard</em> was able to access Sakari's tools without any authentication or consent from the rerouting target, successfully getting texts from <em>Motherboard</em>'s test phone.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSakari is meant to allow businesses to import their own phone number for sending mass texts, which means a business is able to add a phone number to send and receive texts through the Sakari platform. Hackers could abuse this tool by importing a phone number of a victim to get access to the person's text messages.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAerialink, a communications company that helps route text messages, <a href=\"http://status.aerialink.net\">said today</a> said that wireless carriers are no longer supporting SMS or MMS text enabling on wireless numbers, something that \"affects all SMS providers in the mobile ecosystem.\" This will prevent the hack demonstrated by <em>Motherboard</em> last week from working.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is not clear if this text rerouting method was widely used by hackers, but it was easier to pull off than other smartphone hacking methods like SIM swapping. A Security Research Labs researcher said that he had not seen it before, while another researcher said it was \"absolutely\" in use.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/sms-routing-vulnerability-fix/\">U.S. Carriers Fix SMS Routing Vulnerability That Let Hackers Hijack Texts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-carriers-fix-sms-routing-vulnerability-that-let-hackers-hijack-texts.2289625/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Fs2EaJc7gf0:Sm1qX_12W2o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Fs2EaJc7gf0:Sm1qX_12W2o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Fs2EaJc7gf0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fe93834eedb50b3eb48cc98b4e05d3d1907e8f3ad4aa9b7f35dc252bd28d1cf","category":"Apple"}
