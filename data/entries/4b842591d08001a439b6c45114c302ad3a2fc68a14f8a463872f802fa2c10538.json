It was the smallest Mac with a Retina display, and it also featured a fanless design.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple continued updating the 12-inch MacBook in 2016 and 2017, but ultimately <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/\">discontinued it in 2019</a> in favor of the updated ‌MacBook Air‌ with Retina display as the two machines were quite similar. When it was available, the 12-inch MacBook was priced at $1,299.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor most vintage products, the designation means that they're no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar or from Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple does offer extended repairs of select vintage products. Devices are considered vintage when Apple stopped distributing them for sale more than five and less than seven years ago.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/retina-macbook-vintage-products-list/\">Apple Adds 2015 12-Inch Retina MacBook to Vintage Products List</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-2015-12-inch-retina-macbook-to-vintage-products-list.2302850/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SO0YHdvHJDI:za3MCrCE54U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SO0YHdvHJDI:za3MCrCE54U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SO0YHdvHJDI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b842591d08001a439b6c45114c302ad3a2fc68a14f8a463872f802fa2c10538","category":"Apple"}
