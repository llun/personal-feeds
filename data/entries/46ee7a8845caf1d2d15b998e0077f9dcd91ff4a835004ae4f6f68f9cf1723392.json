This could even be done at random,\nand would seriously call the data integrity of Cellebrite’s\nreports into question.</p>\n\n<p>Any app could contain such a file, and until Cellebrite is able to\naccurately repair all vulnerabilities in its software with\nextremely high confidence, the only remedy a Cellebrite user has\nis to not scan devices. Cellebrite could reduce the risk to their\nusers by updating their software to stop scanning apps it\nconsiders high risk for these types of data integrity problems,\nbut even that is no guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>We are of course willing to responsibly disclose the specific\nvulnerabilities we know about to Cellebrite if they do the same\nfor all the vulnerabilities they use in their physical\nextraction and other services to their respective vendors, now\nand in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lots more than this — including the fact that Cellebrite is embedding DLLs from Apple in their software.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/21/signal-strikes-back\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"46ee7a8845caf1d2d15b998e0077f9dcd91ff4a835004ae4f6f68f9cf1723392","category":"Tech"}
