While it's still known as the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) and includes an array of HoloLens-like sensors, the model seen in today's announcement appears to attach to a helmet. Ars previously reported that Microsoft and the US Army intended for this headset to not require mounting on a helmet, arguably to increase its applicability.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753570#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753570&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca2274d123df51fbece930309bb2e745c49d864a61747625e0ff5a239b71d93b","category":"Tech"}
