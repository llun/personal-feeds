Today's new report echoes a similar story but offers more details on the performance of this upcoming high-end Mac. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> says there are two new ‌Mac Pro‌ models in the works, both featuring a redesign and are planned to \"come in 20 or 40 computing core variations, made up of 16 high-performance or 32 high-performance cores and four or eight high-efficiency cores.\"\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Codenamed Jade 2C-Die and Jade 4C-Die, a redesigned ‌Mac Pro‌ is planned to come in 20 or 40 computing core variations, made up of 16 high-performance or 32 high-performance cores and four or eight high-efficiency cores. The chips would also include either 64 core or 128 core options for graphics. The computing core counts top the 28 core maximum offered by today’s Intel ‌Mac Pro‌ chips, while the higher-end graphics chips would replace parts now made by Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</blockquote>Alongside the faster, more powerful processor, the new ‌Mac Pro‌ will feature a smaller design that \"could invoke nostalgia for the Power Mac G4 Cube,\" according to a previous <em>Bloomberg</em> report. Apple is also working on a successor to the current ‌Mac Pro‌ design that may use Intel processors rather than its own Apple silicon.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg/\">Bloomberg</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/18/bloomberg-mac-pro-32-high-performance-cores/\">Bloomberg: Apple Silicon Mac Pro May Feature Up to 32 High Performance Cores, 128 Core Option for Graphics</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-apple-silicon-mac-pro-may-feature-up-to-32-high-performance-cores-128-core-option-for-graphics.2296635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vPXL899uP2s:iWRXjmD0El0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vPXL899uP2s:iWRXjmD0El0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/vPXL899uP2s\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"052593509e4fdb320b47b8b134af39cb50407b538f38cd2553c7c2604739dd5d","category":"Apple"}
