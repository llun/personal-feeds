And it’s an utter triumph, packing stacks of style, high-end detailing, enough storage to render a backpack obsolete and cleverly engineered breathability to keep you cooler on the bike.</p>\n<p>The only barrier to happy ownership is going to be the price.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9531/belstaff-commuter-jacket-photos#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/belstaff_commuter_jacket_2.jpg?itok=EvFjbDXe\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Cool commuter</h3>\n<p>You wouldn’t expect a 170g waxed cotton jacket to be the most breathable of cycling kit, but this is where the Belstaff Commuter jacket has a trick up its sleeve. Or rather, under it.</p>\n<p>Lengthy zips, perfectly applied so as to hinder neither movement nor comfort, run the length of the underarms, hidden under weatherproof flaps when not in use, yet unzipping to reveal an open mesh venting slit when it’s hot in the city.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9531/belstaff-commuter-jacket-photos#7\"><p><span>Image 8 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/belstaff_commuter_jacket_7.jpg?itok=JTpWMwok\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 8 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>These underarm coolers are complemented by a similarly concealed exhaust vent across the upper back, which spirits away accumulated hot air to mitigate inner-city claminess.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.belstaff.co.uk/men/outerwear/waxed-jackets/commuter-waxed-cotton-jacket-black/B000147143.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Belstaff Commuter jacket now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Of course, the outer fabric is as wind and waterproof as you’d expect, making this a truly year-round proposition. Additionally, an internal drawstring cinches the waist for a secure fit.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9531/belstaff-commuter-jacket-photos#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/belstaff_commuter_jacket_3.jpg?itok=C5gSt71Z\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Packing it all in</h3>\n<p>Mirroring the carrying capacity of more traditional ‘country-type’ waxed outerwear, the Belstaff Commuter jacket is blessed with four exceptionally deep front outer pockets, secured with beefy press studs.</p>\n<p>In practice, believe it or not, they will securely carry a well folded pair of shorts, T-shirt, wallet, mobile phone, notebook, several pens and a sunglasses case – with plenty of room to spare. On top of that, the rear zipped pocket near the hem swallows a pair of size 42 low-top trainers or office shoes – it’s a phenomenal achievement.</p>\n<p>And if you need somewhere to stash valuables you’d rather not have in the outer compartments, there are a further three internal stowage compartments.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9531/belstaff-commuter-jacket-photos#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/belstaff_commuter_jacket_5.jpg?itok=VfT_HP4s\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>All in the detail</h3>\n<p>The Belstaff Commuter jacket is not a case of form over function. The closer you look, and the more you wear it, the more apparent its cycling suitability becomes. From the reflective panelling on the secure, adjustable, press-stud-fastened cuffs, the rear of the collar, and the back pocket, to the lower-cut rear hem designed to offer protection once you’re on the bike, details abound to make urban riding that much easier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.belstaff.co.uk/men/outerwear/waxed-jackets/commuter-waxed-cotton-jacket-black/B000147143.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Belstaff Commuter jacket now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The comfort is beyond reproach, with a high-cut, soft corduroy collar, casual fit in the arms for freedom of movement, and of course that adjustable waist, which I did have to loosen off a tad once the outer pockets were bulging.</p>\n<p>A dash of ‘if you know, you know’ style is added by the <em>de rigeur</em> Black Watch tartan lining, complemented by microfibre panelling.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9531/belstaff-commuter-jacket-photos#11\"><p><span>Image 12 of</span> 12</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/belstaff_commuter_jacket_11.jpg?itok=XeAr2G4H\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 12 of </span>12</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Wax on, wax off</h3>\n<p>The yin to the Belstaff Commuter jacket’s yang is its price: £550 is undoubtedly more than most folk will spend on a cycling jacket.</p>\n<p>However, there will be people for whom it represents not only a supremely suitable garment for rides that don’t require a backpack (which, when worn, does hinder the function of the rear vent) but also what the fashion industry likes to call ‘an investment piece’.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/2055/the-best-mens-worldtour-team-kits-for-2021\">The best men's WorldTour team kits for 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nI’ve little doubt this is a jacket you’ll still be wearing a decade after purchase – and not only on the bike.
