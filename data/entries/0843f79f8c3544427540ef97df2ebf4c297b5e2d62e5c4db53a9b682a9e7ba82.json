The setting is off by default.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOn devices with the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" setting turned off, all apps that request to track are denied permission by default and cannot access the device's random advertising identifier, known as the IDFA.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApps are also not permitted to track your activity using other information that identifies you or your device, such as your email address, although this policy is not enforced at a technical level.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025\">says</a> there are a few circumstances where the setting may be legitimately grayed out, but a significant minority of users had still found that they were unable to adjust the setting despite meeting Apple's criteria for full access.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/apple-releases-ios-14-5-1/\">May 3 update</a> from Apple had been expected to fix the problem, but reports from users unable to control the feature persisted  after the update was installed. Based on the latest reports from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justleemar/status/1394806714516529152?s=20\">social media</a>, however, Apple appears to be resolving the issue.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShortly after ATT was launched, an early analysis <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/07/most-iphone-users-app-tracking-opt-out/\">suggested</a> that 96% of iOS users did not plan to allow tracking for any app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-app-tracking-transparency-video/\">shared a video</a> with more details about its new App Tracking Transparency requirement for those interested in learning more.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/apple-fix-for-grey-out-app-tracking-toggle/\">Apple Rolling Out Fix for Greyed Out App Tracking Transparency Toggle</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rolling-out-fix-for-greyed-out-app-tracking-transparency-toggle.2296744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PJ2W-31QFfU:1Cv-V3pe9Co:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PJ2W-31QFfU:1Cv-V3pe9Co:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PJ2W-31QFfU\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0843f79f8c3544427540ef97df2ebf4c297b5e2d62e5c4db53a9b682a9e7ba82","category":"Apple"}
