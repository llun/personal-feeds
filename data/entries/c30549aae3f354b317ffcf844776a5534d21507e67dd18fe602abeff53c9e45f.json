The unique first-person photos and videos Olsen posted from \"inside\" Big Shell—and the account's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Metalgear/status/1382399008816046081\">interaction with the official <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> Twitter account</a>—have led many to assume that \"Tom Olsen\" is a viral marketing campaign for an as-yet-unannounced <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> remake.</p>\n<p>No such luck. Instead, the account is the creation of a lone fan and self-described \"Metal Gear Solid historian\" who seems to be reveling a bit in the rumors and speculation he's driving.</p>\n<h2>How rumors get started</h2>\n<p>Tom Olsen's Twitter account describes him as a \"born and bred NYer. Maintenance Technician at the Big Shell. Married 10 years to my wonderful wife Karen. Recovering Mets fan.\" So far, the account has amassed nearly 4,000 followers despite <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheTomOlsen/following\">only following four accounts</a>: three related to Konami and <em>MGS</em> and one for the New York Mets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760081#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760081&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c30549aae3f354b317ffcf844776a5534d21507e67dd18fe602abeff53c9e45f","category":"Tech"}
