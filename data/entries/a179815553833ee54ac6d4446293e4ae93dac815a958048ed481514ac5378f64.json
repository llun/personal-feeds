Netflix instead says it was testing multi-channel support for built-in speakers, as part of its mission to \"improve\" its service, and evaluate \"new experiences\" for users. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNetflix and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> users have been on edge, waiting for the streaming giant to adopt the feature. The pressure on Netflix isn't made any lighter given the fact that a number of its biggest competitors such as Disney Plus, HBO Max, and of course, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, all already include Spatial audio support.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSpatial audio brings three-dimensional sound to your &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. Your iOS device will compare its own data from the gyroscope and accelerometer against the data from your &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, to ensure that your sound field stays anchored to the device even if you move your head.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/netflix-not-testing-spatial-audio/\">Netflix Says It&#039;s Not Testing Spatial Audio Support for AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-says-its-not-testing-spatial-audio-support-for-airpods.2285789/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JhgcB8oyLa4:TsUk0tbs1C4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JhgcB8oyLa4:TsUk0tbs1C4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JhgcB8oyLa4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a179815553833ee54ac6d4446293e4ae93dac815a958048ed481514ac5378f64","category":"Apple"}
