It also features an exhibition centre – what Rapha calls an ‘experiential space’ – to celebrate the culture of cycling.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, the cafe area has been enlarged with a view to making it a hub for the London riding community. Rapha boasts that it is now the largest cycling club in the world, with 20,000 members worldwide, and while the brand’s main aim remains to sell jerseys and bibshorts, the expanded Clubhouse is plainly seen as meeting space and social focal point.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/rapha/9476/rapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rapha_in_store_051_.jpg?itok=XI53VRuK\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>To encourage participation, Rapha organises rides from the Clubhouse every day of the week, including beginners’ sessions and women-only rides.</p>\n<p>It is also planning a series of exhibitions, starting with ‘Stitches in Time’, a look back at all the different jerseys the brand has produced in its 17-year history.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/rapha/9476/rapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos#19\"><p><span>Image 20 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rapha-stitches-0684-final_crop.jpg?itok=5sG5JWNc\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 20 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/sram/9405/sram-rival-etap-axs\">Sram Rival eTap AXS: bringing wireless electronic shifting to the masses</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9485/bontrager-aeolus-rsl-its-fastest-wheels-ever\">Bontrager Aeolus RSL: its 'fastest wheels ever'</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9490/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-29-johan-museeuw-the-lion-of-flanders\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast Episode 29 – Johan Museeuw, the Lion of Flanders</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/1671/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">Buyer's guide to road bike groupsets </a></div>    </div></div><p>\nSimon Mottram, Rapha Founder and CEO, says, ‘Rapha Clubhouses exist for customers to find the products they want but also to help them get closer to the cycling community and closer to the sport itself.</p>\n<p>‘So it’s great that we will now have more space to host exhibitions and events and a better-appointed cafe for London’s cyclists to enjoy, along with room to show our entire product range.’ </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/rapha/9476/rapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos\">Rapha London Clubhouse reopening photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>12 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Frapha%2F9476%2Frapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Rapha%20London%20Clubhouse%20reopening%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Frapha%2F9476%2Frapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Rapha%20London%20Clubhouse%20reopening%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Frapha%2F9476%2Frapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Rapha%20London%20Clubhouse%20reopening%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Frapha%2F9476%2Frapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/rapha/9476/rapha-london-clubhouse-reopening-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/rapha_in_store_003_.jpg?itok=eVZ3jqSM\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/destinations\">Destinations</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/clothing\">Clothing</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/tags/rapha\">Rapha</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/destinations\">Destinations</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5b7f5bb5ae72c4d2a476c3ffe567e6ff2e0dec5924756846627f3a9dc396629c","category":"Cycling"}
