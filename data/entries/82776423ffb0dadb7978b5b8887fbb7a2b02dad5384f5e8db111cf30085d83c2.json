The higher-end configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of Fusion Drive storage is currently unavailable for pickup entirely, but is available for delivery. Regardless of configuration, Apple lists at least five to seven business days for shipping estimates.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe higher-end 21.5-inch ‌iMac‌ with a 4K display is also experiencing a lack of availability at a few stores nationwide; however, it largely remains in stock. The larger 27-inch ‌iMac‌ remains available as normal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLast month <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/\">Apple discontinued two configurations</a> of the standard 21.5-inch ‌iMac‌, possibly making way for new stock.
