You may need the serial number of this item.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn its announcement today, Samsung also explained that its Bixby voice assistant can now be used to find SmartTags based on their custom name and direct the user to their location with an audible alert. Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> is likely to offer similar functionality with ‌AirTags‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div><div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/07/apple-announces-find-my-network-third-party-devices/\">already opened up</a> its ‌Find My‌ network for third-party accessories makers to take advantage of ultra-wideband technology in Apple devices. Under the network, accessory makers will tap into the ‌Find My‌ ecosystem, allowing customers to track their items on their iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌‌AirTags‌‌ have been rumored to be launching for months now, and the most recent hope is that they will be unveiled later today during Apple's \"Spring Loaded\" virtual event. The event kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time via a live stream on Apple's website and YouTube channel. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you can't watch the live stream, you can follow along for full coverage of all of the announcements from the event on <a href=\"https://macrumors.com/\"><em>MacRumors.com</em></a> or follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive</a> for our live tweet coverage.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/samsung-smartthings-prevent-tracker-stalking/\">Samsung SmartThings Update Aims to Prevent Tracker-Based Stalking</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-smartthings-update-aims-to-prevent-tracker-based-stalking.2292292/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZXgg0otaM5A:glBpSesbcAY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZXgg0otaM5A:glBpSesbcAY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZXgg0otaM5A\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e8e8918ea85ba8a170a4524df963d844ed507fbdd4355e8861f5711d8f8c00f9","category":"Apple"}
