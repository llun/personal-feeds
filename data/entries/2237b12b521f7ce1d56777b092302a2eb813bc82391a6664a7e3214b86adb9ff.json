As Tim Merlier (Alpecin-Fenix) jumped out of the saddle start his sprint just behind Philipsen and just in front of Ewan, Ewan lost control, possibly clipping Merlier’s rear wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the 26-year-old Australian fell to his left side, he took Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) down with him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merlier went on to take the stage win. Sagan was quickly back up, but Ewan remained on the ground for quite some time, clearly in pain. He did not finish the stage, ultimately abandoning the race and being taken away in an ambulance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the stage, Lotto-Soudal confirmed that Ewan had suffered a broken collarbone in the crash.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/caleb-ewan-is-out-of-the-tour-de-france-with-a-fractured-collarbone/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2237b12b521f7ce1d56777b092302a2eb813bc82391a6664a7e3214b86adb9ff","category":"Cycling"}
