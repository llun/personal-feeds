What would <em>Pac-Man</em> be like if 99 people played the game at the same time, and only one pellet muncher emerged victorious?</p>\n<p>The new game, creatively titled <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pac-man-99-switch/\"><em>Pac-Man 99</em></a>, arrives on the evening of Wednesday, April 7, as a free download for paying subscribers to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/\">the Nintendo Switch Online service</a>. Its resemblance to 2019's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/tetris-99-isnt-just-a-great-twist-on-a-classic-its-a-gameplay-revolution/\"><em>Tetris 99</em></a> and 2020's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/marios-early-levels-wear-out-their-welcome-in-super-mario-bros-35/\"><em>Super Mario 35</em></a> is no accident, since it has been designed with the same \"NintendoWare Bezel Engine\" used in those other gamesâ€”and that framework appears to cleverly juggle simultaneous sessions of competitive <em>Pac-Man</em>.</p>\n<h2>Jammers, ghost trains, and boosts</h2>\n<p>As seen in the game's surprise reveal on Tuesday evening, <em>Pac-Man 99</em>'s default online mode resembles the oldest-school version of <em>Pac-Man</em>, in terms of chasing ghosts and chomping yellow dots on the series' earliest black-and-blue maze. Like <em>Tetris 99</em> before it, <em>Pac-Man 99</em> plays a lot like its traditional source material, only with fields of online players interfering with each other's progress. You send attacks to other players' fields (visible on the screen's edges as smaller windows) by eating power pellets and then devouring vulnerable ghosts. They do the same to you.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755026#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755026&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7670c30f8e0bb4b60173be4c2754d3912df9d49753fbf651197a54ec8a11cc68","category":"Tech"}
