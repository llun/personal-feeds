Today's presentation included a welcome surprise:Â <em>double</em> the included games. Now, Playdate owners can expect to get two games a week as free downloads over a span of 12 weeks (which, if my calculator is correct, means 24 games in all).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771249#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771249&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4bcc52aea7ce352b80eb6285dead127a4f37b0f29028e0aa33e0f13e5e2f21f","category":"Tech"}
