Homebrew doesn't (yet) provide bottles for all packages on &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; that we do on Intel x86_64 but we welcome your help in doing so. Rosetta 2 on &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; still provides support for Intel x86_64 in /usr/local.</blockquote>Homebrew, for those unfamiliar with the software, is a package manager like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a>. It's designed to let users quickly and easily install, uninstall, and update apps using Terminal.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPrior to now, Homebrew was able to run on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Macs through Rosetta 2, but now it works on the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> natively. Homebrew doesn't yet support bottles for all packages on Apple silicon that are available on x86_64, but improvements will be made in the future.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Homebrew developer Mike McQuaid, the 3.0.0 development was helped along by MacStadium and Apple, with Apple providing hardware and migration help.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/homebrew-apple-silicon-support/\">Open Source Package Management Software Homebrew Gains Native Apple Silicon Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/open-source-package-management-software-homebrew-gains-native-apple-silicon-support.2283470/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7pYv56M6oec:7qHcjZLzVSI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7pYv56M6oec:7qHcjZLzVSI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7pYv56M6oec\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5ba6190db75af4d089cb76ce43f91fb8f1ead87eb15e2519747dc257b313643c","category":"Apple"}
