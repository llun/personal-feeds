(EA has made very clear that these are \"cinematic\" pictures, not captures from real-time gameplay.)                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>As part of this week's E3-like slew of game news and reveals, EA has taken the wraps off one of its most unsurprising games of the year: <em>Battlefield 2042</em>. But don't get too excited. The word \"reveal\" should be taken with a grain of salt, as we really don't know a ton about how the game will work—and expect that EA will play fans like fiddles via a slow news trickle until the game's launch on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation on October 22.</p>\n<p>For now, the game's developers at DICE have confirmed that this is indeed a recognizable <em>Battlefield</em> game, complete with massive team combat, the return of popular objective-based modes, and aspirations to deliver the series' biggest battle arenas yet. I've been at Ars long enough to hear <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/battlefield-v-looks-amazing-and-it-wont-have-paid-season-pass-map-packs/\">that</a> very <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/battlefield-1-review-we-found-this-years-top-notch-fps-combat/\">promise</a> three <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/battlefield-4-the-brutal-broken-beautiful-pinnacle-of-first-person-shooters/\">times</a>, and to its credit, DICE's staff tends to deliver on increased battling scope with every major installment.</p>\n<p>The biggest change this time is finally—<em>fiiiiinally</em>—cranking the maximum player count up to 128 combatants on a single, super-sized map in the game's PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 versions. The series has famously maxed out at 64 players since its very first entry, and over the years, DICE reps have explained away the limitation by saying <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/25/dice-talks-battlefield-v-crossplay-hardcore-mode-and-why-the-player-count-stays-at-64\">more players doesn't always mean more fun</a>. But those statements largely came before a certain 100-player genre changed everything, and last week, DICE showed high-level pans of a few upcoming maps to prove out its design philosophy: discrete zones that teams can divide-and-conquer throughout, instead of lumping that many players into hallways of death.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771667#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771667&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"511ac253476215a3dcece152da214e5c7d69d71e1713b75106cabed62c0ec4f2","category":"Tech"}
