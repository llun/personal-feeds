As we slowly emerge from our domiciles, here’s a head check on the only custom bicycle show in the World this year – the <a href=\"http://www.handmadebicycleshow.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Handmade Bicycle Show Australia</a>, or as I often refer, the show of bikes I’d love to own, but currently can’t afford (them all).<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6547.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The venue was the amazing Seaworks in Williamstown, a chance selection by Event Director, Nathan Lorkin, who lives around the corner.   Perched by the watery inlet of Melbourne’s port, seeing the city from an unfamiliar angle was a great backdrop, and access was easy – some even choosing to take a punt across the waters to the show.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6055.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It’s been <a href=\"https://fyxo.co/blogs/fyxo/handmade-bicycle-show-australia-2019\" target=\"_blank\">2 years</a> between drinks – and displays from the best in the land.  A solid representation from foundation attendees and an influx of new names made a wander through the hall an engaging experience.   The simple aesthetic of the show makes bump-in and out for builders a breeze, and I love the democracy of it, allowing exhibits and builders to shine on the merit of their wares and not elaborate staging.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6015.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The number of frame builders was at an all-time high and would have been higher if not for some last-minute withdrawals and International names unable to attend.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6033.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The hunger from the public was also reflected in a near doubling of foot traffic from 2019.  Nearly 2,500 cycling enthusiasts came through over the 3-day event.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6475.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Friday night was buzzing with energy, enthusiasm, perhaps just the novelty of being in a room with so many people again – without masks, to enjoy conversation face to face.   The highlight for me was seeing the incredible standard across the board.   The formidable standard set by long terms brands like <a href=\"https://www.baumcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Baum</a> (celebrating their 25th of manufacture), and <a href=\"http://www.llewellynbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Llewellyn</a> (42 years) must be intimidating, but some of the New Kids on the Block certainly didn’t let it show – like <a href=\"https://www.sugarloafcycles.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Sugarloaf Cycles</a> of Brisbane, and their handmade carbon road bike and a trio of steel beauties from <a href=\"https://www.thelostworkshop.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Workshop</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6052.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Road still dominates, but Gravel is locked on its wheel, and only one track bike from <a href=\"https://www.vechter.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Vechter</a> graced the venue, yet a decade ago track bikes dominated the stands.  To suit my own whims,  I’d love to see more custom mountain bikes, and it was great to see a quartet at the show from <a href=\"https://torbikes.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Tor’s</a> custom all-mountain bike, <a href=\"https://www.curvecycling.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Curve Cycling’s</a> Downrock in long haul mode, Sean Doyle’s (<a href=\"https://devlincc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Devlin Custom</a>) own trail bike, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trinity_mtb/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Trinity MTB</a>‘s prototype frame with 170mm of rear travel, designed around the <a href=\"https://www.cavalerie-bikes.com/affigear-en\" target=\"_blank\">effigearbox</a>.  Those who like going fast and getting sideways may be familiar with one of Trinity’s designers – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/engineeredtoslide/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Engineered to Slide</a>.  Go down that wormhole of cool if you dare.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6042.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Other highlights for me was chatting with <a href=\"https://www.pennyfarthingdan.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Pennyfarthing Dan</a>, a welcome inclusion on craftsmanship alone.  His passion for the Penny was the same as <a href=\"https://www.gelliecustombikeframes.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Gellie</a> and his gravel bikes, <a href=\"https://www.velocraft.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Velocraft</a> and their paint, or <a href=\"https://www.bastioncycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bastion</a> and their amazing new 3D integrated cockpit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6038.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It was also great to see many parts and accessories from local makers.  <a href=\"https://terrarosagear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Terra Rosa Gear</a> for their recrafted adventure hardware,  <a href=\"http://olasdesign.com.au/products/gh-bike-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">Olas</a> and their beautiful timber sculptures which double as a bike rack, <a href=\"https://www.passchier.co.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">Passchier</a> with their range of bamboo laminated bars,  and <a href=\"https://www.partington.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Partington</a> with their world-class handmade carbon wheelsets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-6043.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the show was that the hundreds of people I asked ‘What’s your favourite?’ they all had a different answer.   Maybe it’s no surprise as custom bikes are a reflection of the cyclists who ride them.  All different, all unique, and all wonderful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/FYXO-5937.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>We’ve narrowed the bikes down to two
