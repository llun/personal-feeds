For reference, the microSD card included in the deal typically retails around $25 online. The offer is available at several retailers and, according to <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-online-family-membership-12-month-digital%2F-%2FA-54259091&amp;subid1=dealmaster061521\" target=\"_blank\">Target's listing</a>, will expire June 19.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, Nintendo's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/\" target=\"_blank\">paid online service</a> isn't quite as essential for Switch owners as Sony's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft's Xbox Live are for their respective platforms, which tend to put a greater emphasis on multiplayer games as whole. Still, a membership is required to utilize the online components of several (but not all) Switch games—including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/mario-kart-8-is-still-great-in-its-deluxe-switch-edition/\"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a>,<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/smash-bros-ultimate-review-the-best-fighting-game-on-any-nintendo-system/\"><em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>,<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/overwatch/\"><em> Overwatch</em></a>, and the like—and make cloud save backups. It gives access to more than 100 mostly-well-regarded <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/nintendo-entertainment-system-nintendo-switch-online-switch/\" target=\"_blank\">NES</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-nintendo-switch-online-switch/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Nintendo</a> games, too, as well a couple of inventive battle royale games like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/tetris-99-isnt-just-a-great-twist-on-a-classic-its-a-gameplay-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">Tetris 99</a> </em>and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/nintendo-switch-continues-the-retro-battle-royale-trend-with-pac-man-99/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pac-Man 99</em></a>. Note that this deal specifically applies to a Family Membership, which <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41202\" target=\"_blank\">can cover</a> up to eight different Switch users in a designated \"<a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22324\" target=\"_blank\">family group</a>.\" If you're only buying for yourself, a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gxKxEQ\" target=\"_blank\">12-month solo membership</a> still goes for $20.</p>\n<p>The microSD card, meanwhile, is SanDisk's officially licensed and plainly named microSDXC Card for Nintendo Switch, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/the-best-nintendo-switch-accessories-you-can-buy/#h7\" target=\"_blank\">which we've recommended in the past</a>. It's a UHS-I card with a <a href=\"https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/\" target=\"_blank\">U3 or V30 speed rating</a>—not the fastest option on the market, but speedy enough to comfortably record 4K video and plenty capable of stashing and running games on the current Switch hardware. A microSD card is still borderline essential for Switch owners given that the console only comes with 32GB of storage on its own; this one has remained quick and dependable in our long-term testing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773434#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773434&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0dce8629865a90a91b6793a7767ce5df25bdab7b84d56c6ed8ef01195181dc7e","category":"Tech"}
