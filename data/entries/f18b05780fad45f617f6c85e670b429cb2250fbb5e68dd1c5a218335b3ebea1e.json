In granting SpaceX's request, the Federal Communications Commission dismissed opposition from Viasat, Hughes, Dish Network, OneWeb, the Amazon subsidiary known as Kuiper, and other satellite companies that claimed the change would cause too much interference with other systems.</p>\n<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/spacex-gets-fcc-approval-to-build-worldwide-satellite-broadband-network/\">SpaceX received FCC approval</a> to launch 4,425 broadband satellites at orbits of 1,110 km to 1,325 km. Today's FCC <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-grants-spacexs-satellite-broadband-modification-application\">order granting</a> SpaceX's license-change request lowers the altitude for 2,814 of the satellites, letting them orbit in the 540-570 km range.Â Today's FCC order will also let SpaceX use a lower elevation angle for antennas on user terminals and gateway Earth stations.</p>\n<p>\"Based on our review, we agree with SpaceX that the modification will improve the experience for users of the SpaceX service, including in often-underserved polar regions,\" the FCC order said. \"We conclude that the lower elevation angle of its earth station antennas and lower altitude of its satellites enables a better user experience by improving speeds and latency.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760553#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1760553&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f18b05780fad45f617f6c85e670b429cb2250fbb5e68dd1c5a218335b3ebea1e","category":"Tech"}
