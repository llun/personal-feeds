The standard Terraform Cloud setup requires that any resources managed by remote execution are accessible over public internet. With agents, you can also manage infrastructure in private environments without modifying your network perimeter to allow for public ingress. The agent runs within your environment and polls Terraform Cloud for workloads to execute. It is available as both a Docker container and standalone x86 binary.</p><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1618441596-tfc-manage-private-env.png\" /><p>In the <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-agents?in=terraform/cloud?utm_source=WEBSITE&amp;utm_medium=WEB_BLOG&amp;utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE\">new tutorial</a>, you will configure a containerized Terraform Cloud agent to run on your local machine and manage an Nginx container.
