Samsung had outsold Apple since the same quarter in 2016.</p>\n<p>Gartner estimates that Apple sold 79.94 million during the quarter, while Samsung managed to sell 62.17 million. Samsung did not release new flagship phones that quarter. Apple's sales were driven by the introduction of the new iPhone 12 lineup, which generally sold better than the previous year's iPhone updates. Apple sold 69.6 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>\n<p>However, this victory for Apple happened amid a general decline of the smartphone market. Overall smartphone sales declined 12.5 percent in 2020 and by 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744191#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744191&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3367ecbb3806c050abc29bbe4de01cd09742d40885112d510d66f88f035117b8","category":"Tech"}
