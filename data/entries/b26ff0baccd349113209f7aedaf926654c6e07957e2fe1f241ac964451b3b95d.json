Study: Far-Right Misinformation Is Facebook’s Most Engaging Political Content","link":"https://medium.com/@CybersecurityforDemocracy/far-right-news-sources-on-facebook-more-engaging-e04a01efae90","date":1615313858000,"content":"\n<p>Laura Edelson, Minh-Kha Nguyen, Ian Goldstein, Oana Goga, Tobias Lauinger, and Damon McCoy, in a bracing report for the Center for Cybersecurity at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Facebook has become a major way people find news and information\nin an increasingly politically polarized nation. We analyzed how\nusers interacted with different types of posts promoted as news in\nthe lead-up to and aftermath of the U.S. 2020 elections. We found\nthat politically extreme sources tend to generate more\ninteractions from users. In particular, content from sources rated\nas far-right by independent news rating services consistently\nreceived the highest engagement per follower of any partisan\ngroup. Additionally, frequent purveyors of far-right\nmisinformation had on average 65% more engagement per follower\nthan other far-right pages. We found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sources of news and information rated as far-right generate the\nhighest average number of interactions per follower with their\nposts, followed by sources from the far-left, and then news\nsources closer to the center of the political spectrum.</li>\n<li>Looking at the far-right, misinformation sources far outperform\nnon-misinformation sources. Far-right sources designated as\nspreaders of misinformation had an average of 426 interactions\nper thousand followers per week, while non-misinformation\nsources had an average of 259 weekly interactions per thousand\nfollowers. […]</li>\n<li>Center and left partisan categories incur a <em>misinformation\npenalty</em>, while right-leaning sources do not. Center sources of\nmisinformation, for example, performed about 70% worse than\ntheir non-misinformation counterparts. (Note: center sources of\nmisinformation tend to be sites presenting as health news that\nhave no obvious ideological orientation.)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s the basic story in a nut: It’s the not the same “on both sides”. The far right has a weakness for misinformation that the rest of the political spectrum does not.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not that Facebook’s leadership is pro-right-wing misinformation, but that they value engagement over all else. And if right-wing misinformation is catnip for a large audience, so be it. If it’s engaging, they push it.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/facebook-misinformation-far-right-politics\">Via Protocol</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘N.Y.U.
