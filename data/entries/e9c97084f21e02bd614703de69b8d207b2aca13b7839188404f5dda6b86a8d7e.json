In early October, however, YouTube mysteriously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/youtube-picture-in-picture-again/\">restored</a> PiP support for videos on its website.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThen, only days later, support once again vanished.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In the latest iOS 14.5 beta, Picture in Picture mode is working again on YouTube’s website, in not just Safari, but in every browser I have on my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ <a href=\"https://t.co/pP8cRsO3xU\">pic.twitter.com/pP8cRsO3xU</a></p>&mdash; Tim Hardwick (@waxeditorial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waxeditorial/status/1359460424370933765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's not clear what has caused YouTube website PiP support to be reinstated in the latest iOS 14.5 beta, but it's likely that changes in Apple's system-level code has broken whatever method YouTube implemented on its website to make the feature non-functional.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf that's the case, there's good reason to believe that YouTube will move to disable the support yet again. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYouTube's native app has never supported PiP for any of its users even though &zwnj;iOS 14&zwnj; has offered the capability for some time.
