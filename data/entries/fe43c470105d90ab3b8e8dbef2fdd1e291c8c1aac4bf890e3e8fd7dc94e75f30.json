To limit my contact with people I pretty much rode with the same small group all year and Bailey was in that group.</p>\n<p>We often discussed how staying local has been a big change. With Covid shutting down all events, I had no reason to travel. To be safe, and as a new resident of New Mexico, I just kept it to a 100-mile radius of our home and began scouring the map for places to see/fish/ride.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest takeaways for me is how a few close friends can make something as severe as an utterly shit pandemic more manageable. We both helped each other through some rough spots, spent nights under the stars, stoked each other out on rides, shot great photos, and most importantly, became really close friends.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s moments like this (still within the pandemic) that really make me value close friendship. Who helped you through 2020 and continues to in 2021?</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"fe43c470105d90ab3b8e8dbef2fdd1e291c8c1aac4bf890e3e8fd7dc94e75f30","category":"Cycling"}
