Zompetti postulated that the \"two unusual pads are exposed to the band,\" and may be a kind of iPad-like \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a>,\" much like those from various <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models, used to accommodate a \"Smart Band.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has filed a large number of patents around smart Apple Watch bands, indicating that it is something that the company has actively considered. Some patents showed how features such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/03/apple-watch-smart-bands-patents/\">biometric authentication, self-tightening, and LED progress indicators</a> could be integrated into a band, while others explained a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/01/patent-modular-smart-bands-for-apple-watch/\">modular approach</a> with batteries, displays, cameras, blood pressure sensors, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch's hidden diagnostic port was once <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/05/apple-watch-diagnostic-port/\">speculated to facilitate Smart Bands</a>. At the time, the diagnostic connector, which is purportedly based on the design of the Lightning connector, was said to be capable of supporting future accessories.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThird-party accessory makers were able to develop an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/04/reserve-strap-new-design/\">external battery band</a> that could charge the Apple Watch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/27/apple-watch-charging-through-diagnostic-port/\">through the diagnostic port</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/18/reserve-strap-suspends-shipments/\">changes to the Apple Watch's software</a> prevented the strap from ever coming to market. However, other smart bands not reliant on the diagnostic port <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/06/aura-smart-strap-apple-watch/\">have become available</a> in recent years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past, Zompetti has shared images of prototype versions of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/14/original-apple-watch-prototypes/\">original Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/29/apple-planned-ipad-with-two-ports/\">first-generation iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/27/prototype-third-gen-ipod-touch/\">third-generation iPod touch</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/iphone-12-pro-prototype-photos/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/apple-watch-prototype-may-show-smart-band-contacts/\">Apple Watch Series 3 Prototype May Show Contacts for Potential 'Smart Bands'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-3-prototype-may-show-contacts-for-potential-smart-bands.2302140/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=x2Y1uL2DQZg:hPXZUJinFGw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=x2Y1uL2DQZg:hPXZUJinFGw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/x2Y1uL2DQZg\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4e60495309b370bc03a12c88aef0575bb0bb64f36e2bdce19152ca7af71f797","category":"Apple"}
