{"title":"YouTube App No Longer Available on 3rd-Gen Apple TV, AirPlay Now Required to Watch Videos","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/youtube-app-pulled-third-gen-apple-tv/","date":1614803491000,"content":"As of today, YouTube has stopped supporting the YouTube app on third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> models, which means the YouTube channel is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/youtube-apple-tv-third-generation/\">no longer available</a> as a native option for watching YouTube on this &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; model.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/02/youtube-apple-tv.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"579\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-551789\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nNow that the app is defunct, third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; users will need to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> YouTube content from a compatible Apple device like an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> to watch YouTube on the big screen.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe app's removal is limited to the third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models. YouTube <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/04/20/youtube-older-apple-tv-discontinued/\">stopped supporting</a> the second-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models back in 2015. The fourth and fifth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models are not impacted as they have access to the tvOS <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and the tvOS YouTube app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nVarious app developers have slowly been phasing out support for the third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. In May 2020, HBO's apps <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/18/hbo-now-app-removed-older-apple-tvs/\">were removed</a>, and last week, the MLB app <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/mlb-app-removed-on-third-gen-apple-tv/\">was pulled</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThose who have a third-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; that are thinking of upgrading might want to hold off, as there is a refresh rumored to be coming later this year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; is expected to feature a faster processor and more storage space, plus there could be a new remote control and U1 chip integration to allow it to better interface with other Apple devices. There could also be a gaming focus, with Apple rumored to be working on hardware that would support console-level games.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/youtube-app-pulled-third-gen-apple-tv/\">YouTube App No Longer Available on 3rd-Gen Apple TV, AirPlay Now Required to Watch Videos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-app-no-longer-available-on-3rd-gen-apple-tv-airplay-now-required-to-watch-videos.2286946/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0nC1bGmm1m4:24-HHReVQg4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0nC1bGmm1m4:24-HHReVQg4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0nC1bGmm1m4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0cc1f5abf1798f751928f8b6e46c45ac3e8c368e95fefc761de8b2ef1933536","category":"Apple"}
