Disney announced the new MagicMobile service <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/disney-magicband-support-iphone-apple-watch/\">earlier this month</a>, which brings a contactless way to access many MagicBand features using only an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGuests can create a Disney MagicMobile pass through the My Disney Experience app and add it to the Wallet app. The user's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch can then be used at the same contactless access points as with a MagicBand. There is also the option to use a MagicBand alongside a MagicMobile mobile pass, so guests do not need to choose one over the other.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGuests are able to customize their MagicMobile pass by choosing from several Disney-themed designs that animate upon use, and users can also store multiple passes on a single device for families. With support for Express Mode on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch, guests also can use their Disney MagicMobile pass without needing to wake or unlock their Apple device.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nInitially, MagicMobile is exclusive to Apple devices only, but the service is expected to come to Android devices at a later date.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/30/disney-launches-magicband-iphone-and-apple-watch/\">Disney World Launches MagicBand for iPhone and Apple Watch With Animations and Express Mode Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-world-launches-magicband-for-iphone-and-apple-watch-with-animations-and-express-mode-support.2290085/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pr6mglOE5Uk:FJH0bk6jt24:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pr6mglOE5Uk:FJH0bk6jt24:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pr6mglOE5Uk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7362a61082de53dac510ea67344b62a4a44742a213d92e74d9171dbdf094c298","category":"Apple"}
