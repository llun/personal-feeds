We have good news: Amazon is selling <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3&amp;#038;tag=macworld05-20?tag=macworld05-20\">the M1 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage for $1,149</a>, good for $100 off the MSRP and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. You can also get the 256GB model for $50 off, but we recommend opting for more storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 MacBook Air is essentially unchanged from the model that launched earlier in 2020 with one exception: the processor. The MacBook Air is the first generation of laptops to use Apple silicon and it makes a gigantic difference over the Intel version. Multi-core performance is 2.3 times faster than the Intel-based Air, and battery life is about 50 percent longer. Plus you’re getting the new Magic keyboard, an excellent screen, and the thinnest design Apple makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re probably not going to have buyer’s remorse, even if the rumored 14-inch and 16-inch models arrive before the fall, especially when you walk away with $100 in your pocket.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>M1 MacBook Air, 512GB</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macbook-air-m1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t256GB, $999; 512GB, $1,249\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air&amp;subid1=1-1-343059-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">US$999 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f3a217370a1c5300f54117591efd3b8d0de8fb767595beeda9693783c68faa49","category":"Apple"}
