This one’s got all the beausage and quite the story, so read on below!</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00607.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I had a lengthy write up about this bike as a metaphor for my friendship with Cameron; there was an analogy to the brutally simple straight-forwardness of this bike as an all-arounder of a road bike and Cam’s stark frankness whether discussing bike building or set up or even just considering the state of affairs in our world. I suppose, like Cam, this bike is versatile like no other bike I’ve owned: it’s been my crit bike, a brief stint as a messenger machine, gravel bike when needed and even a few guest appearances as a cross bike at the local DFL series.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00611.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00601.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00618-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Cam built me this frame in the summer of 2012 as a replacement to an 85 Raleigh Prestige I loved riding. Turns out, the geo of Raleigh was more like my track bike than a typical road bike- 75-degrees parallel, and 57cm square. As much as I thought I wanted an exact copy of the Raleigh, Cam told me he’d build a frame I’d actually enjoy riding after 50 miles. Cut to me picking up a hunter green frame from his shop on Yosemite in Hunter’s Point. What tubing did you use, I asked him. He said, does it matter? Just ride the damn thing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00592.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00591.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There is something special about owning a Falconer. Sure you could describe them as just a steel tig frame, but Cameron’s frames are well thought out, devilishly frank, and capable beyond their description on paper. Cam’s bikes are almost the anti-thesis of a NAHBS bike in that there’s no fancy fanfare or glittering gimmicks. Hell, the frames are powder coated with vinyl decals- when you own a Falconer, you’re riding a bike not a paint job. That isn’t to say a fancy lugged bike doesn’t have a place in the stable, rather I should say you’d be surprised how much less really is more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/DSC00598.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If Cam hasn’t heard it enough, I do my best to say thanks for this bike every chance I get. It seems to get better with age, and I’m trying to keep up.</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
