As was the case last year, WWDC will be an online-only affair, but don't let that fool you: We think this is going to be an eventful keynote. Expect multiple interesting announcements for users living in or following Apple's ecosystem of hardware, software, and services.</p>\n<p>The focus of WWDC is almost always on Apple's software, and rightly so. This is an event primarily meant to engage with developers and encourage them to create new software experiences for Apple's various platforms.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we should, of course, expect detailed information about the new versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769720#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769720&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66a45c07f717b48dfba2b9eb3c696ac874dc069398791bf6c8fb4f7b49bc53dd","category":"Tech"}
