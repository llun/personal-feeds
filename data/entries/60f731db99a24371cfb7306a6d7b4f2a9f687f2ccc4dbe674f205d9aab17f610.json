{"title":"iOS 14.5 to Introduce Find My Support for Powerbeats Pro [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/powerbeats-pro-find-my-ios-14-support/","date":1614591434000,"content":"Beginning with iOS and iPadOS 14.5, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/\">Powerbeats Pro</a> users will be able to locate, track, and find their headphones with the built-in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/powerbeats_pro_jun_2020_feature2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-743889\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, formerly named &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, helps users locate and track devices linked to their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> accounts such as their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Mac, Apple Watch, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>. Thanks to Apple's purchase of Beats in 2014, products such as the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; have enjoyed deep integration with iOS and macOS. However, they have lacked support for the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith iOS and iPadOS 14.5, users will be able to locate and keep track of their Bluetooth earbuds right from within the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app. Currently, Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-sa/HT209590\">says</a> that if &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; are lost, customers should contact Apple Support, making the process of finding them lengthy.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLike &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, users will be able to trigger a sound to play from the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; to locate them. All in all, the new integration helps blur the line between the software experience for Apple's &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; line and the Beats brand.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\niOS and iPadOS 14.5, expected in the early spring, has quickly become the most significant update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> since its launch in September. Starting with the new update in conjunction with watchOS 7.5, users will be able to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch/\">unlock their iPhones with their Apple Watch</a>, even if they're wearing a mask.
