There's also wording preventing Apple from retaliating against developers who choose alternate distribution and payment methods.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple Chief Privacy Engineer Erik Neuenschwander spoke out against the bill, saying that it \"threatens to destroy the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> as you know it\" by requiring changes that would \"undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance\" of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNeuenschwander said that Apple \"works hard\" to keep bad apps from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, and North Dakota's bill would \"require us to let them in.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple does not allow apps to be installed on iOS devices outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and there are no alternate app store options that are available. Apple reviews every app that is made available for its customers to download, something that would not happen with a third-party app store option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple also does not let app developers accept payments through methods other than in-app purchase except in select situations, a policy that has led to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fortnite/\">legal fight</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; added an alternate payment method to Fortnite last year, leading the app to be banned from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBasecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who was also embroiled in a legal fight with Apple over email app \"HEY\" last year, testified in favor of SB 2333 and said that it gives him hope that \"tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">North Dakota&#39;s SB 2333 is the first real, concrete legislative proposal I&#39;ve seen that actually gives me hope that tech monopolies aren&#39;t going to rule the world forever.

Senator Jerry Klein said that there's \"still some mulling to be done\" in reference to the bill.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-privacy-chief-slams-north-dakota-bill/\">Apple Privacy Chief: North Dakota Bill &#039;Threatens to Destroy the iPhone as You Know It&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-privacy-chief-north-dakota-bill-threatens-to-destroy-the-iphone-as-you-know-it.2284180/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fdIxXICokBU:NvniyixgGYc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fdIxXICokBU:NvniyixgGYc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fdIxXICokBU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"adc70f4150a66f8662e18be7add0cfec46df751809dff635d24a4e3973c42dff","category":"Apple"}
