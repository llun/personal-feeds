Up until now, it wasn’t quite clear whether Tom Dumoulin might return to competition for this year’s Tour, but now we know that he will not. Jonas Vingegaard will be taking his spot on the Jumbo-Visma Tour squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for the latest from the world of cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dane Cash<br />News Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vingegaard replaces Dumoulin in the Jumbo-Visma Tour squad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When <strong>Jumbo-Visma</strong> announced its <strong>Tour de France</strong> lineup all the way back in January, <strong>Tom Dumoulin</strong> was expected to be a part of the squad. A day later, however, he announced that he would be taking a break from racing for an undefined amount of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still isn’t quite clear if and when Dumoulin might come back, and it was recently reported that he is on the list of Dutch athletes who could receive a COVID-19 vaccination ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, but it seems he won’t be at the Tour. On Monday, Jumbo-Visma announced that <strong>Jonas Vingegaard</strong> will race the Tour, taking the spot left vacant by Dumoulin’s absence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vingegaard has enjoyed a strong start to 2021, having won a stage at the UAE Tour and two stages and the overall at the Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali ahead of a runner-up ride at the Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pogacar reportedly considering racing the Tour of Slovenia instead of the Critérium du Dauphiné</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/Ciclismo/26-04-2021/pogacar-ora-meritato-riposo-il-no-delfinato-potrebbe-fare-giro-slovenia-prima-tour-410498334849.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a> reports that <strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> might not race the <strong>Critérium du Dauphiné</strong> as initially planned earlier this season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to La Gazzetta, Pogacar may race the <strong>Tour of Slovenia</strong> and the <strong>Slovenian national championships</strong> ahead of the <strong>Tour de France</strong> but not the Dauphiné. Should he indeed skip the Dauphiné, the race would likely be down two top Tour contenders who had previously been expected to attend; according to reports, Primoz Roglic is not planning to make the start either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>De la Cruz fractures rib in Liège-Bastogne-Liège crash</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UAE-Team Emirates</strong> announced on Sunday that <strong>David de la Cruz</strong> suffered a broken rib in a crash in the early goings of <strong>Liège-Bastogne-Liège</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 31-year-old Spaniard was slated to start the upcoming <strong>Tour de Romandie</strong>, but he will miss the six-day WorldTour event as he recovers from the injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ineos Grenadiers will host 10-hour Around the World fan ride</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Ineos Grenadiers</strong> announced on Monday that they will be celebrating the start of a three-year deal with <strong>Zwift</strong>, which will be the team’s “official virtual training community partner,” with a virtual fan ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Around the World fan ride will see 10 Ineos riders taking on 10 Zwift routes across 10 hours. Tao Geoghegan Hart will get things going at 10am BST on May 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Meme of the Day</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been at least a few days since we featured a meme poking fun at the UCI.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>New update on UCI priorities. <a href=\"https://t.co/WIvLEjrmfh\">pic.twitter.com/WIvLEjrmfh</a></p>\n<p>— Cycling out of context (@OutOfCycling) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OutOfCycling/status/1386601594410704897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it …</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Roval</strong> has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/roval-unveils-new-cheaper-and-still-tubeless-rapide-c38-wheelset/\" target=\"_blank\">updated</a> its popular <strong>C38</strong> wheels.</li><li>As Matt de Neef writes, <strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/41-and-flying-like-it-or-not-valverde-is-still-among-the-worlds-best/\" target=\"_blank\">just keeps showing</a> how good he is, even at age 41.</li><li>As Iain Treloar writes, <strong>Abdullah Zeinab</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/a-24-hour-world-record-attempt-falters-but-is-still-a-win/\" target=\"_blank\">raised over $27,000</a> for a Ugandan cycling club while attempting to break a 24-hour world record.</li><li><strong>CeramicSpeed</strong> has <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/want-to-back-ceramicspeeds-driven-shaft-drive-concept-now-you-can/\" target=\"_blank\">split off</a> “Driven Technologies Inc” as a standalone company.</li><li>A French acoustic duo <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/thibaut-pinots-doomed-giro-ditalia-campaign-has-a-theme-song/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a song</a> to show their support for <strong>Thibaut Pinot</strong> before he pulled out of the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong>.</li><li><strong>Tubolito’s</strong> new <strong>PSENS</strong> inner tube <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/tubolitos-new-psens-inner-tube-tells-you-how-much-air-is-in-your-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">tells you how much air is in your tires</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/tom-dumoulin-wont-race-the-tour-de-france-daily-news/\">Tom Dumoulin won’t race the Tour de France: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"abe8d0beb7a33c06fed4c87655d99c56a95232cf0b6971345d741d127cd55670","category":"Cycling"}
