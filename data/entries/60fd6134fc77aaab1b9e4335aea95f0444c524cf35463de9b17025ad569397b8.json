SpaceX said it needs that <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/54.201\">legal designation</a> in some of the states where it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/spacex-gets-886-million-from-fcc-to-subsidize-starlink-in-35-states/\">won government funding</a> to deploy broadband in unserved areas.

SpaceX should have capacity for several million customers in the US—the company has permission to deploy up to 1 million user terminals (i.e. satellite dishes) and is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/spacex-now-plans-for-5-million-starlink-customers-in-us-up-from-1-million/\">seeking FCC permission</a> to raise the maximum-deployment level to 5 million user terminals.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740130#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740130&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60fd6134fc77aaab1b9e4335aea95f0444c524cf35463de9b17025ad569397b8","category":"Tech"}
