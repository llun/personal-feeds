Welcome!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Here in New Mexico, you’re joining a growing cohort of companies that make up the backbone of the state’s fast-growing outdoor recreation economy. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham – through the <a href=\"https://www.governor.state.nm.us/press-releases/\">incredible public-health, social justice, and climate change policy</a> she has advanced since she took office in 2019 – has prioritized outdoor recreation efforts. The Governor views the outdoor industry sector as a key way for the state to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GrimpeurBros/status/1387222290576838665?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">diversify its economy away from reliance on fossil fuel extraction</a>.</p>\n<p>That’s why the Governor is investing in outdoor recreation businesses. The New Mexico Economic Development Department, led by Secretary Alicia J. Keyes, has many, many tools to support new and growing businesses, from infrastructure and job training grants to low-interest loans and help to navigate federal stimulus programs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/CajaDelRioFeb2021-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There are so many programs, in fact, that I won’t delve deep into all the acronyms or specifics here, other than to stress that there is financing (again, grants, loans, and more) available for a business like yours. I will also point you in the direction of two helpful resources to get you started: The <a href=\"https://gonm.biz/\">Economic Development Department</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nmoutside.com/\">New Mexico Outdoor Recreation Division’s</a> websites.</p>\n<p>Finally, I’ll leave it at this: If you own an outdoor recreation business and you want to move it to New Mexico, please reach out. We have financing and other resources to support you and your vision.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, please reach out. You can contact me with any questions at <a href=\"mailto:Alexandra.navas@state.nm.us\">Alexandra.navas@state.nm.us</a>. We’re here to help welcome you to the Land of Enchantment.</p>\n<p><em>Axie Navas is the director of New Mexico’s first <a href=\"https://www.nmoutside.com/\">Outdoor Recreation Division</a>, which is committed to sustainably growing the outdoor recreation economy in the state.</em></p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"8d3e17436ad10345cb2831af86e9ad64bdc46b9c94ba15141d6996d797cd6a56","category":"Cycling"}
