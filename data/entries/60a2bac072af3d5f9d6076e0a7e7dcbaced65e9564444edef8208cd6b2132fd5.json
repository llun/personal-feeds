Coming from a road racing background (and a one-time holder of the women’s Everesting world record), De Crescenzo took the lead with 55 miles (89 km) to go and eventually built up a 16-minute gap over second-place finisher (and 2019 winner) Amity Rockwell (follow the link to see <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/bikes-of-unbound-gravel-amity-rockwells-pinarello-grevil/\" target=\"_blank\">the bike Rockwell rode</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A member of the <a href=\"https://cinchelite.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cinch Elite cycling team</a>, De Crescenzo rode a Colnago G3-X gravel bike for the event. Below is her bike, photographed after spending 12:06:49 on the Kansas gravel course. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Released in 2019, the Colnago G3-X shares a number of features with Colnago’s V3-Rs and C64 road bikes. These include the use of Colnago’s own ThreadFit82.5 bottom bracket system and a headset that features an elastomer polymer cup in an effort to reduce front end vibration. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption><br /><br />De Crescenzo has previously competed at the road time trial world championships and so the clip-on aerobars are a somewhat expected sight. The extensions are the Zipp Vuka Evo fitted with SRAM  “Clics” eTap shifters at the end. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Number plates must be mounted to the front of the handlebars.

The wheels are offered with a choice of hubs, but De Crescenzo was rolling with the company’s own Cascade hub. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-7-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Maxxis Rambler tyres in a 40 mm width were De Crescenzo’s choice. These shallow-treaded tyres are a popular pick. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-6-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The Colnago G3-X has a quoted 700 x 42 mm maximum tyre clearance. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-8-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Where a number of De Crescenzo’s competitors used 1x drivetrains, the eventual winner chose a slightly more road-going 2x setup in the form of a full SRAM Force AXS eTap group.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-9-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>A SRAM/Quarq power meter and fairly large (for gravel) 48/35T chainrings.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-12-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>At the back is a 10-33T cassette.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-10-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Beep boop. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-14-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Arundel Dave-O cages. In our experience, these are one of the most secure cages on the market. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-13-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The G3-X uses Colnago’s own D-shaped aero seatpost with an integrated binder. It’s extremely similar to that found in the V3-Rs road bike. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-15-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Yet another Specialized Power saddle. It really is impressive to see just how many in the women’s field use the same saddle.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-17-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Matchy matchy Supacaz bartape.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-18-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Based on the frameset price (US$2,900 / AU$3,800), the G3-X is somewhat of a mid-tier carbon frame for Colnago. All the features are there, but it’s almost certainly using a lower-grade carbon layup compared to Colnago’s pro-level road frames. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lauren-De-Crescenzo-2021-Unbound-gravel-winning-Colnago-4-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The stem is Zipp’s entry-level Service Course model. The bike is by no means entry-level, but it’s also far from a price-no-object watt- and gram-counting machine that you’d expect to see first across the line.   </figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/bikes-of-unbound-gravel-lauren-de-crescenzos-race-winning-colnago-g3-x/\">Bikes of Unbound Gravel: Lauren De Crescenzo’s race-winning Colnago G3-X</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"60a2bac072af3d5f9d6076e0a7e7dcbaced65e9564444edef8208cd6b2132fd5","category":"Cycling"}
