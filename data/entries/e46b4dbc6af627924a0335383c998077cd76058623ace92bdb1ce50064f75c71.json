As a means of transport, a sport, or just for leisure, cycling has the potential to improve the lives of individuals, benefit communities, and lessen our impact on the planet.</p>\n<p>Making sure cycling delivers these positives while extracting a minimum of fresh resources, Rapha is changing the way it makes its clothing, starting by revisiting and revising its famous Classics line.</p>\n<p>'For a society facing up to climate change, cycling is much more than just a sport. Cycling offers a clean, efficient mode of transport to millions of people around the world, and we believe it has the potential to change many more lives still,' explains Duncan Coulter, Rapha’s Sustainability Manager.</p>\n<p>The first product Rapha produced, the original Classic Jersey redefined cycling style and set the tone for the following two decades. Expanded to form the Classics line, this foundational range has since had hundreds of hours of design time and development invested in it.</p>\n<p>Still among the brand’s best selling items, now the latest versions of the Classic Jersey and matching Classic Bib Shorts are being updated to ensure they sit as lightly on the environment as they do the rider.</p>\n<h3>Better clothing less impact</h3>\n<p>'The new Classic Jersey represents a drive to do things better,' says Emma Bentley, Rapha’s Fabric Development Manager. 'This garment is so prominent, and such an icon, that making this change demonstrates our commitment to reducing our environmental impact.'</p>\n<p>With the Classic Jersey mixing sustainable Merino wool and polyester, the synthetic part of this combination will now be sourced from recycled stock; reducing Rapha’s reliance on virgin resources and giving a second life to materials that would otherwise go to landfill. Global Recycled Standard certified, the recycled polyester yarn now used across both the Classic Jersey and Classic Bib Shorts can be traced back to post-consumer plastic bottles otherwise destined for landfill.</p>\n<p>Reprocessed into fabrics as high quality as the ones they replaced, performance and style are unaffected, meaning both items’ feel-good factor on the bike now comes at a reduced ecological cost.</p>\n<p>Of course, in terms of environmental impact, the best items of clothing are the ones you already own. With this in mind, Rapha has long run a free-of-charge repair service covering crash or accident damage. Keeping over 34,000 garments in use longer than they would otherwise have managed, next year Rapha will also offer a takeback or donation scheme for its products, while if you purchase a new item, you’ll now find carbon-neutral shipping as standard.</p>\n<h3>Small and large changes</h3>\n<p>With recycled materials now incorporated across its range, the overhaul of Rapha’s two most emblematic items is just the most obvious manifestation of a complete realignment in the way the firm approaches its environmental impact. Gestures without a plan can be well-meaning, but their impact will always be limited. Instead, Rapha is committing to a radical programme that will change every element of how it operates.</p>\n<p>'What might sound insignificant at first – swapping out a fabric on one jersey – has a domino effect for our environmental impact as a brand,' explains Coulter.</p>\n<p>To this end, next year Rapha will share its own net-zero target, and is committing to an interim goal of achieving carbon-neutral status in 2025. By that same year, the firm will have switched its worldwide network of Clubhouses and offices to entirely renewable energy, while aiming to produce more than 90% of its clothing using environmentally preferred materials.</p>\n<p>By that point, all Rapha’s durable water-repellency will also be provided via PFC-free treatments, while a year earlier all product and dispatch packaging will switch to responsibly sourced renewable or reclaimed materials that can be composted or recycled by the customer.</p>\n<p>Well before the end of the decade, it won’t just be the packaging that can be broken down or reused either. By 2027, more than half of all Rapha’s products will be compostable or recyclable at the end of their lifespan. Meaning clothing will either be reprocessed as the basis for fresh products or, if made from natural materials, left to biodegrade, both solutions will reduce the quantity of microplastics entering the environment.</p>\n<h3>Wear tested</h3>\n<p>Ensuring Rapha stays the course, it’s signed up to the Sustainable Apparel Coalition to monitor and improve its push towards greater sustainability. Of course, none of this will have the desired effect if Rapha doesn’t continue to make genre-defining products that cyclists are excited to use.</p>\n<p>Helping it create new products and improve those already in production is Rapha’s Wear Testing Program. A group of over 100 riders, they subject new items to everything from overnight adventures to relentless everyday riding, pro team training camps to ultra-endurance racing.</p>\n<p>Documenting every finding and opinion in a continuous feedback loop of voice memos, emails, and messages, they’re part of the reason Rapha is so confident in the products it makes. Now grown to cover the needs of commuters, bikepackers, and WorldTour racers, soon all will benefit from a design and construction that takes into account not just the needs of the rider but also the planet they ride on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5718770326&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Discover Rapha’s complete range</strong></em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/clothing\">Clothing</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"LauraB","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e46b4dbc6af627924a0335383c998077cd76058623ace92bdb1ce50064f75c71","category":"Cycling"}
