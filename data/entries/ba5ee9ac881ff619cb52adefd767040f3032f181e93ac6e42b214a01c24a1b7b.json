The company will levy a 30% cut on every\ndollar developers generate through Google Play beyond the first $1\nmillion in a year, it said.</p>\n\n<p>Citing its own estimates, Google said 99% of developers that sell\ngoods and services with Play will see a 50% reduction in fees, and\nthat 97% of apps globally do not sell digital goods or pay any\nservice fee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Google’s new rules are simpler than <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/18/app-store-small-business-program\">Apple’s Small Business Program</a>. With Apple’s, developers need to apply to the program, and if they go over $1 million in annual revenue, they no longer qualify for the discounted commission on any sales.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1371862837245665289\">Paul Haddad, on Twitter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’m happy to see more App Stores going down the 15% route but the\n“progressive taxation” nature of it just seems weird to me. It’s\nnot like the Store’s cost/unit go up as more units get sold. Just\ngo 15% across the board.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>70/30 percent just feels harder and harder for Apple and Google to defend. Make it 85/15 across the board and it all becomes simpler.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Google Play Store Drops Commissions to 15 Percent for First $1M in Revenue’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/16/google-play-15-percent\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ba5ee9ac881ff619cb52adefd767040f3032f181e93ac6e42b214a01c24a1b7b","category":"Tech"}
