This painstaking, function-by-function process creates raw programming code that can generate exactly the same binary file when compiled.</p>\n<p>With that code in hand, coders can examine what makes the game tick and make improvements and changes at a much more granular level than with traditional modding. In the case of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, those improvements include bug fixes, reduced load times, improved rendering, widescreen monitor support, and a free-floating camera system, to name a few examples. The source code can also be used to generate ports of the game to new platforms like <a href=\"https://nightly.link/GTAmodding/re3/workflows/build-cmake-conan/master/ubuntu-latest-gl3.zip\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/AGraber/re3-nx/\">Switch</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/re3\">PlayStation Vita</a> (though these recompiled versions all require the copyrighted art and music files extracted from the original game).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742654#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742654&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6881ad5beace9863c0ec13959965a420ae1bc76b7a2c56aed80698665456826b","category":"Tech"}
