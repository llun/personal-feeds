In my area here in New Mexico, there are a few, and just down the hill from Santa Fe in Albuquerque is <a href=\"https://www.buckhornbags.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buckhorn Bags</a>, a small company run by Sam Lutz. Sam makes custom framebags, both full and half, as well as a plethora of other accessory bags. I’ve got two bikes that have been begging for framebags, so when Sam announced he was going to start offering them, I sent him some money, a few photos, and waited for a few weeks. Well, I’ve been using these bags for a while now and would like to share the process and product with you so check out more below…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Custom Means Custom</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to hollering at Sam, I was using a “stock” geometry bag for my Sklar gravel bike. It worked for sure but the fit left a lot to be desired. For one, this frame has a curved top tube, and it’s a really long bike so not many off-the-shelf bags will fit it correctly. Having a completely custom bag for this bike just accentuates the things I love about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The process Sam deploys is used by other bag makers, so it’s not an entirely unique process. It relies on CAD measurements made from a simple drive-side photo with a ruler propped up against the bike to help in scaling the drawing. Buckhorn calls this process “Photofit” and you can read more about it at <a href=\"https://www.buckhornbags.com/photofit\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For this bike, getting that top tube arch correct adds another layer of complexity to this process but I was confident Sam would be able to nail the silhouette correctly. As you can see, he did! Yet the profile of the bag is only one part of the product.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>About 6-8 weeks later, Sam delivered my bags to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Half Frame Bag</strong></p>\n<p>Both the drive-side and non-drive-side has a full-length zipper. The drive-side pocket is deep and can hold a myriad of ride snacks, an extra water bottle, jacket, tools, or in my case, my Sony camera. The non-drive, or “map” pocket is thin, meant for things like your phone or wallet or a paper map if you carry one of those on rides. The map pocket has a long elastic net inside to keep your goods secure as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>What I like about Buckhorn Bags’ frame bags is how thin they are. In my experience, I haven’t gotten any thigh rub packing them out. The rigidity is due to how many lash points are on these bags. Even the half-frame bag has multiple attachment points, ranging from sewed-in straps to velcro lash straps, and on full-frame bags, you can choose to mount your bag on the bottle bosses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/BuckhornBags-35.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Full Frame Bag</strong></p>\n<p>These two bikes have needed frame bags for a long time. The Crust Dreamer is my tourer/commuter/grocery getter and the Sklar is my go-to gravel bike. Having a full-frame bag on the tourer makes total sense. I went with the “double-decker” option, as well as the “bolt-on”, map pocket, and X-Pac lining options on the full-frame bag, which Sam made from Coyote X-Pac fabric. It’s cavernous in storage capacity and I can’t wait to use it on tour once the temps drop a bit here.</p>\n<p>These custom framebags start at $170 and that price can climb with all the added extras. There’s a whole slew of colors and materials you can choose from, over at <a href=\"https://www.buckhornbags.com/materials-1\" target=\"_blank\">their website</a> too.</p>\n<p>Buckhorn bags also makes handlebar bags, stem caddy bags, and more bag designs are on the way…</p>\n<p>Got any questions?
