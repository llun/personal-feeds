Join the CyclingTips Fantasy competition</h2><p>\n</p><p>The Grand Tour of Grand Tours is almost upon us, which means it’s time for another CyclingTips Fantasy Competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re shaking up the scoring system to make for a better competition. The new system rewards you with points for picking a rider in the top 10 of each stage, and the points scale is the same on every stage. In other words, you’ll get as many points for picking a sprint stage winner as you will for picking a mountaintop finish winner. Meanwhile, if you miss your proverbial throw at the start list dartboard on a breakaway day, you’ll be in the same boat as if you picked the 11th fastest finisher in a bunch kick, instead of being a seemingly insurmountable five minutes down on GC.<br /><br />More on exactly how this works below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with previous editions, of course you can enter solo, but the real fun is in the <a href=\"https://fantasy.cyclingtips.com/Home/My-Competitions/Mini-Leagues?secID=823\">mini leagues</a> – so gather some cycling mates, join a mini league or create one and let the competition begin! There are some great prizes up for grabs, including Continental tyres, Rapha caps, Keep Cups, and for one lucky punter, the first edition of a very special new kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally we’ll be keeping you up to date daily throughout the competition with details on how the various category leaderboards are progressing, as well as plenty of tips from the CyclingTips team on the ground and from further afield.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more info or to sign up and play, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021-fantasy-competition-around-france/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
