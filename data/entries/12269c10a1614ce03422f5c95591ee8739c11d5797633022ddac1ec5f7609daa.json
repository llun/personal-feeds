In <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/houston-methodist-lawsuit-order-of-dismissal.pdf\">the five-page ruling</a> filed Saturday, Judge Hughes wrote that the lawsuit by the 117 employees—led by coronavirus-unit nurse Jennifer Bridges—contained false statements, misconstrued legal provisions, wrongly claimed coercion, and made otherwise invalid arguments.</p>\n<p>Houston Methodist Hospital system issued a mandate April 1 that all staff must be vaccinated against the pandemic coronavirus. Though the vast majority of the hospital system’s nearly 26,000 employees readily complied, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/hospital-suspends-178-healthcare-workers-for-failing-to-get-covid-vaccine/\">178 did not meet the June 7 deadline</a> and were suspended for two unpaid weeks. If they fail to get fully vaccinated in that window, they face termination.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773281#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773281&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12269c10a1614ce03422f5c95591ee8739c11d5797633022ddac1ec5f7609daa","category":"Tech"}
