In the Browse tab, which normally shows new and trending songs and playlists, Apple has posted a simple teaser telling subscribers to “Get ready—Music is about to change forever.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A series of rumors on Friday pointed to a Tuesday release for the new Apple Music+ service, which will reportedly arrive alongside 3rd-generation AirPods. The service will presumably allow users to stream at a bitrate higher than the current 256Kbps. Apple wouldn’t be the first to offer high-fidelity streaming. Tidal and other services already offer lossless streaming at a higher price, while Spotify has announced a new HiFi tier at a higher price. Apple Music+ will reportedly cost the same $10/month as the current plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Music app teaser is accompanied by a video of a spinning Apple Music logo but curiously doesn’t include any audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of Apple Music+ would be a surprise during the same week that the new 24-inch iMac and iPad Pro are beginning to ship. It’s also just three weeks until the WWDC keynote, usually a very quiet time for Apple releases.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d1f31f9718ab75db218feae2131d9ca9a59bdb5422502e81030c4041514d6c86","category":"Apple"}
