These features include Startup Boost, Sleeping Tabs, Vertical Tabs, and a more navigable History dialog. The company also announced some welcome interface tweaks to Bing—which Microsoft insists on categorizing as Edge features, but these items seem to apply equally to Bing in any browser so far.</p>\n<p>If you're not familiar with Microsoft Edge's release and <a href=\"https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download/\">download</a> system, there are three Insider channels (Canary, Dev, and Beta) that represent daily, weekly, and six-weekly updates in increasing order of stability. New features debut there before eventually making their way into Stable, where normal users will encounter them.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/release-and-beta-side-by-side-980x613.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          It's safe to install Edge Insider builds, even if you're an Edge Stable user—they exist side-by-side rather than one replacing the other.

Instead, you must either look for them in Windows Update or navigate to <code>edge://settings/help</code> in-browser and ask Edge to check for updates to itself. If you'd also like to check out the Edge Insider builds, you can do so safely—they won't replace your Edge Stable; they install side-by-side, with separate icons on your taskbar making them easy to distinguish.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747478#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747478&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"16d18f418bb65b8ae02c5eab3745173b3c4f109e6d38181324ff2949fa988efb","category":"Tech"}
