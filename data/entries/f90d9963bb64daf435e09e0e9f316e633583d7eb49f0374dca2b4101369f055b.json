That’s not the case. In-person collaboration <em>is</em> key to Apple’s culture (and success), and most Apple folks get that. And <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/apple-remote-work\">like I wrote a few weeks ago</a>, it’s not that Apple’s leadership isn’t listening or hasn’t learned much from the last 16 months — they have, and this hybrid model is the result. But the decision was made, so there’s nothing to “back down” from.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/30/obrien-in-person-work\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f90d9963bb64daf435e09e0e9f316e633583d7eb49f0374dca2b4101369f055b","category":"Tech"}
