The reading, which can be viewed as a PDF through the Health app on the paired <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, can detect if a user's heart is out of rhythm and possibly experiencing atrial fibrillation. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nECG on the Apple Watch most recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/apple-watch-ecg-australia-vietnam-next-week/\">launched in Australia and Vietnam</a> as part of the watchOS 7.4 update. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ecg/\">ECG</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/25/apple-watch-ecg-china-approval/\">Apple Watch ECG App Receives Approval in China, Already Working in watchOS 8 Beta 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ecg-app-receives-approval-in-china-already-working-in-watchos-8-beta-2.2302278/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rbMj0y6aD3w:O2qTg46Rb_Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rbMj0y6aD3w:O2qTg46Rb_Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rbMj0y6aD3w\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"500b4d8472f5bd6229ce1b663d5ed820ac2e67d8191f15f38394897513fe72c8","category":"Apple"}
