These new issues follow a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-card-outage-persists/\">widespread Apple Card outage earlier this month</a> that lasted several hours, impacting all ‌Apple Card‌ customers. The current issue facing some ‌Apple Card‌ customers is limited to in-store purchases, but online purchases seem to be working as normal. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Card‌ launched in 2019 as a tightly integrated financial service into Apple's products and services. Apple has partnered with Goldman Sachs to be the issuing bank for the card, meaning it's currently limited to just the United States. ‌Apple Card‌ features are integrated into the Wallet app with color-coded spending summaries, no fees, and up to three percent cashback on purchases, paid out daily.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> Apple's system status page now says that the issue is resolved and ‌Apple Card‌ is working as normal.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-card-issues-second-day-in-a-row/\">Some Apple Card Customers Unable to Make In-Store Purchases for Second Day in a Row [Resolved]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-apple-card-customers-unable-to-make-in-store-purchases-for-second-day-in-a-row-resolved.2301115/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LIycx7hkPyg:Ig2bQSPBblA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=LIycx7hkPyg:Ig2bQSPBblA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/LIycx7hkPyg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d8e1023712a34294d80481cabdf1c20d1d5f90eb7b4782c3273ee606f506e76","category":"Apple"}
