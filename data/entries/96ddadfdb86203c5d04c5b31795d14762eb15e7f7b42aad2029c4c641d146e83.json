But is it all too little too late? Only one mountain stage and one 30km time trial remain and Yates has to somehow find two minues and 49 seconds on Bernal.</p>\n<p>The good news is that Yates is not interested in finishing on the Giro podium, he is only interested in the pink jersey and therefore we can expect some exciting racing on the final weekend of this year's Giro.</p>\n<p>For now, the best images of Stage 19 from Chris Auld.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9682/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 15</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giroditalia2021-stage19-1.jpg?itok=VR5XQsCK\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>15</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9682/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery\">Giro d'Italia 2021 Stage 19 Gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>29 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9682%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2019%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9682%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2019%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9682%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2019%20Gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9682%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9682/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-19-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 15</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giroditalia2021-stage19-1.jpg?itok=VR5XQsCK\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"96ddadfdb86203c5d04c5b31795d14762eb15e7f7b42aad2029c4c641d146e83","category":"Cycling"}
