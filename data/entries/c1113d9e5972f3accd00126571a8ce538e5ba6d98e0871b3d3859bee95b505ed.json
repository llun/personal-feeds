How do you do that? Well, you better have a great foundation of a team, and a great foundation of core technologies that you can bring together in order to make a compelling series of products,\" he said. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPrior to leaving Apple, Lyon worked on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, input devices and sensor hardware, and finally, the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;. In 2016, he was working under Bob Mansfield, but &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; leadership <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/apple-car-join-giannandrea/\">has since shifted</a> to AI chief John Giannandrea. Prior to leaving Apple, Lyon was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/10/former-tesla-lead-engineer-returns-to-apple/\">reporting to Doug Field</a>, the former Tesla engineer serving as vice president on the project. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLyon has been on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; team since 2014, and according to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/apple-s-electric-car-team-loses-key-manager-who-oversaw-sensors\">Bloomberg</a></em>, weathered all of the changes in leadership until moving on to Astra this year. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/apple-car-benjamin-lyon-astra/\">Apple Car Sensor Manager Departs Company for Space Startup Astra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-sensor-manager-departs-company-for-space-startup-astra.2285094/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gdv7zwtYkwI:O4x3bjpQExA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gdv7zwtYkwI:O4x3bjpQExA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gdv7zwtYkwI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c1113d9e5972f3accd00126571a8ce538e5ba6d98e0871b3d3859bee95b505ed","category":"Apple"}
