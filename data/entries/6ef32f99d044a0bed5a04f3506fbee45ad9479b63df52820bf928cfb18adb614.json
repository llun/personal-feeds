Doing so in an economically and environmentally friendly way is simply the only option. Fueled in part by California Prop 68 funds provided through Sierra Nevada Conservancy’s Resilient Communities Grant Program, this project has the full support of local and state governments. </p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6ef32f99d044a0bed5a04f3506fbee45ad9479b63df52820bf928cfb18adb614","category":"Cycling"}
