With a 5,000 mAh capacity, the battery pack is capable of charging the iPhone 12 mini from 0% to 100%, the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro from 0% to around 95%, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max from 0% to 75%, according to Anker. The battery pack itself recharges via USB-C.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile the battery pack is compatible with the MagSafe system, it is not an official accessory, so charging is limited to 5W. Apple's rumored MagSafe battery pack would likely be able to charge an iPhone 12 model at up to 15W, in line with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/19/hands-on-magsafe-charger/\">MagSafe Charger</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAmazon is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Wireless-Portable-Anker-PowerCore/dp/B08TW7BRTJ/\">carrying the PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless Power Bank for &#36;39.99</a>, with orders placed now estimated for delivery in mid-April.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/anker-powercore-magsafe-battery-pack-side-profile.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"922\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785245\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nMacRumors contributor Steve Moser recently discovered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/everything-new-ios-14-5-beta-2/\">code-level references to a \"battery pack\" in the iOS 14.5 beta</a>, and this was followed by a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman claiming that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-working-on-magsafe-battery-iphone-12/\">working on a MagSafe battery pack for iPhone 12 models</a>. The report claimed that Apple has faced some issues with development of the accessory, however, so its release may be delayed or scrapped entirely.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, Zach Samson!)</em>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.
