With its blend of live action and animation, the original became one of the most iconic films of the 1990s. The sequel updates the basic concept for the virtual age to create what looks like a cross between <em>The LEGO Movie</em> (and <em>LEGO Movie 2</em>) and<em> Ready Player One,</em> with a dash of <em>TRON</em> for good measure.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for the original film below,)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Jam\"><em>Space Jam</em></a> is basically a fictional account of NBA superstar Michael Jordan's return to basketball in 1995 after retiring in 1993 to play baseball. (It was <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2016/11/15/space-jam-20th-anniversary-joe-pytka/\">inspired by</a> a couple of Nike commercials.) In the film, Jordan falls into the Looney Tunes animated world to help the so-called \"Tune Squad\"—all the most popular animated Looney Tunes characters—win a basketball game against a group of enslaved aliens called the Nerdlucks. In addition to Jordan, NBA players Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues also make cameos. (The aliens steal the latter five's talents to transform themselves into formidable opponents.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754311#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754311&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"418aaf5cc083e7f4103fe953f2b39e1fef55e07252871676e7afe55baeda3504","category":"Tech"}
