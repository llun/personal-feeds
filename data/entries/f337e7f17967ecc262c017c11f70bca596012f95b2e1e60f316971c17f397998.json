{"title":"A SuperDuper Workaround for Big Sur and M1 Macs","link":"https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/thats_big_sir_to_you/","date":1612399299000,"content":"\n<p>Dave Nanian, at Shirt Pocket:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It seems clear that the future of bootable backups is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>M1 Macs <em>can’t</em> be copied in a way that makes them bootable. Bare\nmetal recovery on an M1 Mac isn’t possible, since they depend on\nthe contents of their internal drive even when booting externally.\nAnd the tools required to make bootable copies of Intel Macs are\nlimited, often fail, and produce inscrutable and undocumented\ndiagnostics when they do.</p>\n\n<p>Everything’s a tradeoff, and with the M1 Macs, Apple has given us\nan amazing new platform, while taking away some of the things that\nmade macOS such a joy to work with. And one of those things is\nbootable backups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The workaround is pretty clever. Use an older version of SuperDuper that will copy just the Data partition of your M1 Mac’s boot volume — that’s everything you really need to be backed up. Then if you want to restore, do a fresh OS install on the internal boot drive and restore your data from the external drive where you cloned your Data partition.</p>\n\n<p>SuperDuper is one of my <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/superduper\">all-time favorite and most-trusted</a> Mac utilities. Big Sur is a big transition for a disk cloning utility; M1 Macs are an even bigger one. They’ll get it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘A SuperDuper Workaround for Big Sur and M1 Macs’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/03/superduper-big-sur\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f337e7f17967ecc262c017c11f70bca596012f95b2e1e60f316971c17f397998","category":"Tech"}
