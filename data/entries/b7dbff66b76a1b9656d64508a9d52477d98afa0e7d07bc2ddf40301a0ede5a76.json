Kuo had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-no-new-iphone-mini-in-2022/\">previously</a> stated that the iPhone 13, destined for this year, will be the last iPhone lineup to feature a 5.4-inch “mini” size. Kuo reaffirmed his belief today, stating that the 2022 iPhones will only feature a 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch size, with two models of each size.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe low-end 6.7-inch iPhone may cost less than $900 but could lack certain features such as an under the screen Touch ID sensor to compensate for costs. The current largest 6.7-inch iPhone, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, begins at $1,099.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nProviding some details about the camera improvements coming to the 2022 iPhones, Kuo says the high-end 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch iPhones will feature an improved wide-angle camera with 48 megapixels.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the same note, Kuo reiterated that in the first half of next year, Apple is still planning to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/2022-iphone-se-details/\">launch an updated iPhone SE</a> that will be the “cheapest 5G iPhone ever.” The update to the iPhone SE will feature a similar design as the current model, with improved performance.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/kuo-2022-iphones-under-screen-touch-id/\">Kuo: 2022 iPhones May Feature Under-Screen Touch ID</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2022-iphones-may-feature-under-screen-touch-id.2302017/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9pwZLCRQqaU:uGZIp5Fnb1A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9pwZLCRQqaU:uGZIp5Fnb1A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9pwZLCRQqaU\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b7dbff66b76a1b9656d64508a9d52477d98afa0e7d07bc2ddf40301a0ede5a76","category":"Apple"}
