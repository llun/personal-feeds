The 747 carrier aircraft then dropped the LauncherOne rocket, which proceeded to ignite, reorient itself upward, and blast into orbit. Eventually, the rocket deployed seven small satellites into an orbit about 500 km above the planet.</p>\n<p>This was Virgin Orbit's third launch in about 13 months. The rocket's first test flight failed in late May 2020, several seconds after ignition, due to a break in a liquid-oxygen line. But the second test flight this past January was successful, resulting in the deployment of 10 CubeSats for NASA. Now, the rocket has succeeded again. Suddenly, Virgin Orbit finds itself with a viable rocket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777259#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777259&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"06f5e1218af48822e95a6b3c2496ffc068d2151d3279855d5e54abc3d951a7ae","category":"Tech"}
