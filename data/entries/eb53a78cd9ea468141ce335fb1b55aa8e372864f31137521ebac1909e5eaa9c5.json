Developers can build and run end-to-end on Arm architecture from Docker Desktop on ‌M1‌ Macs to Arm-based cloud servers like AWS Graviton 2.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDocker Captain Ajeet Singh Raina said that the new software will \"let you do everything you've been able to do on a Mac already, and you'll be able to do it faster and with less noise.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDocker for Mac [<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>] can be downloaded <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">from the Docker website</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/15/docker-for-mac-apple-silicon/\">Docker Desktop for Mac Updated With Apple Silicon Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/docker-desktop-for-mac-updated-with-apple-silicon-support.2291808/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=U7_BOaERHqo:DYFLI9m6xLg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=U7_BOaERHqo:DYFLI9m6xLg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/U7_BOaERHqo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb53a78cd9ea468141ce335fb1b55aa8e372864f31137521ebac1909e5eaa9c5","category":"Apple"}
