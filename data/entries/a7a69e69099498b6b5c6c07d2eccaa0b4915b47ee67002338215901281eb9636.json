{"title":"Apple Continuing to Sell 21.5 and 27-inch Intel iMac Models Alongside New 24-Inch M1 iMac","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-selling-older-intel-imac-models/","date":1618943463000,"content":"Apple today announced the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> with a complete design overhaul and a range of new color options, but the company is still continuing to offer several older ‌iMac‌ models that use Intel chips as alternate purchase options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/27inch_iMac_update_feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIt should come as no surprise that the 27-inch ‌iMac‌ was not discontinued because it has not yet been replaced, with the 24-inch ‌iMac‌ instead replacing the lower-end 21.5-inch ‌iMac‌ options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is still selling all 27-inch ‌iMac‌ models at prices starting at $1,799. These iMacs are equipped with 10th-generation Intel processors and Radeon Pro GPUs. Apple is rumored to be working on an ‌iMac‌ that's larger than 27 inches, which we'll presumably see next year. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is perhaps more surprising that the low-end 21.5-inch ‌iMac‌ is still available for $1,099. This machine uses older 7th-generation Intel chips and Intel Iris Plus Graphics. Apple will presumably keep it around as a low cost option as it is $200 less than the new 24-inch ‌iMac‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 24-inch ‌iMac‌ model is not much bigger in size than the 21.5-inch version, but it is pricier, starting at $1,299. It will be available for pre-order on April 30, and will ship out in May.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-selling-older-intel-imac-models/\">Apple Continuing to Sell 21.5 and 27-inch Intel iMac Models Alongside New 24-Inch M1 iMac</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continuing-to-sell-21-5-and-27-inch-intel-imac-models-alongside-new-24-inch-m1-imac.2292372/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dzMknIIyaTw:ADFUuUIMsdE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dzMknIIyaTw:ADFUuUIMsdE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dzMknIIyaTw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a7a69e69099498b6b5c6c07d2eccaa0b4915b47ee67002338215901281eb9636","category":"Apple"}
