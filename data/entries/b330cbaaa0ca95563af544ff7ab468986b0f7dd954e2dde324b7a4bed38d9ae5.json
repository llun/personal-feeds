To test the theory. And over the last few\nweeks we built it into HEY, our new email service. We’re calling\nthe feature HEY World. This post you’re reading right now is the\nworld’s first HEY World post. And I published it by simply\nemailing this text directly to world@hey.com from my jason@hey.com\naccount. That was it.</p>\n\n<p>For now, this remains an experiment. I’ve got my own HEY World\nblog, and David has his. We’re going to play for a while. And, if\nthere’s demand, we’ll roll this out to anyone with a personal\n@hey.com account. It feels like Web 1.0 again in all the right\nways. And it’s about time.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of Web 1.0, HEY World pages are lighting fast. No\njavascript, no tracking, no junk. They’re a shoutout to simpler\ntimes. Respect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can subscribe to a Hey World blog via email (of course) or RSS. Feels like simple stuff — like RSS — is experiencing a renaissance.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘Hey, World!’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/23/hey-world\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b330cbaaa0ca95563af544ff7ab468986b0f7dd954e2dde324b7a4bed38d9ae5","category":"Tech"}
