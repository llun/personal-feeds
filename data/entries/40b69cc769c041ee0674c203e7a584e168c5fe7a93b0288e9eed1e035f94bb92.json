Most of those losses were due to attrition—including workers who were furloughed during the pandemic last year and then chose not to return to work. But Best Buy says that in recent weeks that it formally laid off 5,000 workers. The company now has about 102,000 workers—including employees in its retail stores and corporate headquarters.</p>\n<p>A company will often lay off workers because it is struggling. The last year has certainly been a challenging period for some brick-and-mortar businesses.

In the last quarter, same-store sales at Best Buy's brick and mortar stores were up 12 percent compared to a year earlier. Meanwhile, online sales were up an impressive 89 percent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745487#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745487&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
