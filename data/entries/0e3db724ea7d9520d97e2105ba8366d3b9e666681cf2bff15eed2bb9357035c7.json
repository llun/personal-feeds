After gaining remote access to a computer that controlled equipment inside the Oldsmar water treatment plant, the unknown intruder increased the amount of sodium hydroxide—a caustic chemical better known as lye—by a factor of 100. The tampering could have caused severe sickness or death had it not been for safeguards the city has in place.</p>\n<h2>Beware of lax security</h2>\n<p>According to an <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/service-details/cybersecurity-advisory-for-public-water-suppliers\">advisory</a> from the state of Massachusetts, employees with the Oldsmar facility used a computer running Windows 7 to remotely access plant controls known as a SCADA—short for “supervisory control and data acquisition”—system. What’s more, the computer had no firewall installed and used a password that was shared among employees for remotely logging in to city systems with the TeamViewer application.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741283#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741283&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e3db724ea7d9520d97e2105ba8366d3b9e666681cf2bff15eed2bb9357035c7","category":"Tech"}
