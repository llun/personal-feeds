Truth told, there aren&#8217;t a lot of options out there for coaster brakes, but luckily, distributor Merry Sales Company will be importing Eagle brand 2-speed coaster brake hubs in USA. They will distribute the hubs to dealers and distributors and will also conduct OEM sales and services. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of backstory from Merry Sales:</p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>International Cycle Gears of India has manufactured hubs and other parts for the last 25 years.   Mr. B.B. Lall, President of International Cycle Gears, has worked on the Eagle 2-speed coaster hub project for many years;  first with Mark Worksman, and later with The Merry Sales Co. Mr. Gurpeet Bhushan son of Mr. B.B. Lall will soon join the company after completing his MBA to handle this new project. There may be some people in the U.S. that do not recognize the name International Cycle Gears, but they have a long history of collaborating with Mark Worksman when he was President of Bendix USA. </em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Eagle 2-Speed Hubs are for sale at <a href=\"https://www.merrysales.com/shop/category/components-hubs-980\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Merry Sales for $119.99</a>.
