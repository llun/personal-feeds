His findings, verified for Forbes\nby two other independent researchers, reveal that on both Android\nand iOS versions of UC Browser, every website a user visits,\nregardless of whether they’re in incognito mode or not, is sent to\nservers owned by UCWeb. Cirlig said IP addresses - which could be\nused to get a user’s rough location down to the town or\nneighborhood of the user - were also being sent to\nAlibaba-controlled servers. Those servers were registered in China\nand carried the .cn Chinese domain name extension, but were hosted\nin the U.S. An ID number is also assigned to each user, meaning\ntheir activity across different websites could effectively be\nmonitored by the Chinese company, though it’s not currently clear\njust what Alibaba and its subsidiary are doing with the data.\n“This could easily fingerprint users and tie them back to their\nreal personas,” Cirlig <a href=\"https://hookgab.medium.com/ecff96fbcee4\">wrote in a blog post</a> handed to Forbes\nahead of publication on Tuesday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not what you want.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/01/ucweb-private-tabs-arent-private\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"450f9ab1bca47fc59ddf467fc0d5296deada6160666d5f41930a7ea17b8e03e1","category":"Tech"}
