Friends had warned her not to go: rumors had\nbeen circulating of an escalating crackdown on the indigenous\npeoples of Xinjiang — of Kazakh traders being disappeared at the\nborder. But Sabit had made an uneventful trip there less than a\nmonth earlier, and she wanted to be by her mother’s side. For two\nweeks, they met with family and visited ancestors’ graves. The\ntrip, she later recalled, “was full of tears and sadness.”</p>\n\n<p>On July 15th, Sabit and her mother drove to Ürümqi Diwopu\nInternational Airport, for a flight back to Kazakhstan. They\narrived in the middle of the night, and the building was nearly\nempty. At customs, an officer inspected her mother’s passport\nand cleared her to go. But when Sabit handed over her documents\nhe stopped, looked at her, and then took her passport into a\nback office.</p>\n\n<p>“Don’t worry,” Sabit assured her mother, explaining that the delay\nwas most likely another bureaucratic annoyance. Minutes later, the\nofficer returned with an Uyghur official, who told Sabit to sit on\na bench. “You cannot leave,” he said. “You can discuss between\nyourselves whether your mother will go or stay.”</p>\n\n<p>In an emotional torrent, Sabit’s mother pleaded for an\nexplanation. The officer replied, “We need to ask her a few\nquestions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She wasn’t released until early 2019. Brutal, heartbreaking, angering story, and the scope is unimaginable:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reporters with Radio Free Asia called up local Chinese officials,\nwho, accustomed to speaking with Party propagandists, were\nstrikingly candid. When one camp director was asked the name of\nhis facility, he confessed that he didn’t know, because it had\nbeen changed so often, but gamely ran outside to read the latest\nversion off a sign. A police officer admitted that his department\nwas instructed to detain forty per cent of the people in its\njurisdiction. In January, 2018, an official in Kashgar told the\nnews service that a hundred and twenty thousand Uyghurs had been\ndetained in his prefecture alone.</p>\n\n<p>The growing camp infrastructure attracted notice, too. Shawn\nZhang, a student in Canada, began using satellite data to map the\nfacilities. By the summer, it appeared that roughly ten per cent\nof Xinjiang’s Uyghur population was under confinement. Adrian\nZenz, an independent academic who has unearthed troves of\ngovernment documents on Chen’s crackdown, estimated that there\nwere as many as a million people in the camps — a statistic\nechoed by the United Nations and others. Not since the Holocaust\nhad a country’s minority population been so systematically\ndetained.</p>\n\n<p>As the crackdown evolved, hastily assembled facilities, like\nSabit’s in Kuytun, gave way to titanic new compounds in remote\nlocations. When forced to acknowledge them publicly, the\ngovernment described them as benign or indispensable — noting,\n“Xinjiang has been salvaged from the verge of massive turmoil.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are long block quotes, but they offer only a taste of the whole story. You’ve surely heard Joseph Stalin’s line that “One death is a tragedy, a million deaths are a statistic.” This is the first-hand story of <em>one</em> internment in China’s Xinjiang ethnic cleansing camps, and it is tragic.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/crackdown-in-xinjiang\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"16a0430368cc4b2f816a9c6141bdecf7886fb96b54e9476561a6b2fd01541f8c","category":"Tech"}
