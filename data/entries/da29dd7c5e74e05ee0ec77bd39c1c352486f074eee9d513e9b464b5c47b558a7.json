Tae-Keung went on to say that South Korea detected a 32 percent year-on-year increase in North Korean cyber-attack attempts.</p>\n<p>Pfizer has so far refused comment, leaving details vague on when the hack occurred or how successful it might have been. The newly reported hack attempts follow a spate of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54936886\">similar</a> state-sponsored attempts against health organizations that Microsoft reported in November 2020. According to Microsoft, those attempts were made by Russian group Fancy Bear, along with North Korean groups Zinc and Cerium.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742679#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742679&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da29dd7c5e74e05ee0ec77bd39c1c352486f074eee9d513e9b464b5c47b558a7","category":"Tech"}
