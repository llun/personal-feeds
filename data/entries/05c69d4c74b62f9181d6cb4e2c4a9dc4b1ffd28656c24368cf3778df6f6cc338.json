Users have to log in, dig through <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome\">the settings</a>, and tick the right boxes. Of the billions of Google accounts out there, the uptake on 2FA is probably not that high, and Google is tired of it.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, for \"World Password Day,\" Google <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/\">announced</a> a very bold move for account security. \"Soon,\" the company says, it will start \"automatically enrolling\" users in 2FA, provided their accounts are appropriately configured. Google doesn't go into detail about what \"appropriately configured\" means, but it sounds like anyone who <em>can</em> have 2FA enabled <em>will</em> have 2FA enabled soon. Google's preferred 2FA method is the \"<a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2017/07/better-experience-for-sms-2-step-verification.html\">Google Prompt</a>,\" a notification Google pushes to your phone when you're attempting to sign in. Rather than requiring you to type in a clunky code, the Google Prompt provides a simple \"yes/no\" check, making 2FA easier than ever.</p>\n<p>On Android, Google Prompt is a full-screen pop-up built into every device as part of Google Play Services, so that's easy. On iOS, Google Prompt requests for your account <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7026266?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;hl=en&amp;oco=0\">can be received</a> by the Google Search app, the Gmail app, or the dedicated Google Smart Lock app. It sounds like everyone meeting these requirements will soon be enrolled in 2FA.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763423#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763423&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05c69d4c74b62f9181d6cb4e2c4a9dc4b1ffd28656c24368cf3778df6f6cc338","category":"Tech"}
