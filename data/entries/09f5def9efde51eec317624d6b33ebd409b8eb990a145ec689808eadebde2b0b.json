The Great Divide Disc is intended to be their versatile, responsive road bike. It’ll fit 34mm road tires and still be zippy on smaller road tires.</p>\n<p>To add icing to this titanium cake, No 22 now has in-house Cerakote abilities with the intent of offering it as a production finish down the road, so this bike is a bit of an experiment in methods and finishes. Here, they used Storm-Trooper White Cerakote together with raw Ti and gold anodizing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Ritte-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Ritte-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Ritte-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ritte.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Ritte Bicycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rittecycles/\" target=\"_blank\">@RitteCycles</a></p>\n<p>Ritte’s new Satyr 2.0 titanium gravel bike that fits a 50mm tire and was made in a small, made in Portland, Oregon framesets. For the Builder Round Up they worked with Santa Barbara-based <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/goodcolorstudio/\" target=\"_blank\">Good Color Studio</a> to design this beautiful paintjob. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Speedvagen-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Speedvagen-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Speedvagen-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.speedvagen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Speedvagen</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/speedvagen/\" target=\"_blank\">@Speedvagen</a></p>\n<p>Speedvagen needs no introduction here on the Radavist.

Alliance’s hardtail with gold leafing logos just dropped the mic and walked away. What an amazing piece of frame finishing. Oh and this is a titanium bike too! No bragger’s triangle here. ;-)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-SaltAir-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-SaltAir-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-SaltAir-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.saltaircycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Salt Air Cycles</a> <a href=\"http://saltaircycles\" target=\"_blank\">@SaltAirCycles</a></p>\n<p>Salt Lake City’s Salt Air Cycles have quite the local following and rightfully so!
