Peltz, 38, is accused of working with over a\nhalf-dozen unnamed and unindicted co-conspirators to learn about\nimpending takeovers and other market-moving news, and to move\nmoney between accounts as a way to hide his role and profits.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/press-release/file/1379176/download\">The indictment</a> notes that Peltz’s moves were timed closely to\nstories that ran at “a financial news organization.” While the\nnewsroom isn’t named, federal officials cite five stories and\ntheir timestamps — all of which match precisely to pieces that\nran on Bloomberg News’ website. Each of those stories had shared\nbylines, but only one reporter is identified as an author for all\nof the articles: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-hammond-28b92b35/\">Ed Hammond</a>, who worked <a href=\"https://talkingbiznews.com/they-talk-biz-news/bloomberg-hires-fts-ma-reporter-hammond/\">at the Financial Times</a>\nbefore coming to Bloomberg more than six years ago to cover\nmergers and acquisitions.
