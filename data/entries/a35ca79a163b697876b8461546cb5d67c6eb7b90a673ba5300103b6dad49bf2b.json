If UHC decides the medical situation didn’t constitute an emergency, it will provide “no coverage or limited coverage,” depending on the member’s specific insurance plan.</p>\n<p>Emergency medical doctors and hospitals were quick to rebuke the plan. They say it sets a dangerous precedent of requiring patients to assess their own medical problems before seeking emergency care, which could end up delaying or preventing critical and even lifesaving treatment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772179#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772179&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a35ca79a163b697876b8461546cb5d67c6eb7b90a673ba5300103b6dad49bf2b","category":"Tech"}
