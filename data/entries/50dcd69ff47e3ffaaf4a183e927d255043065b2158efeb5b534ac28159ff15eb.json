The most common method is by receiving a normal <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> calendar invitation through their calendar app. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInteracting with the invitation, including declining, accepting, or choosing \"Maybe,\" lets the spammer know that the email is valid, so it can continue to be targeted.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther users are targeted through web pop-ups on potentially malicious or adult websites. Apple has not publicly commented on what specific measures it has taken to solve the issue, but through a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FgKO3Ed9-Bs\">video posted by Apple Support,</a> that has so far garnered more than 97,000 views, it has a solution. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe video advises that users, logically, unsubscribe from these spam calendars. The video doesn't offer any insight into what proactive measures users can take to not receive the invitations in the first place. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne measure that some users have found to be helpful is to redirect calendar invitations to their email, rather than an in-app calendar invitation. By redirecting invitations to their email, users can better manage and delete calendar invitations.
