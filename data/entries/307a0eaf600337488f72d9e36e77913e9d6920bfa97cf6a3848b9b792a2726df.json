The battle for the yellow jersey came down to Tadej Pogacar and Primoz Roglic in 2020. Although Jumbo Visma dominated the race with Wout Van Aert and Tom Dumoulin acting as super-domestiques, it was Tadej Pogacar who stole the yellow jersey with a breath-taking performance on La Planche des Belle Filles. We can look forward to the rematch this year.</p>\n<p>What about the Ineos Grenadiers? After 2019 champ Egan Bernal turned his head to the Giro d’Italia for the first time, Ineos must look elsewhere. Luckily for them, they have multiple Tour de France winners in their side and will be led by Geraint Thomas, who won the Tour de France three years ago. Thomas will start the race aged 35 but won the Tour de Romandie in dominant fashion this season despite slipping from his handlebars when sprinting for stage victory on the Thyon 2000. On paper, Thomas may be very slightly outmatched by Pogacar or Roglic individually, but Ineos have the greatest team depth. Richie Porte, Richard Carapaz and Tao Geoghegan Hart all finished on a Grand Tour podium last season and can step in or act as a second leader if Thomas runs into issues. When you also add Rohan Dennis and Michael Kwiatkowski to the mix, the Grenadiers possess exceptional squad depth that cannot be matched.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere we have a range of outsiders. Wilco Kelderman almost won the Giro last year but faded too early — he’ll lead Bora-Hansgrohe. Movistar have 41-year-old Alejandro Valverde, Miguel Angel Lopez and Enric Mas, Mas performed respectably last year, finishing 5th overall, Lopez will always lose time in the time-trials and Valverde, well, he’s 41. When it comes to Nairo Quintana and Arkea-Samsic, he lacks the support in the mountains he’d like and again, would need to make up a huge chunk of time in the mountains to be safe in the time-trial.</p>\n<p>The battle for yellow comes down to the Slovenians and, after showing he's even stronger this season, Tadej Pogacar is our favourite to win the yellow jersey in 2021.</p>\n<h4><strong>Polka-Dot Jersey / King of the Mountains Classification</strong></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AB2_7764_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621104756\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image credit: Alex Broadway/ASO/SWpix</em></p>\n<p>The king of the mountains jersey is awarded to the rider that accumulates the most points across the various mountain peaks. The jersey is often won by the winner of the race — believe it or not, being good at climbing mountains helps win the Tour de France. Tadej Pogacar won the jersey to add to yellow last season, and Egan Bernal was second in the KOM competition two years ago just behind Romain Bardet. Julian Alaphilippe, Warren Barguil and Rafal Majka are other recent winners.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogacar has only improved this season and is one of, if not the best climber in the world. He is our pick to win the polka-dot jersey for the second year in a row, a feat that hasn't been achieved since Rafal Majka won in 2014 and 2015.</p>\n<h4><strong>Green Jersey / Points Classification</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW1_5685_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621104629\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em>Image credit: Alex Whitehead/SWpix</em></p>\n<p>How has this jersey not been renamed after Peter Sagan yet? The Slovak won the green jersey on seven occasions between 2012 and 2019. However, he was beaten to the post last season by Sam Bennett. Sagan will be back with vengeance, he doesn’t have the pure sprinting ability to match the best on a flat finish but his climbing skills will help him accumulate points where others can’t.</p>\n<p>Talking of accumulating points where other can’t, how about Wout Van Aert? The Belgian superstar won two stages last season but was denied the chance to fight for green as he was strictly on domestique duty. If he’s given the green light (pun intended) this year, he is the favourite.</p>\n<p>Not far behind, however, is Mathieu van der Poel. The Dutchman is riding his first Tour de France so we can’t be certain how he’ll respond to riding a three-week race. However, we know that the Dutchman will attack from the get-go which, even if done unintentionally, will help him accumulate green jersey points throughout. Jasper Philipsen will probably lead Alpecin-Fenix in the pure sprint stages though which works against the Dutchman.</p>\n<p>Wout Van Aert is our pick to claim the green jersey.</p>\n<h4><strong>White Jersey / Young Rider Classification</strong></h4>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/AW1_5721_1024x1024.jpg?v=1621104792\" /></strong></p>\n<p><em>Image credit: Alex Whitehead/SWpix</em></p>\n<p>This happens to be fairly simple. Yet another jersey won by Tadej Pogacar in 2020, the young Slovenian looks almost unbeatable in this competition. Without the presence of Remco Evenepoel or Egan Bernal, the only two riders under the age of 25 who could realistically defeat Pogacar, he has the jersey all but sewn up even before the grand départs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The Tour de France 2021 Route</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/TDF21_VISUEL-CARTE_30x40_AVEC_HABILLAGE-A.S.O._1024x1024.jpg?v=1605631979\" /></p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 1 (<span>Brest &gt; Landerneau</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage1_1024x1024.png?v=1615223983\" />The Tour de France 2021 gets underway in France's North-Western corner of Brest. Riders will perhaps be more used to a flat stage or prologue to kick-off the festivities, but this year's route begins with a difficult stage that could suit a multitude of riders. The final kilometres are uphill which means we could see a puncher move into the coveted yellow jersey.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 2 (<span>Perros-Guirec </span><span>&gt; Mûr-de-Bretagne Guerlédan</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage2_1024x1024.png?v=1615224020\" />The second stage features less overall climbing metres than stage one (2000m compared to 2600m) but finishes on the Mûr-de-Bretagne. The climb is just 2km but averages 7% with steeper pitches. This one is for the pure punchers and Julian Alaphilippe will undoubtedly have his eyes on the maillot jaune.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 3 (<span>Lorient</span><span> </span><span>&gt; Pontivy</span>)</h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage3_1024x1024.png?v=1615224034\" /></div>\n<div>\n<p>Stage 3 is intriguing as it could go in a multitude of directions. The sprinters still wait for a pure sprinting day, but the stronger sprinters could well target this stage. The rolling terrain could make it difficult to control, but will a breakaway be treated to a stage so early in the Tour?</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 4 (<span>Redon </span><span>&gt; Fougères</span>)</h4>\n</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage4_e8653c63-84aa-4191-9745-d5b5b14305bf_1024x1024.png?v=1615224055\" /></div>\n<p>Stage 4 to Fougères is far from pancake flat but will be targeted by the sprinter’s teams. Should they have not stolen any previous opportunities, the quick men will have their first chance to dance at this year's Tour de France.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 5: ITT (<span>Changé </span><span>&gt; Laval Espace Mayenne</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage5_7c1d0479-c4bd-4d13-9d24-f7507f9a88b0_1024x1024.png?v=1615224077\" />Perhaps the GC favourites will have had a day off on stage four, but they will need all their energy here. At 27km, we could witness some early time gaps form among the GC favourites. With a flatter stage to follow, the sprinters will switch on cruise control.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 6 (<span>Tours &gt; Châteauroux</span>)</h4>\n<p><br /><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage6_1024x1024.png?v=1615224122\" />With fewer than 1000m to climb across the day, this is the flattest stage thus far. Another for the sprinters to target.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 7<span> </span>(<span>Vierzon </span><span>&gt; Le Creusot</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage7_1024x1024.png?v=1615224156\" />The most challenging stage of the race to this point. The peloton must be prepared for a long day in the saddle with 248km to cover. The first part of the stage is mostly flat, but the Côte de la Croix de la Libération (2.5km @ 7.3%), Signal d'Uchon (5.7km @ 5.6%) and the Côte de Montcenis (2.5km @ 5.1%) will cause mayhem to ensue. Perhaps this could be a day for the breakaway. Since it's such a long day, Stage 7 could be difficult for the peloton to control. We may even see GC contenders try to steal some time too.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 8 (<span>Oyonnax</span><span> </span><span>&gt; Le Grand-Bornand</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage8_1024x1024.png?v=1615224178\" />At this stage, we could have a well shaken battle for the yellow jersey, with some contenders gaining and losing large amounts of time. That is without any <em>real</em> mountains, until now. The Col de Romme (9.1km @ 8.9%) and the Col de la Colombiere (7.4km @ 8.5%) are the longest climbs in the race so far and are excruciatingly steep. A 15km descent to Le Grand-Bornand follows the final peak of the day.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 9 (<span>Cluses </span><span>&gt; Tignes</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage9_eea883b5-4c85-4699-8024-41d21ebbd1c2_1024x1024.png?v=1615224203\" />A monster. The Monteé de Tignes is demanding even for the most capable climbers in the world. 20.9km and an average gradient of 5.6% will decimate the peloton. It is too early for the Tour to be won at this stage, but it could definitely be lost here. The first rest day will be very much required after this...</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 10 (<span>Albertville </span><span>&gt; Valence</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage10_1024x1024.png?v=1615224858\" />A good chance for the sprinters follows the first rest day. They will have to climb for that chance, though the majority of the uphill roads take place earlier on so we can expect a mass-sprint here.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 11 (<span>Sorgues </span><span>&gt; Malaucène</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage11_1024x1024.png?v=1615224883\" />Two ascents of Mount Ventoux for the first time in Tour de France history. A descent to the line in Malaucène means those who are brave enough to attack must be competent descenders. Over 4600 vertical metres and 200km of road mean a long-day in the saddle, too.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 12 (<span>Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux </span><span>&gt; Nîmes</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage12_8c086708-487b-4e1b-ac06-ab1c368ca9a5_1024x1024.png?v=1615224899\" />A rolling day which the breakaway specialists could target. 2000 metres of climbing could make it difficult for some of the pure sprinters to get to the line at the head of the race, which in parallel makes it an even more enticing opportunity for those able to cope with the climbing.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 13 (<span>Nîmes </span><span>&gt; Carcassonne</span>)</h4>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage13_1024x1024.png?v=1615224919\" /></div>\n<p>Another rolling day where we could see either the breakaway or a reduced bunch sprint decide victory. The GC battle takes a breather before the final week.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 14 (<span>Carcassonne </span><span>&gt; Quillan</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage14_7d03cd77-4d1f-44f4-9a12-f20a65820a05_1024x1024.png?v=1615224944\" />An interesting day which won't be the first to be highlighted by the GC contenders, but could well play its role in the battle for yellow. The final climb is the Col de Saint-Louis (5.1km @ 6.8%), but over 15km of descending to the finish line could deter any attacks from the main GC protagonists.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 15 (<span>Céret </span><span>&gt; Andorra la Vella</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage15_1024x1024.png?v=1615224963\" />The race has now completed its transition to the Pyrenees, and, in case the riders had forgotten, 4500 metres of climbing will certainly be enough to remind them. The theme of few mountain-top finishes continues, though, with a 14km descent following the Col de Beixalis. The peak of this climb also has a time bonification, where the first three riders will receive time bonuses, incentivising the GC contenders to attack.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 16 (<span>El Pas de la Casa</span><span> </span><span>&gt; Saint-Gaudens</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage16_270b5268-9e9e-4358-9f1f-35f9c1d23488_1024x1024.png?v=1615224982\" />The battle of the Pyrenees goes on, but this could be a 'day off' for the GC favourites. The Col de Port and the Col de la Core are punishing — both are over 14km — but are too far from the line to see any significant attacks in the GC. A chance for the breakaway, perhaps...</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 17 (<span>Muret </span><span>&gt; Col du Portet</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage17_1024x1024.png?v=1615225029\" />A mountain-top finish! They are few and far between at this year's Tour, but the final climbs on stage 17 will be crucial. The Col de Peyresourde and the Col d'Azet will play the role of sapping the legs. The real show will be on the Col de Portet, a climb synonymous with the Tour de France. The final 16.3km at 8.6% gradient will definitively show who is feeling the best.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 18 (<span>Pau </span><span>&gt; Luz Ardiden</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage18_1024x1024.png?v=1615225055\" />The final mountain-top finish of the 2021 Tour de France. The Col du Tourmalet, where Thibaut Pinot won in 2019, will be the prelude on this occasion. That is followed by the Luz Ardiden which isn't quite as long at 13.4km. The climbers will desperately look to gain time in the GC with a lengthy time-trial still looming.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 19 (<span>Mourenx </span><span>&gt; Libourne</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage19_1024x1024.png?v=1615225076\" />The remaining sprinters have their penultimate chance here with a flat stage to Libourne. For the GC men, the legs will be truly exhausted following the Pyrenees, they'll sit up and conserve ahead of their final effort tomorrow.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 20: ITT (<span>Libourne </span><span>&gt; Saint-Émilion</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage20_ac042b73-ca43-413c-9000-419b9576e884_1024x1024.png?v=1615225092\" />This is it. The final chance for the general classification riders to make their move, though they will have to do it on the time-trial bike. 31km is enough to create some major time gaps. We will know who will win the 2021 Tour de France at the finish in Saint- Émilion.</p>\n<h4>Tour de France 2021 - Stage 21 (<span>Chatou </span><span>&gt; Paris Champs-Élysées</span>)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/stage21_1024x1024.png?v=1615225118\" /></p>\n<p>The most prestigious sprint in cycling. The winner on <span>Champs-Élysées </span>secures their place in cycling folklore.</p>\n<p><em>Stage profiles via La Flamme Rouge</em></p>\n<h4><strong></strong></h4>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Miles Baker-Clarke","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"307a0eaf600337488f72d9e36e77913e9d6920bfa97cf6a3848b9b792a2726df","category":"Cycling"}
