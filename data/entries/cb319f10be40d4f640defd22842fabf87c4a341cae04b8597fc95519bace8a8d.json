As <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/101467808.nlm.nih.gov/page/n23/mode/2up?view=theater\">Warren later recounted</a>, this was a person, and “being unwilling to disturb” him further, he stopped there.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to last October, when the press was on hand as Egyptian archaeologists opened the first of a cache of 59 recently discovered mummies for the whole world to see, revealing a perfectly wrapped body. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvTGv4IRlYg&amp;ab_channel=CBSNews\">Video</a> of the event went viral, and the Twitter pushback followed: “Even in death POC can’t escape the prying and opportunistic advances of white people,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tajmerk/status/1313170081015369729\">wrote one user</a>, in a tweet that gained nearly a quarter-million likes.</p>\n<p>The question of whether it is unseemly, ghoulish, disrespectful, or even racist to display ancient corpses, or whether it's a noble contribution to science and education, has nagged mummy displays since Warren took up his scalpel nearly 200 years ago. And the Black Lives Matter movement’s focus on issues of cultural ownership and appropriation has only added fuel to a persistent ethical dilemma for museums and experts who study mummies.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778201#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778201&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb319f10be40d4f640defd22842fabf87c4a341cae04b8597fc95519bace8a8d","category":"Tech"}
