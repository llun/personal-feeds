Early occupants of the hot seat included <strong>Edoardo Affini</strong>, <strong>Sebastian Langeveld</strong>, and <strong>Michael Hepburn</strong> before <strong>Alberto Bettiol</strong> took over the provisional lead with a time of 11:24. <strong>Stefan Küng</strong>, however, would power through the course to set the fastest times at both the intermediate time check and the finish. The attention turned to pre-race favorite <strong>Filippo Ganna</strong> after Küng finished his ride, but the world time trial champ was just a bit slower at the first intermediate and ultimately came up five seconds short of besting Küng, who then spent more than an hour in the hot seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert, however, would not be denied on the short, fast course. The penultimate rider on the road, Van Aert started the day 1:15 back on Pogacar in the GC battle. Recovering that much time would be far too tall an order, but the Belgian time trial champ did put in a stellar performance to top Küng&#8217;s time by six seconds and take the stage win, his second of the race after he sprinted to victory in the opening stage. Pogacar finished a strong fourth on the day to wrap up the victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reigning Tour de France champ stood atop the final standings with a margin of 1:03 to runner-up Van Aert, with <strong>Mikel Landa</strong> holding off <strong>Egan Bernal</strong> to nab the final podium spot, 3:57 down on Pogacar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, stage 7</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 VAN AERT Wout (Team Jumbo-Visma) 0:11:06<br>2 KÜNG Stefan (Groupama &#8211; FDJ) 0:06<br>3 GANNA Filippo (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:11<br>4 POGACAR Tadej (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:12<br>5 THOMAS Benjamin (Groupama &#8211; FDJ) 0:16<br>6 BETTIOL Alberto (EF Education &#8211; Nippo) 0:18<br>7 ALMEIDA João (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:24<br>8 ASGREEN Kasper (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:26<br>9 HEPBURN Michael (Team BikeExchange) 0:27<br>10 LUDVIGSSON Tobias (Groupama &#8211; FDJ) 0:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 POGACAR Tadej (UAE-Team Emirates) 26:36:17<br>2 VAN AERT Wout (Team Jumbo-Visma) 1:03<br>3 LANDA Mikel (Bahrain &#8211; Victorious) 3:57<br>4 BERNAL Egan (INEOS Grenadiers) 4:13<br>5 FABBRO Matteo (BORA &#8211; hansgrohe) 4:37<br>6 ALMEIDA João (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 4:54<br>7 WELLENS Tim (Lotto Soudal) 5:00<br>8 BARDET Romain (Team DSM) 5:50<br>9 NIBALI Vincenzo (Trek &#8211; Segafredo) 6:30<br>10 YATES Simon (Team BikeExchange) 7:45</p>\n\n\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sV_swVXyxJU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n\n\n<h3>Pinot is still dealing with back pain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme-sur-route/Article/Malgre-ses-problemes-de-dos-sur-le-tirreno-thibaut-pinot-groupama-fdj-garde-le-moral/1232921\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">L&#8217;Equipe</a> reports, <strong>Thibaut Pinot</strong> is continuing to experience back issues.
