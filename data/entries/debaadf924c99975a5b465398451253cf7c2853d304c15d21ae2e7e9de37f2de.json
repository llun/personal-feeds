{"title":"New Images Show Smaller iPhone 13 Notch Compared to iPhone 12","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/18/iphone-13-reduced-notch-iphone-12-compared/","date":1618727894000,"content":"Leaker known as \"DuanRui\" has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1383444354866372615?s=20\">shared more images</a> that could give us our best look yet at Apple's redesigned notch for the iPhone 13. The new pictures follow similar images shared by the leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-sample-smaller-notch/\">last week</a>, but the latest shots include a comparison with the existing iPhone 12 notch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/duan-rui-iphone-12-13-notch.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDuanRui posted three images on Twitter that apparently originate from Weibo, although source details remain unclear. All include what appear to be \"film samples\" or screen protectors similar to those shown in the previous images, except here you can see a clear reduction in notch width compared to the iPhone 12.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe reduced width is enabled by the earpiece being integrated into the top bezel, above the TrueDepth camera and Face ID components, indicated by the space left in the middle. According to a report from Japanese site <em>Mac Otakara</em>, the ‌iPhone 13‌'s TrueDepth camera array is \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/iphone-13-thinner-notch/\">getting narrower</a>\" because the receiver at the top of the display will move to the edge of the case.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>DigiTimes</em> claimed in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/iphone-13-smaller-notch-pro-cameras-larger-cis/\">February</a> that the ‌iPhone 13‌ will feature a redesigned Face ID system that will allow for a smaller notch at the top of the screen. Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also said that the ‌iPhone 13‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">will have a smaller notch</a>, although he did not mention the earpiece being repositioned.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/04/iphone-13-pro-mockup-smaller-notch/\">previously leaked 3D-printed mockup</a> suggests that compared to the iPhone 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro will feature a notch that is 5.35mm in height, as opposed to 5.30mm, and 26.80mm in width, down from 34.83mm.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/duan-rui-iphone-12-13-notch-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe iPhone notch has gone unchanged since it debuted on the iPhone X in 2017, and Apple could take advantage of the redesign to include more on-screen details on either side of the notch, where cellular information and battery icon currently reside.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ rumors have suggested that the device will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/28/120hz-promotion-display-iphone-13/\">120Hz \"ProMotion\" displays</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/12/kuo-expects-iphone-13-mass-production-on-time/\">faster A15 chip</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/05/iphone-13-rumor-recap/\">larger batteries</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">more</a>.
