{"title":"Brave Search Now in Public Beta","link":"https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/","date":1624389005000,"content":"\n<p>Brave:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Brave Search is available in beta release globally on all Brave\nbrowsers (desktop, Android, and iOS) as one of the search options\nalongside other search engines, and will become the default search\nin the Brave browser later this year. It is also available from\nany other browser at <a href=\"https://search.brave.com/\">search.brave.com</a>. […]</p>\n\n<p>Brave Search is different from other search engines because it\nuses its own index and follows different principles:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Privacy: no tracking or profiling of users.</li>\n<li>User-first: the user comes first, not the advertising and data\nindustries.</li>\n<li>Independence: Brave has its own search index for answering\ncommon queries privately without reliance on other providers.</li>\n<li>Choice: soon, options for ad-free paid search and ad-supported\nsearch.</li>\n<li>Transparency: no secret methods or algorithms to bias results,\nand soon, <a href=\"https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf\">community-curated open ranking models</a> to ensure\ndiversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright\ncensorship.</li>\n<li>Seamlessness: best-in-class integration between the browser and\nsearch without compromising privacy, from personalization to\ninstant results as the user types.</li>\n<li>Openness: Brave Search will soon be available to power other\nsearch engines.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m interested to see how it compares to DuckDuckGo (my default for several years now) in daily driving.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/sneak-preview-of-brave-search-a-challenger-to-google/410680/\">Roger Montti at Search Engine Journal had good things to say about it last week</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Brave search is currently in testing mode. So it’s not fair to\nmake judgments on an unfinished product. That said, the quality of\nthe search results that I have seen are outstanding in terms of\nusefulness. […]</p>\n\n<p>There is a lack of clutter in Brave that sets it apart not only\nfrom Google but from Bing and DuckDuckGo. After using Brave, I\nsuspect that a reason why I have not embraced Bing, despite liking\nBing’s search results, is that Bing feels similar to Google.</p>\n\n<p>Brave on the other hand offers me something different that feels\njust right and makes me want to return to it, something I’ve never\nfelt using any other Google competitor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/22/brave-search-public-beta\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7a062929353280b02dde01ad3b0aa7262852ea2f068b5d3c72f68662638b6341","category":"Tech"}
