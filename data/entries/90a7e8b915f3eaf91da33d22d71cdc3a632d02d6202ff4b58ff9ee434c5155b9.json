{"title":"iPhone 13 Mini to Be Assembled By Pegatron and Foxconn [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/iphone-13-mini-assembled-by-pegatron/","date":1625548787000,"content":"Taiwanese Apple supplier Pegatron will remain a major assembler of smaller iPhones and will share orders for this year's forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> mini with Foxconn, claims a new report from <em>DigiTimes</em>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iPhone-mini-wonder-feature.jpg\" /><blockquote>Pegatron has obtained orders for the upcoming 5.4-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> model, as well as a portion of orders for another upcoming ‌iPhone‌ model that will feature a 6.1-inch display, according to market sources.</blockquote>This year's ‌iPhone 13‌ mini is expected to be the last 5.4-inch model that Apple will offer in its flagship lineup, owing to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/phone-13-mini-rumors/\">poor sales</a>, according to reliable sources. Apple does not plan to introduce a 5.4-inch ‌iPhone‌ 14 mini, with the mini line ending after the ‌iPhone 13‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-no-new-iphone-mini-in-2022/\">According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple in 2022 will instead offer two 6.1-inch iPhones and two 6.7-inch iPhones, so both the standard ‌iPhone‌ 14 and the ‌iPhone‌ 14 Pro will be available in those two size options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPegatron is Apple's second-largest ‌‌iPhone‌‌ assembler after Foxconn, and in February <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/pegatron-buys-land-iphone-assembly-india/\">spent</a> $14.2 million to buy land rights for building a factory in Chennai, India. The outlay followed a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/23/iphone-pegatron-150m-investment-india/\">proposal</a> approved in late 2020 by its board of directors to spend $150 million on building its first ‌‌iPhone‌‌ manufacturing plant in the country.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRegular readers may recall that Apple suspended its partnership with Pegatron in November 2020 after it discovered that the major ‌iPhone‌ supplier was committing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/09/apple-suspends-pegatron-labor-violations/\">labor violations</a> at a student workers' program.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple put Pegatron on probation as a result of the violations, and while supplier's current ‌‌iPhone‌‌ business was not expected to be affected, it was originally forecast to lose some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> orders to other Apple supplier Luxshare.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest information was shared in <em>DigiTimes</em>' paywalled \"Before Going to Press\" section, so there are no further details yet, but the full report should be released later on Tuesday.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<hr />\r\n<br />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> The full report, now released, reveals that both Pegatron and Foxconn will share orders for ‌iPhone 13‌ mini, although Pegatron has seen orders for the smaller form factor ‌iPhone‌ reduce significantly this year due to lower-than-expected sales of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Pegatron is also likely to land a small portion of the orders for the standard 6.1-inch ‌iPhone 13‌ model in the new ‌iPhone‌ lineup, Foxconn will remain the primary assembler for the entire 2021 ‌iPhone‌ series. China-based Luxshare will also become one of Apple's ‌iPhone‌ production partners this year, according to <em>DigiTimes</em>' sources.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pegatron/\">Pegatron</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/06/iphone-13-mini-assembled-by-pegatron/\">iPhone 13 Mini to Be Assembled By Pegatron and Foxconn [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-mini-to-be-assembled-by-pegatron-and-foxconn-updated.2303364/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=a14dKtGuVGM:06FPGDwagpY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=a14dKtGuVGM:06FPGDwagpY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/a14dKtGuVGM\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"90a7e8b915f3eaf91da33d22d71cdc3a632d02d6202ff4b58ff9ee434c5155b9","category":"Apple"}
