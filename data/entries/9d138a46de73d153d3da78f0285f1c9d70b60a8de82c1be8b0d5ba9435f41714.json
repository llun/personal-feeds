Significant new OS changes probably won't be discussed until the company's developer conference in June, and said updates probably won't reach the public until September or October.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744614#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744614&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9d138a46de73d153d3da78f0285f1c9d70b60a8de82c1be8b0d5ba9435f41714","category":"Tech"}
