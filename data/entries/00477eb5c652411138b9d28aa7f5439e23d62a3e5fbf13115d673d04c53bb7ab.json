That might not sound too impressive on the surface; it's only about a quarter-second under the world record <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb0nd19T4b0\">set by Miniland just two months ago</a>, after all, and less than a second under the first sub-4:56 time (4:55.913) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gum4GI2Jr0s\">set by Kosmic over two years ago</a>.</p>\n<p>But once you understand everything that needed to come together to break <em>SMB</em>'s 4:55 barrier, the feat becomes something akin to speedrunning's version of the four-minute mile. Niftski's performance is within spitting distance of the machine-generated perfection of <a href=\"http://tasvideos.org/1715M.html\"> tool-assisted speedruns</a>, which use emulator-recorded frame-perfect inputs to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/inside-tasbots-semi-secret-probably-legal-effort-to-control-the-nintendo-switch/\">push a game to its limits</a>. Niftski's performance approaches the theoretical limits of what a human can achieve in this seminal game.</p>\n<p>What goes into a feat like this?
