The company on Tuesday announced the availability of native versions of Illustrator, InDesign, and Lightroom Classic. Premiere’s Apple Silicon version is still in public beta and will be available soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They join already-available native versions of Photoshop, XD, and Lightroom, making all of the seven core Creative Cloud apps now optimized to run natively on M1 macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adobe also commissioned third-party performance benchmarks from The Pfeiffer Report. The benchmarks covered all seven of the core M1-native Creative Cloud apps and took 774 individual measurements on a range of workflows and activities. The two systems compared were configured as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple M1:</strong> 13 inch M1 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intel:</strong> 13 inch Intel Core i5 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As configured, the M1 system would cost $2,299 and the Intel system would cost $2,399.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the performance varied based on application and workflow, the overall performance improvement across all apps and tests is a whopping 83 percent. The app with the lowest performance advantage over the Intel-based MacBook Pro is InDesign, which averaged “only” 59 percent faster. The biggest performance boost is in Lightroom Classic, which at a 116-percent boost is more than twice as fast on the M1 MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chart from the report summarizes the performance boost in Creative Cloud apps, and highlights a couple of tests in each app that were remarkably faster on the M1 MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/benchmark-summary-adobe-m1.png?w=932\" /><figcaption>Third-party benchmarks show a huge benefit to Apple Silicon.</figcaption></figure><p>Adobe / Pfeiffer Report</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234330/apple-details-an-impressive-aggressive-transition-to-macs-with-apple-silicon.html\">transition to its own SoCs</a> is definitely paying dividends for creative professionals, and we’re not even halfway through the two-year transition process. </p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"837c2641f521c7ac28448e99d0f0fedaffadc748d8a27105c10a3a874b331428","category":"Apple"}
