Power was dropped with around 60 km to go, and then Pöstlberger and Shane Archbold surged off the front with a little over 30 km to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the peloton at around two and a half minutes back, Pöstlberger dropped Archbold on an uncategorized rise with around 20 km to go. His advantage began to fall as he made his way up the second-category penultimate climb of the day, but he still had nearly a minute left as he crested the ascent with just under 7 km to go. Ben O’Connor jumped from the pack as it went over the top of the climb and closed to within around 20 seconds as Pöstlberger made his way up the fourth-category final climb of the day, but Pöstlberger went up and over with a gap intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pack, led by Bahrain Victorious and Movistar, caught up to O’Connor on the descent to the finish, but Pöstlberger held on, taking the victory with an 11-second gap back to Sonny Colbrelli (Bahrain Victorious), who took runner-up honors for the second straight day with Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) in third.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Critérium du Dauphiné (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>Brioude  → Saugues</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=256063\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">PÖSTLBERGER Lukas</a>\n                                            <span>BORA -
