For example, users can bring a U1-equipped iPhone close to a HomePod mini to hand off music playback, complete with visual, audible, and haptic effects, or access a Precision Finding feature when an AirTag is near a U1-equipped iPhone.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNXP Semiconductors and Qorvo are now offering development kits for designing third-party accessories that are interoperable with the U1 chip. However, it's unclear when the first U1-enabled third-party accessories will be released.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple first opened up the U1 chip to app developers with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/23/u1-chip-nearby-interaction-framework/\">release of the Nearby Interaction framework</a> at WWDC 2020, allowing for precise, directionally aware app experiences, and now it is expanding this Ultra Wideband integration to hardware accessories.
