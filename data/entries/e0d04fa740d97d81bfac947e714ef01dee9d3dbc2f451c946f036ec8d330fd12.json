[credit:\n                        GMC                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>Last fall, after a long teaser campaign that included a high-profile Super Bowl commercial, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/american-excess-is-back-with-the-1000hp-2022-gmc-hummer-ev-truck/\">GMC unveiled its new Hummer EV truck</a>. Designed around General Motors' forthcoming <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/general-motors-announces-new-battery-platform-claims-100kwh-soon/\">800-volt Ultium batteries</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/this-family-of-electric-motors-will-drive-gms-new-electric-vehicles/\">Ultium Drive electric motors</a>, it will lead GM's renewed electrification efforts when the first Hummer EV Edition 1s reach customers early in 2022. Sometime the following year, the Hummer EV truck will be joined by a second bombastic electric go-anywhere machine—the Hummer EV SUV.</p>\n<p>Officially revealed online on Monday morning, the Hummer EV SUV is actually the smaller of the pair, 20 inches (507 mm) shorter overall with nine inches (227 mm) taken out of the wheelbase. GMC says that will make the Hummer EV SUV much more maneuverable than the truck on off-road trails and in the city, particularly if fitted with the optional four-wheel steering system that allows it to crab walk diagonally.</p>\n<p>However, chopping nine inches out of the wheelbase evidently means using fewer Ultium modules in the double-stacked battery pack. As with the Hummer EV truck, GMC isn't ready to quote an exact amount of kWh in the pack. But maximum power is only 830 hp (619 kW) from its three motors rather than the 1,000 hp (746 kW) available from the truck's 24-module pack, and similarly, GMC is only estimating 300 miles (482 km) of range as opposed to 350 miles (564 km) for the one with a load bed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754532#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754532&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
