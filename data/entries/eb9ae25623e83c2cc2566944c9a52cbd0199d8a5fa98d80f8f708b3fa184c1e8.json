From creator Alex Robb:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I created Newsstand as a fun way to access the news on my vintage\nMacs. I have a two Apple PowerBook G3 computers, but older\nmachines don’t work very well on the modern web. Their browsers\ncan’t load https websites, and vintage hardware can’t keep up with\nthe dynamic pages that make up the web today. I created Newsstand\nin Mac OS 9 using tools only available at the time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He even made the website on Mac OS 9.</p>\n\n<p>As a sidenote, this is the best new app icon I’ve seen in years. Newsstand’s exquisite 3D icon is a jarring reminder of just how boring today’s flat icon aesthetic is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/23/newsstand\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eb9ae25623e83c2cc2566944c9a52cbd0199d8a5fa98d80f8f708b3fa184c1e8","category":"Tech"}
