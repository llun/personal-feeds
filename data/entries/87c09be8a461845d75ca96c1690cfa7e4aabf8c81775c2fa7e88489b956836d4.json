After you introduce a\nnew feature, change a policy, or remove something, knee-jerk\nreactions, often negative, will pour in.</p>\n\n<p>Resist the urge to panic or rapidly change things in response.\nPassions flare in the beginning. But if you ride out this initial\n24-48 hour period, things will usually settle down. Most people\nrespond before they’ve really dug in and used whatever you’ve\nadded (or gotten along with what you’ve removed). So sit back,\ntake it all in, and don’t make a move until some time has passed.\nThen you’ll be able to offer a more reasoned response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good advice.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/27/ride-out-the-storm\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"87c09be8a461845d75ca96c1690cfa7e4aabf8c81775c2fa7e88489b956836d4","category":"Tech"}
