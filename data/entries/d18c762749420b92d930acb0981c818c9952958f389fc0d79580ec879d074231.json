It's just physics, he explained.</p>\n<p>As its Falcon 9 rocket has become more reliable and flown more frequently—18 launches so far this year, and counting—it seems that SpaceX has succeeded in taking the magic out of launches. And while reliability should definitely be the goal, such regularity does distract from the spectacle of watching a rocket launch.</p>\n\n<p>But there are still some special Falcon 9 missions, and that's certainly the case with a launch expected to occur at 12:09 pm ET (16:09 UTC) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. With the launch of a next-generation GPS III spacecraft, SpaceX will fly a national security mission for the first time on a reused booster.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774211#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d18c762749420b92d930acb0981c818c9952958f389fc0d79580ec879d074231","category":"Tech"}
