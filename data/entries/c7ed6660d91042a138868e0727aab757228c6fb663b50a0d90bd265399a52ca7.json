The road bike market, however, has proven the hardest to make inroads into.</p>\n<p>That's down to the fact that road bikes tend to be ridden purely for fitness (and fun) and as such are intrinsically light machines. As a result, e-road bikes have typically only found favour with those who enjoy cycling but physically need a helping hand at certain times.</p>\n<p>However the lighter e-road bikes get, the wider their customer base becomes.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9552/ribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images#13\"><p><span>Image 14 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/ribble_endurance_sl_e_hero_1.jpg?itok=1kQN_9zj\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 14 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Light, light baby</h3>\n<p>With that in mind, let's not beat around the bush: weight is the main talking point when it comes to Ribble's new offerings. You get more than a hint that these bikes are light just by looking at them – they certainly don't have the tell-tale bulk that gives the motorised game away on so many rival e-bikes. And that hint is borne out when you put them on the scales: the Endurance SL e Hero weighs in at a very tidy 10.5kg and the Endurance AL e comes in at 13kg.</p>\n<p>To achieve this low weight, both bikes make use of a fully integrated Mahle EBM X35 power system which claims to be faster, more efficient and – most importantly – lighter than its predecessors and is controlled via a button on the top tube.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9552/ribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/ribble_endurance_al_e_4.jpg?itok=EN8MnxjL\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>On the carbon monocoque SL e Hero you get a Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 Disc groupset as well as Level Superlight EBM carbon wheels and Level 5 carbon integrated handlebar system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-endurance-al-e/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Ribble Endurance AL e now</strong></em></a>  <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-endurance-sl-e-hero/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Ribble Endurance SL e Hero now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the AL e, built with 6061 T6 aluminium, comes with a Shimano 105 groupset by default – though you can upgrade that to Ultegra via Ribble's BikeBuilder function – alongside a Mavic Ksyrium S 25 wheelset, the ergonomic Level 2 handlebar system and a carbon seatpost.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full route details for this year's race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>But at what cost?</h3>\n<p>At the base level, the Ribble Endurance AL e will set you back £2,699 and the Ribble Endurance SL e Hero without the bells and whistles (but with the bell) will cost £6,999.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Ribble's fluid buying system, however, both bikes can be extensively tailored using its BikeBuilder to customise certain aspects to your liking. As you'd expect, this may bump up the price, and not everything is available to change. One addition we do like the sound of is adding an <a href=\"/in-depth/9541/wheels-of-fortune-oversize-pulley-wheel-systems\" target=\"_blank\">oversized pulley wheel</a> system to the SL e Hero for an extra £120.</p>\n<p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/bikes/electric-bikes/road-electric-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">ribblecycles.co.uk</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-endurance-al-e/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Ribble Endurance AL e now</strong></em></a>  <br />\n<a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-endurance-sl-e-hero/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Ribble Endurance SL e Hero now</strong></em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9552/ribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images\">Ribble Endurance ridiculously light e-bikes images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>28 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9552%2Fribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Ribble%20Endurance%20ridiculously%20light%20e-bikes%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9552%2Fribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Ribble%20Endurance%20ridiculously%20light%20e-bikes%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9552%2Fribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Ribble%20Endurance%20ridiculously%20light%20e-bikes%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9552%2Fribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9552/ribble-endurance-ridiculously-light-e-bikes-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/ribble_endurance_al_e_14.jpg?itok=WbJ3KJk4\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/e-bikes\">E-bikes</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c7ed6660d91042a138868e0727aab757228c6fb663b50a0d90bd265399a52ca7","category":"Cycling"}
