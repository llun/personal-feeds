While this isn't the lowest price we've tracked, more substantial price drops for the Joy-Cons have been uncommon over the past year. Those dealing with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/report-nintendo-quietly-owns-up-to-joy-con-drift-will-repair-for-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">busted Joy-Con</a> can seek a <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/ask/ht/789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">repair through Nintendo</a>, but for anyone else in need of a spare set, this deal should lessen the blow compared to buying directly from the company. You'll see the discounted price in your cart, but be aware that not all finishes are discounted and that there's currently a bit of a shipping delay on most options.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, our deals roundup includes the lowest price we've seen to date on the entry-level model of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bmnY3n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple's newest Mac mini</a>, which comes equipped with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/mac-mini-and-apple-silicon-m1-review-not-so-crazy-after-all/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the company's powerful M1 chip</a>. We also have discounts on a recommended compact (60 percent) gaming keyboard from Razer, Apple's iPad Air and iPhone 12 MagSafe Charger, a few Roomba vacuums, lots of video games, and more. You can have a look at the full list below.</p>\n<div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-newsletter-callbox full\" data-list-id=\"248915\">\n    <div class=\"ars-newsletter-callbox-container\">\n        <div class=\"ars-newsletter-callbox-header\">    \n            <h5 class=\"ars-newsletter-callbox-title\">\n                Dealmaster: An Ars newsletter\n            </h5>\n            <span class=\"ars-dotted-pattern\"></span>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-newsletter-callbox-content\">    \n            <div class=\"ars-newsletter-callbox-description\">The Dealmaster has launched its very own newsletter!
