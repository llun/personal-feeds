That equates to 12.5 million unused children's bikes across the country.</p>\n<p>The study also showed that just under half of adults with children between five and 11 years old have an unused child's bike with more than 10% storing them for over four years. The biggest offenders were in the Midlands where 14% of adults have stored kids bikes for over 10 years.</p>\n<p>The Bike Club's research said that 20% of those with unused kids' bikes said it was because 'it's too much hassle to sell'.</p>\n<p>While we clearly have to be careful about extrapolating data, the study shows the potential of the circular economy to help reduce strain on the industry. </p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9397/the-sky-is-looking-less-blue-as-paris-roubaix-2021-increasingly-uncertain\">&#039;The sky is looking less blue&#039; as Paris-Roubaix 2021 increasingly uncertain</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/976/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Flanders 2021: Route, start list, sportive and all you need to know</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/2252/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2021: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 111: on sale now!</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: All we know so far</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nJames Symes, co-founder of the Bike Club, said: 'While interest in cycling has soared during the pandemic, 2020 and the start of 2021 have been marred by a severe shortage of bikes as retailers across the UK have struggled to meet unprecedented levels of demand.</p>\n<p>'With over an estimated 38 million unused bikes in the UK, we must look at other ways in which we can meet the current demand for cycling.'</p>\n<p>He added, 'We are proud to have created a zero-hassle solution for anyone looking to unload an unwanted kids bike. Our reCycle scheme gives people the ability to sell their kids bike, get it picked up from their doorstep for free and make some money. </p>\n<p>'This means it's great for their pocket and great for the environment too. Upon collection, our expert mechanics put it through a comprehensive safety check, change any worn out parts and then give it a new lease of life with one of our lovely members.'</p>\n<p>For more information on the Bike Club, visit <a href=\"https://thebikeclub.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">thebikeclub.co.uk</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/bikes\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"a643c73b318f4eb2297a5e2cf846b2cfc80d2fbb7c91475541c37ec3f9b587f8","category":"Cycling"}
