(credit: Anne Epstein)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>When 90-year-old Aaron Epstein bought a Wall Street Journal print ad to complain about his slow AT&amp;T Internet service, the impact was immediate. Reporters like me called him and wrote articles, talk of his plight went viral on the Internet, his ad made an appearance on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6eDIFJvW0gQ?list=PLiZxWe0ejyv92RSYPiA1AcKYiOZtRVABO&amp;t=143\">Stephen Colbert's Late Show</a>, TV networks interviewed him for nightly news broadcasts, and AT&amp;T executives sprang into action to minimize the public-relations damage.</p>\n<p>Now, barely a week later, Epstein's home in North Hollywood, California, has AT&amp;T fiber service with unlimited data and advertised speeds of 300Mbps in both directions. In a speed test yesterday, download speeds were 363Mbps and upload speeds were 376Mbps. It's a gigantic upgrade over the \"up to\" 3Mbps DSL he and his wife, Anne, struggled with before.</p>\n<p>Normally, complaints about AT&amp;T DSL don't lead to fiber-to-the-home upgrades the next week, as AT&amp;T has essentially <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/10/life-in-atts-slow-lane-millions-left-without-fiber-as-company-kills-dsl/\">abandoned the old phone network</a> in large parts of the country where AT&amp;T has not deemed it profitable enough to install state-of-the-art technology. But it appears we have discovered what it takes to kick AT&amp;T into its fastest fiber-installation mode, and the answer is a quarter-page Wall Street Journal print ad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741841#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741841&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"71ecbb2cc98288b02dc7aff50e973431a9a1ed5ee2919fa95d877f4f24b0b3c0","category":"Tech"}
