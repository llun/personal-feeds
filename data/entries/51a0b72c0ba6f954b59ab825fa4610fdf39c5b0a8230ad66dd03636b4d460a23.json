Some reports have suggested that he is still talking to the squad about a possible extension, but a recent interview with Bora-Hansgrohe manager Ralph Denk in Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger cast doubt on the likelihood of Sagan staying with the squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should Sagan find himself in the market for a new team, L&#8217;Equipe reports that he may have a suitor in Deceuninck-QuickStep. According to the French newspaper, Sagan&#8217;s agent Giovanni Lombardi has suggested the deal, and Sagan&#8217;s ties to Specialized could be instrumental in making it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 31-year-old Slovakian has ridden on Specialized bikes for years, and his initial move to Bora-Hansgrohe came in conjunction with the arrival of Specialized as the team&#8217;s bike sponsor. Now that he could be hitting the open market again soon, the involvement of Specialized could again prove decisive in determining his destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deceuninck-QuickStep has had to make hard decisions on which of its big names to re-sign in recent years, and on Tuesday, the team announced that it had signed Remco Evenepoel to the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/remco-evenepoel-signs-the-longest-extension-a-deceuninck-quickstep-rider-has-ever-signed/\">longest extension the team has ever signed</a>. Even if Sagan signs for less than he is currently making, which is reportedly in the neighborhood of €5 million per year, his signing with Deceuninck-QuickStep would require a substantial boost in the team&#8217;s budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it remains to be seen what Specialized has in mind for the future, the American bike brand could help provide financial backing for Sagan to make switch to Deceuninck-QuickStep, which already rides Specialized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L&#8217;Equipe reports out that Deceuninck-QuickStep manager Patrick Lefevere has not always had the best relationship with Sagan&#8217;s agent, but the prospect of adding the three-time world champ to the squad remains an attractive one, particularly for a manager who has had success getting the best out of his stable of talented Classics riders in recent years.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/report-links-peter-sagan-to-possible-move-to-deceuninck-quickstep/\">Report links Peter Sagan to possible move to Deceuninck-QuickStep</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"51a0b72c0ba6f954b59ab825fa4610fdf39c5b0a8230ad66dd03636b4d460a23","category":"Cycling"}
