During his tenure at Apple, Ive oversaw the development and design of revolutionary products, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, iPod, MacBook, and the ‌iMac‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple confirmed to <em>Wired</em> that Ive did indeed work on the new ‌iMac‌ but stopped short of confirming or denying whether his own firm, LoveFrom, aided Apple in designing the computer after he left the company.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>But Apple has another reason to reference this old campaign. Jony Ive was involved in the design of this new ‌iMac‌, despite having left Apple back in 2019. Hardware design is a long process, so perhaps it’s not surprising that Ive’s fingerprints are all over this new desktop. But, interestingly, Apple would not confirm or deny if he worked on the 2021 ‌iMac‌ after he left the company – just that he had worked on it.</blockquote>The 24-inch ‌iMac‌ is the first redesign to the ‌iMac‌ in years, featuring a significantly thinner design, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Apple silicon chip, and comes in seven vibrant colors.
