Among them, why is Facebook autogenerating pages for white supremacist groups?</p>\n<p>Researchers at the Tech Transparency Project <a href=\"https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/white-supremacist-groups-are-thriving-on-facebook\">found</a> that Facebook created dozens of pages for groups like the “Universal Aryan Brotherhood Movement” when a user did something as simple as listing it as their employer. Some of the autogenerated pages garnered thousands of likes by the time they were discovered by researchers. TTP also discovered four Facebook groups that had been created by users. The researchers shared their findings with Facebook, which removed most of the pages. Yet, two of the autogenerated pages and all four Facebook groups remained active when the group published its findings.</p>\n<p>Facebook reportedly banned “white nationalist” content following the 2019 mass shooting at a New Zealand mosque, expanding on an earlier ban of white supremacist content.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752111#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752111&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a656b2ff889265f1680978c2b1c170d92d5fc6c9286890bc4439d3de8ad1297","category":"Tech"}
