{"title":"Apple Faces Another iPhone Lawsuit Over 'Programmed Obsolescence'","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-lawsuit-programmed-obsolescence-portugal/","date":1614609840000,"content":"Apple faces a new class-action lawsuit that accuses it of deliberately releasing iOS updates that slowly reduce the performance of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, forcing customers to upgrade their devices.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/iphone-6-in-hand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1593\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-765183\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe lawsuit comes from the Portuguese Consumer Protection Agency, Deco Proteste (via <em><a href=\"https://marketeer.sapo.pt/deco-proteste-leva-apple-a-tribunal-para-defender-115-mil-portugueses-lesados\">Marketeer</a></em>), which in a <a href=\"https://www.deco.proteste.pt\">statement</a> says that it will proceed with a case against the Cupertino tech giant because it \"deliberately manipulated, and without informing its users, the performance of its most popular devices... in doing so, it forced thousands of users to replace the battery of their devices or buy a new smartphone, to their expectations.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn particular, the agency references the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus, but says any Portuguese consumer, regardless of which &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model they have, can join in its fight to defend their \"economic interests\" and the environment. Additionally, the agency pinpoints the release of iOS 11 as the start of the case. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the agency, Apple was aware that the update would \"have considerable impacts on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; performance.\" Yet, it still \"encouraged its users to update the devices.\" Those who did update their device were \"faced with a slow phone, with a weak performance and unexpected \"blackouts,\" according to the statement. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>Aware that it would cause slowness in devices, performance breaks, and unexpected blackouts, Apple encouraged &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6, 6 Plus, 6S, or 6S Plus users to update their devices with the latest version of their operating system. In doing so, he knew they would prefer new iPhones, not other brands, given the high loyalty of their customers.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDeco Proteste and Euroconsumer, a more extensive European consumer protection agency group, say they've been attempting to come to a resolution for consumers impacted by Apple's \"programmed obsolescence\" for the past three years, but have had no luck. Apple was forced to pay a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/10/24/italy-fining-apple-iphone-throttling/\">fine of 10 million euros</a> in Italy following an Italian consumer protection agency investigation. Deco Proteste says \"Portuguese consumers deserve the same treatment,\" hence its intent to move forward with the lawsuit.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTNzMYC51mc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs part of its push to encourage Portuguese consumers to join in their legal battle, Deco Proteste has produced a short video titled \"Some apples are spoiled ahead of time.\" The agency is also encouraging the use of the hashtag #stopobsolescenciaiiPhone6.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/\">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-lawsuit-programmed-obsolescence-portugal/\">Apple Faces Another iPhone Lawsuit Over &#039;Programmed Obsolescence&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-another-iphone-lawsuit-over-programmed-obsolescence.2286647/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nHsDk_VLNlc:RKDPHOfxVYo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nHsDk_VLNlc:RKDPHOfxVYo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nHsDk_VLNlc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d5c336bf9cc3dab865d4f82e2fffd7dd5b34aca694e6084c78303287cbc7fa29","category":"Apple"}
