Any traces of autumn take a bow and we’re left with winter in its purest form. The woods turn to deep, dark, earthy shades and seem devoid of life. Temperatures and traction drop hand-in-hand and rides seem to be first and foremost about escaping the house with anything beyond that considered a bonus. Autumn is long gone, spring is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>It’s in that deepest and darkest chapter of the winter that we really found a certain special something. Numb fingers, wet arses, frozen toes but plenty of rewards alongside, albeit hard earned ones.</p><p>And so, we created The Tipping Point as a little tribute to everything we as cyclists have experience in the winter and to welcome in the Spring.</p><p>The Tipping Point was created as a not-for-profit passion project using the shared talents of a group of cyclists and creatives from Bristol, UK.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Credits:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Written by:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamie_wideopen/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jamie Edwards</a><br>Spoken By: Jules Clayton</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rider:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fergus_ryan93/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fergus Ryan</a><br>Co-Director/Cinematographer:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/domjohn_dop/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dominic John</a><br>Co-Director/Producer: Jamie Edwards</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gimbal Operators:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ollyjelley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Olly Jelley</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jacobgibbinsphoto/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jacob Gibbins</a><br>Stills Photographer: Jacob Gibbins</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colourist:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/colourbyrogers/?igshid=lrwpvtk1dth8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">John Rogers</a><br>Sound Design &amp; Mix: Joe Simmons / Lab Grown Music</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/the-tipping-point-a-thank-you-letter-to-winter/\">The Tipping Point, a &#8216;thank you&#8217; letter to winter</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Caley Fretz","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"5319c4debbd359e1166e324baacda7f906f50b1799b3b215445f1fb937b23b73","category":"Cycling"}
