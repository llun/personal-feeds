Like sibling brand Hyundai's Ioniq 5, the EV6 will use a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/\">new 800 V electric car platform called E-GMP</a>, which boasts extremely rapid fast charging and a raft of other interesting design details. On Tuesday night, Kia took over Times Square in Manhattan to formally unveil the EV6 in the US, ahead of deliveries scheduled for early 2022.</p>\n<p>Hyundai went for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/this-crisp-looking-crossover-is-hyundais-next-ev-the-ioniq-5/\">a rather retro look for the Ioniq 5</a>. Instead of looking backward, Kia chose to clad the EV6 in a crossover body that's more than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/the-fastest-suv-our-first-drive-in-lamborghinis-641-horsepower-urus/\">a little reminiscent of the Lamborghini Urus</a>. That comparison might get a little more pointed in late 2022 when the EV6 GT arrives—that one will beat the Lamborghini SUV in a drag race, at least to 60 mph.</p>\n<h2>Four powertrain configurations</h2>\n<p>Kia has announced four different powertrain combinations for the EV6. The entry-level EV6 will come with a 58 kWh battery and a single 167 hp (125 kW) electric motor driving the rear wheels. A second rear-wheel-drive EV6 will be available with a larger 77.4 kWh battery pack and 218 hp (162 kW) from its motor.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766083#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766083&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
