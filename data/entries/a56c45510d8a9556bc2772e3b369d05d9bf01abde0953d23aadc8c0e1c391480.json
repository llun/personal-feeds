{"title":"Scott Forstall Encouraged Pandora to Jailbreak iPhones to Get a Head Start on Early App Store Development","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/scott-forstall-pandora-jailbreak-iphone-app-store/","date":1614799770000,"content":"When the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> first launched in 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs had no plans to allow developers to create native apps for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, instead suggesting they rely on web apps. Developers weren't happy with the decision, and by October 2007, Apple decided that it would make a software developer kit and a full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> available to developers by February 2008.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/08/pandora-radio-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-516795\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the lead up to the launch of native &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, popular music streaming app Pandora was growing rapidly and was eager to be the first to get an app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by any means necessary, according to an <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8q8a/how-pandora-won-its-royalty-battle-but-lost-the-war-to-spotify\">in-depth look at Pandora's history</a> shared today by <em>Vice</em>'s Tyler Hayes.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAhead of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s debut, Pandora had been working to get its streaming radio service on flip phones with carriers like Sprint and AT&amp;T, an effort that wasn't particularly successful. Once the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was announced, Pandora knew it was the new big \"music player\" device and the company's mobile development resources needed to be focused on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThen Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall invited Pandora co-founder Tim Westergren and his CTO, Tom Conrad, to lunch in Cupertino. After an hours-long talk over what Pandora had learned putting streaming audio apps on flip phones, Conrad asked Forstall what Pandora could do to get a head start on a mobile app. Forstall's response was surprising - jailbreak an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<blockquote>\"What, if anything, can we do at Pandora to get ready for the next generation of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that includes an app store and native APIs?\" asked Conrad. \"Forstall said, it wouldn't be a waste of your time to jailbreak some iPhones and use the kind of back door toolkits that were being distributed by other people to build a native Pandora app while we get our act together at Apple on something more formal.\"</blockquote>Pandora's engineers did just what Forstall suggested, jailbreaking a series of iPhones and getting to work on a Pandora &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; app ahead of when Apple released official support for native apps. When the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; launched in 2008, Pandora was the first radio app that was available, and the work paid off - nine months later, Pandora was installed on 21 percent of iPhones.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8q8a/how-pandora-won-its-royalty-battle-but-lost-the-war-to-spotify\">full <em>Vice</em> piece</a> from Tyler Hayes is well worth a read for those who are interested in Pandora's early days, early battles over royalty rates, and its efforts to remain relevant as music services like Spotify and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> dominate the market.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pandora/\">Pandora</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/scott-forstall-pandora-jailbreak-iphone-app-store/\">Scott Forstall Encouraged Pandora to Jailbreak iPhones to Get a Head Start on Early App Store Development</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/scott-forstall-encouraged-pandora-to-jailbreak-iphones-to-get-a-head-start-on-early-app-store-development.2286939/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P9XWgamAmhk:iuhPs5GlLAk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P9XWgamAmhk:iuhPs5GlLAk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/P9XWgamAmhk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a56c45510d8a9556bc2772e3b369d05d9bf01abde0953d23aadc8c0e1c391480","category":"Apple"}
