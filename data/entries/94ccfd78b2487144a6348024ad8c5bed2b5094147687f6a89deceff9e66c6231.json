(credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.xbox.com/\">Xbox</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Xbox owners soon won't need to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to enjoy otherwise free-to-play games on their consoles. <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/24/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-2104-210323-0000/\">Wednesday's update</a> to the Xbox Alpha Insiders Update Preview program (version 2104.210323-0000) notes that \"Multiplayer in Free-to-play games, Looking 4 Groups and Party Chat on Xbox no longer requires an Xbox Live Gold membership.\" These features are being tested with Insiders \"ahead of general availability,\" according to the update.</p>\n<p>Microsoft first announced this move <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/xbox-live-price-increase-sets-a-new-10-month-floor-for-online-access/\">back in January</a> as the company was busy rolling back a controversial planned increase in Xbox Live Gold prices. Back then, Microsoft said the free-to-play change was coming \"as soon as possible in the coming months,\" but the rollout to Insiders suggests it will be reaching all Xbox players imminently.</p>\n<p>Microsoft's decision here brings the service in line with its major console competitors. When Sony <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2013/10/30/ps4-the-ultimate-faq-north-america/#sect8\">started charging for multiplayer gameplay on PlayStation Network in 2014</a>, it included a specific carve-out for \"a selection of free-to-play multiplayer titles [that] will be available without a PS Plus membership.\" Nintendo included a similar carve-out for free-to-play titles like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/fortnite/\"><em>Fortnite</em></a> when it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/\">started charging for its Switch Online service in 2018</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752198#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752198&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94ccfd78b2487144a6348024ad8c5bed2b5094147687f6a89deceff9e66c6231","category":"Tech"}
