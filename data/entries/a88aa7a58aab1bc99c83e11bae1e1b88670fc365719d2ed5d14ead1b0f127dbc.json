{"title":"Review: SwitchEasy's MagDoka and MagStand Add MagSafe Compatibility to iPhone 11 Models","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/review/switcheasy-magdoka-and-magstand/","date":1614375154000,"content":"<a href=\"https://switcheasy.com\">SwitchEasy</a> recently came out with a series of \"<a href=\"https://immageasy.com\">MagEasy</a>\" accessories that are designed to add <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> compatibility to older devices or to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-12-cases/\">iPhone 12 cases</a> that aren't equipped with built-in magnets.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magdoka-switcheasy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1098\" height=\"618\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785903\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe MagDoka is a circle-shaped magnetic ring that attaches to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; case using adhesive. It's 2mm thin and doesn't add a lot of bulk to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and in my testing, it adhered well and didn't budge, even when used with an upright &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger that caused a similar product to lose its adhesive.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magdoka.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785904\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nTo keep from blocking charging capabilities, the MagDoka needs to be placed in a specific spot on an older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so SwitchEasy includes a series of templates that ensure accurate positioning. There are guides for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a>, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, and all four <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magdoka-on-iphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2001\" height=\"1404\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785905\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe idea is to peel off the appropriate guide for your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and then line it up accurately on the back of the device. There's a cutout where the MagDoka accessory needs to be placed to be in line with the wireless charging coil inside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. SwitchEasy includes tools for making sure the surface of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is free from dust and grime before the MagDoka is placed to ensure the best adhesion.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magdoka-guide.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785906\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nOnce in place, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; case will be able to attach to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories and chargers. Adding a magnet to an &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; will let it work with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; items, but when it comes to charging, it's <em>not</em> going to charge faster. &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; models are limited to a maximum of 7.5W charging when charged with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers, unlike &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; models that can charge at up to 15W (12W for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magdoka-magsafe-iphone-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1501\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785907\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe MagDoka was simple to apply and made my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/\">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> compatible with the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers that I now have on hand for the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;, so this is an accessory that's convenient in a mixed device household. It's also useful if you have a case without &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; that you just can't live without.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magdoka-on-belkin-magsafe.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785908\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAlongside the MagDoka, there's another MagEasy accessory, the MagStand. When attached to an &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;, it adds &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; connectivity but as the name suggests, it also has a fold out stand option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magstand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785909\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nYou can fold up the bottom portion of the MagStand to turn it into a little &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; stand that can prop an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; up in landscape mode. Since it has &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; capability built in, it works with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories when unfolded.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith the &zwnj;iPhone 11 Pro Max&zwnj;, one of the heaviest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, I didn't find the stand to be particularly useful. It propped up my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; a bit, but the angle was relatively low and I would have preferred more lift. I think it might work slightly better with a lighter &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; because it does sag a bit, but it's still going to be a low angle. The MagStand also had a tendency to cause the adhesive backing to peel up a bit when used in stand mode, so I question its longevity.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magstand-iphone-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1543\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785910\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nBoth the MagDoka and the MagStand are made from leather and are available in pink, blue, and black, and these accessories are lightweight and unassuming when placed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or a case. I preferred the design of the MagDoka to the MagStand just because it takes up less real estate on the back of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSwitchEasy also makes a <a href=\"https://immageasy.com/collections/everyday-case\">series of MagSafe cases</a> specifically designed for the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; lineup. Made from clear or black plastic, the cases are malleable and have a magnetic ring at the back to make them compatible with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories. The cases are priced at &#36;24.99 to &#36;29.99.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe MagDoka and MagStand are most useful for &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; owners because they add compatibility with the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging accessories that are becoming more commonplace.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/switcheasy-magsafe-case.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1414\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785911\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nI don't think the MagDoka is particularly useful for &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; models because it's a better idea to just get a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; case if you want &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; capabilities, but it's great if you have an &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe MagStand has the potential to be useful because of the built-in stand function and the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; compatibility, but I just wasn't a fan of the stand feature and preferred the simpler functionality of the MagDoka.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/magstand-switcheasy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"998\" height=\"607\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785913\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAt &#36;25 these accessories are on the expensive side, but &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging accessories are convenient with the magnetic alignment so it's nice to have that functionality even if you don't have an &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; or if you want a non-MagSafe case.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>How to Buy</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nAll of the MagEasy accessories <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=MagEasy&me=A3EO3EVD3MTSPL\">can be purchased from Amazon</a>. Case pricing starts at &#36;20, with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WH7S467\">the MagDoka</a> available for &#36;16 and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RB18STS\">the MagStand</a> available for &#36;20.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em><small>Note: SwitchEasy provided MacRumors with a MagStand, MagDoka, and &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Case for the purpose of this review.
