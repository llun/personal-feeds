This frame really started as a pair of Shimano UF, semi-vertical dropouts, lying on the Schauff table at Eroica South Africa. I bought them on a whim, after enjoying a few beers at the finish line of the 2020 event. At that moment I thought I would hang them on a keychain or hand them over to a friend, Dave Mercer of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mercerbikes\" target=\"_blank\">Mercer Bikes</a>.<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/16-18A1492D-522D-4CB0-A587-69F641E158E5-69439-000013C40EED6701.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If I’m honest with myself, there was a tiny kernel of an idea that I could build a bike with them. Although, when this was unfolding in early March, South Africa had yet to go into its hard lockdown and the idea seemed so outlandish that I didn’t give it room to grow. Building a hand-made steel bike had long sat near the top of my bucket list, filed away with all the things I’ll probably never have funds or opportunity to pursue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/13-A2FB35DE-9FA3-4072-8CDD-406E2DB9EBC8-69439-000013C3EB52EF8E.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As it happened, when I took the dropouts to Dave, he mentioned that he had been toying with the idea of offering a frame-building course – one-on-one stewardship through the process of designing and building a custom steel frame. He’d built a custom tourer/commuter for me 5 years before and I have some modern mountain bikes but had never owned an out-and-out road racing frame, with modern parts and geometry. Through the course of the 3-week hard lockdown, the idea grew (full-disclosure, I obsessed for countless hours over geometry and frame details) and Dave and I exchanged emails.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/9-23DCD9AD-CA2C-4106-862A-82FF1194776B-69439-000013C3A73C5205.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When we could get back into his workshop, we started the process of building my frame. The silhouette and details are an homage to some of my favourite steel frames – my introduction to road riding was through classic 70s and 80s steel frames. A few choice details include the fast-back, seatpost binder of a 1984 Raleigh Panasonic Team replica, a brake bridge inspired by a Gazelle Champion Mondial, and the scalloped stays of many great Italian frames.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/5-49937880-ED67-49BD-ADD3-64FD53133D30-69439-000013C371CADD53.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The build proved both easier and much harder than I had expected. I run a small furniture workshop and am not nervous around power tools, metalworking machinery, or hand tools, but the brazing. was. terrifying. The tubing wall-thickness, tolerances, and metallurgic heat properties all made the brazing a truly anxiety-provoking process. At least at first. Over the course of the build and under Dave’s watchful eye, I was able to find some flow while brazing. And luckily for me, all the fillets and other brazing is hidden underneath a powder-coat finish.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/2-3872DFFA-FC19-4F62-A16A-163973C7651D-69439-000013C4C0B42743-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The end of the build was a bit of a blur; I was starting to pick up my own work again and trying to get out of Dave’s hair. I sent the bike off to be coated and received it back the day before a 150km Strava-based race called SXSE – mixed surfaces, beautiful landscapes and sure to be a trial by fire. The ride was flawless, comfortable, and fast. I had to keep reminding myself that the frame between my legs was something that I had made.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/19-D4EE10C9-70E8-4266-A55D-2A0C738A0A74-69439-000013C4422BB22D.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After almost 10 years of making things in my workshop, and thousands of objects later, this frame is among those that I am most proud of. Luckily, unlike most of the things I make, I can keep this one.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e1973b36e2cf9d79996ca7c2e5f158f9156bff8e8d1ae1a7c86594c733d9a2c2","category":"Cycling"}
