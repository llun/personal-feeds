(credit: Ars Technica)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p><strong>UPDATE (12pm ET)</strong>: We've added our first batch of new discounts, headlined by the return of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-2021-best-early-deal-gift-card-credit/\" target=\"_blank\">a deal we highlighted</a> a few weeks back: those who buy at least $40 in Amazon gift cards can <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wQG1I2\" target=\"_blank\">get an extra $10 in Amazon credit</a> at no extra cost. As before, Amazon says it'll email the credit to you within two days of your purchase. The credit will only be applicable to items sold by Amazon itself, and you'll have to spend it by August 7. Deals like these are a way for Amazon to keep customers locked into its store, but if you plan on buying from the site anyway, it's a nifty plus.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Apple's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wJD7Fa\" target=\"_blank\">latest iPad Air</a> is now down to a joint-low of $520, and we've found new deals on Nvidia's Shield TV, recommended board games <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/ars-technicas-ultimate-board-game-gift-guide-2019-edition/8/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dixit</em></a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2015/11/ars-cardboard-mysteriums-dreamy-world-is-ghostly-good-fun/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mysterium</em></a>, a good Anker battery pack, and more. Since this post first went live, we've also put together roundups for those looking to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021-under-50/\" target=\"_blank\">spend less than $50</a> and those <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021-target-best-buy-walmart/\" target=\"_blank\">who don't subscribe to Prime</a> but still want some savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Original post</strong>: Amazon Prime Day has arrived, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gP8SpJ\" target=\"_blank\">another avalanche of deals</a> has come along with it. As ever, the vast majority of the gadget and gear discounts Amazon is advertising aren't that special: many of the products are mediocre, and many of the prices aren't much lower than usual.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774658#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1774658&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"844edf634e36819b759bb805cca9ac9c59fc7801637f6670c28c63e3160b5c48","category":"Tech"}
