{"title":"MacRumors Giveaway: Win a MagSafe-Compatible 2-in-1 Charger From Choetech","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/macrumors-giveaway-magnetic-charger-choetech/","date":1619805623000,"content":"For this week's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/giveaway/\">giveaway</a>, we've teamed up with Choetech to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SJNYWYJ\">2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger</a>, which is compatible with Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/choetech-magnetic-charger-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SJNYWYJ\">Priced at $46</a>, the Magnetic Wireless Charger is has a magnetic charger designed for an ‌iPhone 12‌, and base that houses another charger for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Magnetic Wireless Charger is not <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> and cannot charge an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at 15W, but it does charge at 7.5W like Qi-based chargers and is less expensive than ‌MagSafe‌ 2-in-1 charging options that cost upwards of $100. 7.5W is more than sufficient for overnight charging or charging throughout the day on a desk, so a non-MagSafe option can be ideal if you're looking to save some money.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/choetech-magnetic-charger-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause this is a MagSafe-compatible charger the main charging surface is designed for an ‌iPhone 12‌, 12 mini, 12 Pro, or 12 Pro Max and won't work with an earlier ‌iPhone‌ model. There is a secondary charging spot for the ‌AirPods‌ that technically works with an ‌iPhone‌, but it's 2.5W charging so best suited to Apple's earbuds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can position an ‌iPhone 12‌ in either landscape or portrait mode, so the charger is also ideal for watching videos, FaceTiming, and other similar activities. An LED light confirms the charging status of the ‌iPhone‌ and ‌AirPods‌ at the same time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/choetech-magnetic-charger-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Magnetic Wireless Charger comes with a 30W Power Adapter so you don't need to worry about supplying your own like you do with Apple's charging options, and it has an included 3.3-foot USB-C cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe have 15 of the Magnetic Wireless Chargers to give away to <em>MacRumors</em> readers.
