Still, I feel like these last five builders represent the kinds of bikes the readership here at the Radavist enjoys. There are some real gems in this last gallery. Without further adieu, here’s an in-depth look at Weiss, Breadwinner, Moots, a new brand called Pine, and Mosaic…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Weiss-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Weiss-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Weiss-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.weismfg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Weis Manufacturing</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/weismfg/\" target=\"_blank\">@WeisMFG</a></p>\n<p>Brooklyn’s Weis Manufacturing brought along one of their asymmetric gravel bikes for the ENVE event and it literally made my jaw drop when I saw it. A carbon seat tube and ISP are the constructivist achievements of this wonderfully detailed gravel machine but it’s the Krylon spraypaint hydro-dip paint job that solidified my love for what this bike has going on. The ee-Wing cranks and Absolute Black ring just tie the room together, dude.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Breadwinner-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Breadwinner-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Breadwinner-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://breadwinnercycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Breadwinner Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/breadwinnercycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@BreadwinnerCycles</a></p>\n<p>You’re a bad boy, Otis. Breadwinner’s flagship rowdy hardtail continues to impress. This year’s build features a supergraphic quad-color paint coat and a stance that commands your attention. Well done, team!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Moots-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Moots-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Moots-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://moots.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Moots Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mootscycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@MootsCycles</a></p>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/12/from-the-masters-of-metal-a-long-term-review-of-the-moots-womble-29er/\" target=\"_blank\">personal affinity for the Womble</a>, so I couldn’t pass up documenting this beautiful build from the team in Steamboat Springs.

His job is to work hand-in-hand with framebuilders and over the years, he’s grown quite the passion for the industry. At the Round Up, Pine launched their introductory frame, the RASA. It’s designed to be run with 700×35, 650×48, and 26×2.3” tires. Additionally, the Custom Dropouts have swappable inserts that allow for rim brake or disc brake use in all of those tire configurations. This RASA features the gravel configuration equipped with 650×47.99 Tires.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Mosaic-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Mosaic-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/2021-ENVE-Open-House-Mosaic-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mosaiccycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mosaic Cycles</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mosaiccycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@MosaicCycles</a></p>\n<p>For this year’s event, Mosaic brought their GT-1 45, a top-level gravel bike with room for 45mm tires. This particular bike was built in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.velosmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Velosmith Bicycle Studio</a> for a specific customer. The frame uses an oversized butted titanium tube set and it’s painted in Mosaic’s signature Tri Fade layout in an insane bass boat fleck. Wow.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p>Well… that’s it for our coverage of the 2021 ENVE Builder Round Up. I wish I could have shot every bike at the show but time wasn’t on my side.
