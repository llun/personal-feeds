He said Facebook is concerned people will opt out because of the prompt, leading to an internet with \"more paywalls\" and where small businesses are unable to reach their customers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFacebook has been in a sustained campaign against the App Tracking Transparency changes in iOS 14.5, claiming that Apple is anti-small business and going as far as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/\">taking out newspaper ads</a>. Federighi said that Apple was not surprised there was pushback from companies like Facebook, but was \"confident it's the right thing.\" He says the delay in implementation (it was originally slated to be enforced months earlier) was not because of backlash but because Apple wanted to give developers time to adjust to the changes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a user declines to allow an app to access the IFDA of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, app developers are also prevented from using other means to create a profile of a user with device data and usage habits. App developers found trying to use covert tracking methods will violate Apple's rules. Federighi said that developers who don't follow the guidelines \"might not be able to provide updates or their apps could even be removed from the store.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers can turn off tracking all together in the Privacy section of the Settings app under \"Tracking,\" or let apps ask on an app by app basis.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/block-apps-from-tracking-idfa/\">How to Prevent Apps From Tracking You in iOS 14.5</a></li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nBusiness owners and ad industry executives told Stern that people should allow tracking to enable relevant ads that pertain to them, to support small businesses, and to keep the internet free. Users who allow apps to ask about tracking will see popups explaining why users should grant permission.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/app-tracking-transparency.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the beta testing period, metrics <a href=\"https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/att-opt-in-rates-higher/\">gathered by AppsFlyer</a> found a 26 percent opt-in rate per app across close to 550 apps, so some users may still opt to use tracking for their favorite brands.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-14-5-features/\">iOS 14.5 Features</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/craig-federighi-talks-app-tracking-transparency/\">Apple's Craig Federighi on App Tracking Transparency: 'Users Deserve and Need Control' of Data</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-craig-federighi-on-app-tracking-transparency-users-deserve-and-need-control-of-data.2293354/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HbUvllHkOKY:hUP4UojmQWg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HbUvllHkOKY:hUP4UojmQWg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HbUvllHkOKY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"61636d5a2e09120f6856a5bd66704bbdaadc7dc930ed4942b9823b276e71f9da","category":"Apple"}
