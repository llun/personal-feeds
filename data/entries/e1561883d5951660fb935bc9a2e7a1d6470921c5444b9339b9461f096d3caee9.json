Better yet, it’s coated with an Aqua Zero DWR face treatment, that helps keep showers from wetting through, although it’s not enough to handle a downpour.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9434/le-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/le_col_pro_aqua_zero_jersey_2.jpg?itok=9xBp-2Di\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>7</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>It’s nicely made, with flatlocked seams and a high, double layer collar. Along with the stretchy waistband and the simple gathered cuffs, that’s enough to keep out direct airflow.</p>\n<p>I like the bright orange colour, which means you should be easily visible, particularly with the hi-viz reflective strip on the middle rear pocket.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/aqua-zero-jersey?variant=33116729507903\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Le Col Pro Aqua jersey now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>You get a valuables pocket with a hidden zip in addition to the usual three large open rear pockets, so there’s plenty of storage room.</p>\n<p>There are black and navy options if you prefer a more stealth look rather than bright orange. The embroidered logos look smart and are low key.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9434/le-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos#6\"><p><span>Image 7 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/le_col_pro_aqua_zero_jersey_7.jpg?itok=dxGWLPh-\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 7 of </span>7</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>The Le Col Pro Aqua Zero jersey is a good bet if you’re towards the extreme ends of normal sizes too. It comes in everything from XS to XXL. That are seven sizes and, Le Col says, should fit chest sizes from less than 84cm right up to 115cm and more</p>\n<p>There’s enough stretch to the fabric used for the Le Col Pro Aqua Zero jersey that fit is unlikely to be an issue.</p>\n<p>But the fabric itself isn’t very windproof, so the Le Col Pro Aqua Zero jersey runs cooler than its 314g weight in size medium would suggest. A heavier weight long sleeved base layer kept me adequately warm at temperatures in the low teens, once I’d warmed up.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9434/le-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/le_col_pro_aqua_zero_jersey_5.jpg?itok=7LxZolBD\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>7</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>If it does warm up during your ride, a heavy duty zip with a substantial puller lets you regulate your temperature with ease. The puller has a very positive action too, so it won’t drop down once you’ve fixed it in position and if you leave it up you can quickly adjust the amount of opening of the zip. There’s a zip garage at the throat to stop the zipper from chafing.</p>\n<p>Conversely when the temperature hit the upper teens, I found the Le Col Pro Aqua Zero jersey a bit too warm, even after swapping to a summer weight base layer. So the temperature range in which it is effective is quite narrow – from around 12C up to 17C – which limits the usefulness of what’s a not inexpensive piece of kit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lecol.cc/products/aqua-zero-jersey?variant=33116729507903\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Le Col Pro Aqua jersey now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>I reckon a more Gabba-like top is a better bet in cooler conditions, as it has the same insulation and water repellent properties but adds more windproofing than a long sleeved jersey and will keep you that bit warmer.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8472/thinking-outside-the-box-what-if-there-were-no-uci-rules\">Thinking outside the box: what if there were no UCI rules?</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9455/gallery-kasper-asgreen-rips-up-the-script-at-the-tour-of-flanders\">Gallery: Kasper Asgreen rips up the script at the Tour of Flanders</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/8984/best-cycling-water-bottles-buyers-guide\">Best cycling water bottles: buyer's guide</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 112: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThat’s not a criticism specific to the Le Col Pro Aqua Zero jersey, but reflects my feeling that the traditional long sleeved jersey has been rather superseded by newer tech.</p>\n<p>Le Col makes a Gabba-style top. The Sport jacket has better windproofing at the front with a DWR coating like the Aqua Zero jersey and it’s only £25 more expensive. It’s arguably a piece you’d expect to get more use from in changeable spring and autumn weather.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9434/le-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos\">Le Col Pro Aqua Zero jersey photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/paul-norman\">Paul Norman</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>1 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9434%2Fle-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Le%20Col%20Pro%20Aqua%20Zero%20jersey%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9434%2Fle-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Le%20Col%20Pro%20Aqua%20Zero%20jersey%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9434%2Fle-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Le%20Col%20Pro%20Aqua%20Zero%20jersey%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9434%2Fle-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9434/le-col-pro-aqua-zero-jersey-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 7</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/le_col_pro_aqua_zero_jersey_1.jpg?itok=Y7de1DWB\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/jerseys\">Jerseys</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/jackets\">Jackets</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e1561883d5951660fb935bc9a2e7a1d6470921c5444b9339b9461f096d3caee9","category":"Cycling"}
