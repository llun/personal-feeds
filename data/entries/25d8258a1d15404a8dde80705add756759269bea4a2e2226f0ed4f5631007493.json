We know that will cause more COVID deaths. By contrast, no deaths are yet associated with this vaccine. It’s unpleasant to measure one set of deaths against another, but that’s precisely what must be done in a public health crisis. If we were able to vaccinate all of the US with the J&amp;J vaccine, we would currently expect to see about 330 issues with blood clots. Meanwhile, more than 560,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID already, with 330 more being killed by COVID <em>every few hours</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The worst part about this is that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is almost certainly our <em>best</em> vaccine. The efficacy numbers aren’t what matters — the J&amp;J vaccine is way more than effective enough. What matters is that it’s single-dose. The single-dose J&amp;J vaccine is the clearest path to pushing our overall nationwide (and worldwide) vaccinated numbers into herd immunity territory, wiping COVID-19 from the face of the earth. It would be a catastrophic mistake to panic over one-in-a-million blood clots (which so far aren’t even deadly) for <em>any</em> of the approved vaccines, but it’s a worst-case scenario to unjustly malign our only highly-effective single-dose vaccine.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/do-less-harm\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"25d8258a1d15404a8dde80705add756759269bea4a2e2226f0ed4f5631007493","category":"Tech"}
