This is equivalent to 10 mph, or a brisk run. During this flight, <em>Ingenuity</em> covered about 625 meters.</p>\n<p>A little more than two months have passed since <em>Ingenuity</em>'s first flight, on April 19 of this year. During that initial test, the helicopter hovered to about 3 meters above the ground before landing again. Since then, the engineering team behind the helicopter has pushed the vehicle higher, farther, and faster across the surface of Mars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778452#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778452&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"39c75426f75d5124ee73b92c178bcc78c73992e34ca2308301ca4f653c2e710c","category":"Tech"}
