He was 82. […]</p>\n\n<p>In a design career of more than 40 years, Mr. Blackburn developed\nbrand imagery for clients like IBM, Mobil and the Museum of Modern\nArt. But he is best known for the NASA worm, which has become\nsynonymous with space exploration and the concept of the\ntechnological future itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m glad he lived long enough to see NASA <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/nasa-logo-worm-spacex.html\">re-embrace his wonderful logo</a>. It’s such a perfect mark — one that will always feel like a symbol of the future.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Bruce Blackburn, Designer of Ubiquitous NASA Logo, Dies at 82’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/19/blackburn-nasa-logo\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d6f7834f3a2f405843808e28dec734a328d679779e02a56bc78d7412af78dd55","category":"Tech"}
