When the vulnerability was <a href=\"https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/d56afe6836db40cdea22eaa6b47c56a6197a8bab\">fixed almost three weeks ago</a> by open source developers outside of Apple, the fix's release notes said that the bug caused Safari to crash. A researcher from security firm Theori said the flaw is exploitable, and despite the availability of a fix, the bug is still present in iOS and macOS.</p>\n<h2>Mind the gap</h2>\n<p>“This bug yet again demonstrates that patch-gapping is a significant danger with open source development,” Theori researcher Tim Becker wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.theori.io/research/webkit-type-confusion/\">post published Tuesday</a>. “Ideally, the window of time between a public patch and a stable release is as small as possible. In this case, a newly released version of iOS remains vulnerable weeks after the patch was public.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767876#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767876&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bcfe460904ec3c2b3d7cdf3d6bd547c640682fc475f7621bd9bd0161b6eda8fb","category":"Tech"}
