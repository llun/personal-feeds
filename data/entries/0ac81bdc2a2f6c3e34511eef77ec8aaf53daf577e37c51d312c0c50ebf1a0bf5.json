The Snapdragon 700 series is a midrange line that offers similar features to the flagship Snapdragon 800 series but at somewhat lower performance for significantly lower cost.</p>\n<p>On the surface, it's easy to look at last year's Snapdragon 768G and this year's 780G and see a similar product: an octa-core processor with Adreno GPU. But although the core count remained constant, the types of cores did not.</p>\n<p>Earlier Snapdragon 700 series SoCs used one \"fastest\" Cortex A-76 core, another \"almost as fast\" Cortex A-76, and six \"slow-and-low\" Cortex A-55 cores that can get background tasks done with a minimum of battery drain. The new 780G shifts things around, with three fast secondary cores and only four slow cores:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752495#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752495&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ac81bdc2a2f6c3e34511eef77ec8aaf53daf577e37c51d312c0c50ebf1a0bf5","category":"Tech"}
