{"title":"Head-Scratcher of the Day: The NYT Makes Hay Out of the NCAA’s Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournament Budgets","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/sports/ncaabasketball/mens-womens-tournament-gap.html","date":1616792445000,"content":"\n<p>Alan Blinder, reporting for The New York Times, under the outrage-seeking headline “NCAA Acknowledges $13.5 Million Budget Gap Between Men’s and Women’s Tournaments”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The N.C.A.A. budgeted nearly double for its men’s basketball\ntournament in 2019 than what it planned for its women’s\ncompetition, a $13.5 million gap that will assuredly drive\nquestions about the organization’s commitment to gender equity.</p>\n\n<p>The tournaments vary substantially in their formats and\npopularity, and N.C.A.A. executives insist that those differences\nnecessarily account for their budgeting decisions. But a financial\nsummary prepared by the association and reviewed by The New York\nTimes, which included figures that a range of college sports\nexecutives said they had never seen, showed that the N.C.A.A.\ndevoted far more resources to the men’s tournament, which\norganizers said had a net income of about $865 million in 2019.\nThe women’s tournament, officials said, lost $2.8 million, more\nthan any other N.C.A.A. championship competition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why so many people are concerned about the direction of The New York Times. The fact that men’s tournament earned $865 million and the women’s tournament lost nearly $3 million but their budgets are only $13.5 million apart is a sign that the NCAA is clearly committed to gender equality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In an interview on Friday, Kathleen McNeely, the N.C.A.A.’s chief\nfinancial officer, said that organizers “really do strive to have\nparity” between the men’s and women’s tournaments, particularly\naround the student-athlete experience. But she said that public\ninterest in the men’s competition had fueled more ticket sales and\nrequired more spending.</p>\n\n<p>“The men’s tournament is just a larger tournament: 690,000 fans\ncompared to 275,000 in 2019,” she said. “That kind of a difference\nis going to bring in a lot of little costs that are going to drive\nthe difference.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Twice the budget for twice the fans — it’s commensurate. The women’s tournament TV rights are part of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-espn-ncaa/espn-ncaa-extend-deal-through-2023-24-idUSTRE7BE2FM20111215\">a package ESPN signed for the rights to 24 different Division I championships</a>, including women’s basketball, and are worth $36 million per year. The Times claims the NCAA values the women’s basketball tournament as being worth 16 percent of that package: about $6 million per year. The TV rights for the men’s tournament <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/15190549/ncaa-tournament-deal-cbs-turner-extended-2032\">were just extended for $1.1 <em>billion</em> per year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This Times story is clearly presented as exposing a scandal of some degree, when the complete opposite is true: the NCAA is using the immense profits of its most profitable tournament to fund all its other tournaments, of which 95 percent <em>lose money</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Head-Scratcher of the Day: The NYT Makes Hay Out of the NCAA’s Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournament Budgets’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/26/nyt-ncaa-tournaments\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c3aca72024e5f37782b71c77961f2f8e0c401dd89a7a0ac806ca9d824834046d","category":"Tech"}
