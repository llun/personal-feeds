With a provisional name of 'Team Van powered by Ford', the biggest news is the bringing together of arch rivals <a href=\"/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a> and <a href=\"/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a>.</p>\n<p>Pushing each other to extremes of racing achievement across <a href=\"/tags/cyclocross\">cyclocross</a> for a number of years and more recently on the road – with the pair set to take the start line at this weekend's <a href=\"/tags/tour-of-flanders\">Tour of Flanders</a> as joint-favourites – the new team is looking to line the pair up as internal-rivals at all major races next season, believing this approach will guarantee the most victories according to Transit's head of sporting endeavour Erik van Aprilgrap.</p>\n<p>'We've been watching \"the vans\" of cycling and realised the smart money was on backing them all,' explained Van Aprilgrap. 'So that's what we did!'</p>\n<p>He added, 'it's not just our headline men's duo either. We've recruited a number of the best female pros and both teams will be backed by some of the strongest domestiques in the peloton.</p>\n<p>'We're just waiting to hear from the <a href=\"/tags/uci\">UCI</a> as to whether we can drive Transits instead of estate cars in races next year, also.'</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/5604/in-praise-of-e-bikes\">In praise of e-bikes</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/2709/10-reasons-to-buy-an-e-bike\">10 reasons to buy an e-bike</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/tutorials/2678/tutorial-how-to-spring-clean-your-bike\">Tutorial: How to spring clean your bike</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/reviews/690/buyers-guide-choosing-the-best-bike-lock\">Best bike locks: how to keep your bike safe</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAs alluded to by Van Aprilgrap, the rest of the team is hardly there to make up the numbers. Taking on the women's WorldTour, as well as the men's, Team Van powered by Ford will be led by current and most recent previous World Champions Anna van der Breggen and Annemiek van Vleuten, with Ellen van Dijk as road captain.</p>\n<p>Backing up the men's leaders will be <a href=\"/tags/greg-van-avermaet\">Greg Van Avermaet</a>, Dylan van Baarle, Sep Vanmarcke and Tejay van Garderen.</p>\n<p>Sep's brother will also be in the team Transit Van during races as Ken Vanmarke moves over from EF and joins QuickStep's Gert van Bondt on the team's off-bike roster. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"7e173b286dccec5160b8f0ef8d22560e4b283e35e8d52a4e2220e1232fd20f9b","category":"Cycling"}
