But while today's <a href=\"https://avengers.square-enix-games.com/en-us/news/patch-notes-v1-8-0\">patch notes</a> detailed most of these changes, one unexpected error popped up for some players: a new on-screen display, which can't be disabled, that shows each player's home IP address.</p>\n<p>The news emerged primarily as Twitch game streamers began jumping into the game and hosting their sessions to fans, only to notice the line of text—which also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1407370306700906509\">includes the player's console username (à la Xbox's \"Gamertag\") and other apparent numerical indicators</a>—not only appeared on-screen but began bouncing from the top to the bottom of the screen in a way that would prevent a streamer from easily cropping the details for privacy's sake.
