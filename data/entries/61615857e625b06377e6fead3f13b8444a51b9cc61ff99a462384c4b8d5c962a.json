Stewart managed to keep himself upright but was pushed backwards and out of contention in the sprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I admit my mistake in changing my trajectory, but there was nothing intentional,&#8221; Bouhanni said via a statement released by his Arkea-Samsic team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to say that I&#8217;m sorry for Jake Stewart,&#8221; Bouhanni said. &#8220;The sprint went like this: I saw Ã‰lie Viviani launch, and I wanted to take his draft. I admit that my mistake was to change course for go take his wheel. I didn&#8217;t see Jake Stewart at that moment. When we make contact with each other, I found myself unbalanced and I caught myself as best I can so as not to fall. I just wanted to take the slipstream because the wind was coming from the front, right side, in any case it was intentional.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Disciplinary Commission has considerably leeway in determining the proper punishment for such actions, ranging from a fine to long suspensions, as seen in the case of Dylan Groenewegen, who is currently serving a nine-month ban for a similar incident with far great consequences at the Tour of Poland. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bouhanni has a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/nacer-bouhanni-is-still-a-terror/\">long list of altercations</a> on his resume, including a &#8220;violent altercation&#8221; with his own director and a physical fight with Rudy Barbier, another sprinter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stewart went to Twitter Sunday evening to express his distaste at Bouhanni&#8217;s maneuver. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BouhanniNacer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BouhanniNacer</a> I would ask you what you was thinking&#8230;but you clearly have no brain cells.
