It&rsquo;s one of the more natural-sounding virtual assistants, and she&rsquo;s full of personality, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She? Is Siri a &ldquo;she?&rdquo; Not really! Siri actually has no gender (if you don&rsquo;t believe us, just ask it). Siri had a default female voice for many years, but you had the option to change it to a male voice instead. You can even give Siri six different accents: American, Australian, British, Indian, Irish, or South American. (If you&rsquo;re using Siri in non-English language, your choices will probably differ).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/331864/ios-14-5-features-release-date-beta-how-to-install.html\">iOS 14.5</a>, Apple is changing the Siri voice options to promote diversity. There are now two additional American English voices, and they&rsquo;re just labeled Voice 1-4 instead of Male and Female. In addition, Siri will no longer default to a Female choice, but will instead prompt you to pick one of the Siri voice options during setup. </p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif\">\n\t\t<figure><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/e7QNaiPvGmpRHrMa0T\" title=\"not a girl\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure></div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated 03/31/21:</strong> Apple is adding new Siri voices and a change to the default behavior in iOS 14.5. This article has been updated to reflect that.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"change-siris-voice-in-ios\">Change Siri&rsquo;s voice in iOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how to make Siri sound the way you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Open the <em>Settings</em> app, then tap <em>Siri &amp; Search</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Tap on <em>Siri Voice</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Choose the accent and voice you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siri-voice-settings.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-100060586\"><figcaption>You can change the way Siri sounds at any time.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"imageCredit\">IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also go to the Siri menu by asking Siri to change its voice. Siri will tell you it can&rsquo;t do that, but will provide a button to hop right to the appropriate Settings menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the Siri menu also contains a Language selection, which allows Siri to speak and listen in a different language. If you change your language, you&rsquo;ll have to re-train &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; in order for it to work. It can be useful for those with a strong accent to check out this menu. If you&rsquo;ve got an Irish brogue, you will want to make sure Siri&rsquo;s language is set to <em>English (Ireland)</em>, for example. That&rsquo;s different from selecting the Irish &ldquo;variety&rdquo; in the Siri Voice menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"change-siris-voice-in-macos\">Change Siri&rsquo;s voice in macOS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the Mac has Siri, you can of course change its voice there, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Open <em>System Preferences.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Click <em>Siri</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Use the <em>Siri Voice</em> drop-down menu to select a voice, or the <em>Language</em> menu to select a language.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image large\"><a class=\"zoom\" href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/change-siri-voice-macos-100749692-orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/02/change-siri-voice-macos-100749692-large.jpg\" alt=\"change siri voice macos\"></a><figcaption><p>You can change Siri&rsquo;s voice on your Mac, too.</p>\n</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div></body></html>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld readers help decipher the WWDC teasers","siteHash":"b338728ade7919e6b144a75b5cf98f3d86db7c77b45747ff576f28bb6bb6cb3b","entryHash":"a934799eecbe64744b5f04cc64d0b21c2392c40e5d22d2779058ef050c5ccc5a","category":"Apple"}
