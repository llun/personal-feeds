The report shares much more detail about these machines than we've previously been privy to.</p>\n<p>Each of the new computers will include a substantially faster successor to the M1 chip. Bloomberg's sources say the MacBook Pro, which is expected to come in 14-inch and 16-inch variants, could launch as soon as this summer. That suggests Apple may announce the computers at its annual developer conference in early June.</p>\n<p>A totally redesigned MacBook Air will follow, as will an updated Mac mini, which still uses Intel processors. A new 30-inch iMac will replace the current 27-inch Intel model.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765693#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1765693&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0fcee29b33c8b874bfaaae002b657448aced816badc85b77a8e4c908bdce9979","category":"Tech"}
