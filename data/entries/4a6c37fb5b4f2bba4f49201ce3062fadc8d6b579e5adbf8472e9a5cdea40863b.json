The day after that effort was quite ok and the day after that was a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/time-trial\">time-trial</a>. We had three easy days to recover so that should be more than enough.'</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2471/milan-san-remo-2021-who-is-going-to-win\">Despite being favourite</a> to take the win at the season's first Monument, Van der Poel admitted he doesn't really like the race. 'The first 150-200km is just riding in a bunch and trying not to fall asleep so it's not really my kind of racing,' he said.</p>\n<p>'It's one of the most difficult to win because there's not a lot of places where you can force the race. Most of the time you have to wait until the Poggio, but it's difficult to really make a gap.'</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9409/paris-roubaix-wont-take-place-in-april\">Paris-Roubaix will not take place in April</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/2252/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling Spring Classics 2021: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/1105/in-praise-of-cobbles\">In praise of cobbles</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/sponsored/9311/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no21-marianne-vos\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No21: Marianne Vos</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 112: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIn typical favourite fashion, Van der Poel, who beat eternal rival <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a> to the last Monument at the delayed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-of-flanders\">Tour of Flanders</a> last October, was quick to talk up his competitors, 'I think Michael Matthews was really good last year and he has a really fast sprint. He had a really good Paris-Nice as well so I think he will be a guy to watch.'</p>\n<p>He also couldn't rule Van Aert out, 'I think Wout has a little bit of an advantage already in that he has won the race once so I think for him it's a bit easier. But it will be a new race and San Remo is quite an honest race so the strongest normally wins.'</p>\n<p>If Van der Poel does win, he would replicate the feat of his late grandfather, Raymond Poulidor, almost exactly 60 years later. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"4a6c37fb5b4f2bba4f49201ce3062fadc8d6b579e5adbf8472e9a5cdea40863b","category":"Cycling"}
