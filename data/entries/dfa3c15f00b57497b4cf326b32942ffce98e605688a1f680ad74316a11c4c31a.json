Kuo also expects a 48-megapixel camera on some high-end iPhones next year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for this year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/iphone-13-dummy-models-camera-bumps/\">iPhone 13 dummy models surfaced this week</a>, offering a closer look at rumored design changes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Developing a Whole New Kind of MacBook Air</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/21/apple-developing-a-whole-new-kind-of-macbook-air/\">working on a completely new, high-end version of the MacBook Air</a> for release as early as later this year, according to recent reports.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/macbook-air-orange.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Air would likely feature a faster iteration of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">Apple's custom M1 chip</a> for ultra-fast performance in a lightweight design. The current base model MacBook Air with the M1 chip already <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/11/m1-macbook-air-first-benchmark/\">outperforms a maxed-out Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> in benchmarks.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS and iPadOS 15 to Developers</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nTwo and a half weeks after releasing the first betas of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 following the WWDC keynote, Apple this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/ios-15-beta-2/\">seeded the second beta versions</a> to developers. Parallel beta updates for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/watchos-8-beta-2/\">watchOS 8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/tvos-15-beta-2/\">tvOS 15</a> were also

second betas of iOS and iPadOS 15 fix a number of bugs, and also introduce a few new features that weren't in the first betas, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/ios-15-beta-2-enables-shareplay/\">initial support for SharePlay functionality</a> in FaceTime and the ability for apps to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/25/ios-ipados-15-apps-request-for-more-ram/\">request access to additional RAM</a> to improve performance.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a

src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-Leak-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Kang\" has been one of the most reliable Apple leakers over the last few years, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kang/\">several detailed leaks about Apple's future product and software plans</a> that turned out to be correct, and Apple's letter essentially suggests that continued leaks of this nature may result in legal action.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>20 Annoyances Apple Fixed in iOS 15 and macOS Monterey</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWith <a

/>\r\nFollowing widespread reports that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/poor-iphone-12-mini-sales-supply-chain/\">iPhone 12 mini has experienced poor sales performance</a>, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce this week claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/21/iphone-12-mini-end-of-life-trendforce/\">production of the device has already ended</a>.\r\n<br
