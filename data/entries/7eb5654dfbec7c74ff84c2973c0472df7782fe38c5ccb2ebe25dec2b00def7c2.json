Among those is a continuing shift to 16:10 displays, which most productivity users will greatly appreciate compared to the more media-focused 16:9 aspect ratio found in recent prior models.</p>\n<p>There's also human-presence detection; the laptops use a radar sensor to detect when you're sitting down in front of them, and they wake up accordingly. And of course, like so many similar laptops in this day and age, you can get these machines with fingerprint readers built into the power buttons now.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744328#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744328&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7eb5654dfbec7c74ff84c2973c0472df7782fe38c5ccb2ebe25dec2b00def7c2","category":"Tech"}
