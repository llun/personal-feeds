{"title":"Scott Forstall Encouraged Pandora to Begin Developing for iPhone Via Jailbreaking in 2007","link":"https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8q8a/how-pandora-won-its-royalty-battle-but-lost-the-war-to-spotify","date":1615316547000,"content":"\n<p>Tyler Hayes, in an interesting story for Motherboard about Pandora:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After Steve Jobs announced the iPhone in 2007 it became apparent\nthat this new internet connected, “music player,” device in\npeople’s pockets needed to be the future of its mobile efforts.</p>\n\n<p>After pushback on only allowing web apps for the iPhone, Steve\nJobs announced that native apps would be coming to the iPhone. In\nthe interim, Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall invited\nTim Westergren and his CTO, Tom Conrad, over to a local Cupertino\nlunch spot. The trio talked for hours about what Pandora had\nlearned about streaming audio from putting apps on flip phones,\nlike Motorola’s RAZR, for wireless carriers. The meeting ended\nwith a question for Forstall.</p>\n\n<p>“What, if anything, can we do at Pandora to get ready for the next\ngeneration of iPhone that includes an app store and native APIs?”\nasked Conrad. “Forstall said, it wouldn’t be a waste of your time\nto jailbreak some iPhones and use the kind of back door toolkits\nthat were being distributed by other people to build a native\nPandora app while we get our act together at Apple on something\nmore formal.”</p>\n\n<p>So, Conrad, designer Dan Lythcott-Haines, and many others on the\nteam got to work jailbreaking iPhones and working on a Pandora\niPhone app ahead of the official APK release. Then, on day one of\nthe App Store launch, Pandora was the first internet radio app\navailable. Nine months later the Pandora app was installed on 21\npercent of iPhones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Steve Jobs announced Apple’s plans for a third-party SDK on 17 October 2007 (“<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/10/17/iphone-sdk\">no permalink that I can find, alas</a>”), and the SDK and App Store were unveiled by Jobs at a Town Hall event <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1132376/liveupdate.html\">on 6 March 2008</a>. That probably pegs this Forstall-Pandora meeting at the end of 2007, perhaps just after the SDK announcement in October.
