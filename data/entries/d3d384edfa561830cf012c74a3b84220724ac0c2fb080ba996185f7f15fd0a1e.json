Kuo had previously stated that starting next year, Apple will plan to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">abandon the notch for a \"punch-hole\" design</a> for some of its 2022 iPhones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince its debut with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> X, the notch has served primarily to house the TrueDepth camera system which enables Face ID. While Apple is rumored to be planning a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/04/iphone-13-pro-mockup-smaller-notch/\">smaller notch for the 2021 iPhones</a>, presumably, if the tech giant is able to house the facial recognition system under the display, it would remove the need for a notch entirely.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo had also previously stated that at least one high-end ‌iPhone‌ model in 2023 will feature an under-display fingerprint scanner with no notch and a real full-screen display. Kuo provides no specifics with today's note on whether Apple would offer both an under-display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> and Face ID system, or whether under-display Face ID will remain exclusive to the higher-end iPhones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has widely been rumored to adopt an under-display fingerprint scanner, even <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-optical/\">possibly for the iPhone 13</a>. However, this is the first time we've heard of a possible under-display Face ID system. From a technological standpoint, achieving an under-display facial recognition system requires more advanced tooling, given that the TrueDepth camera system must be able to read and recognize faces through the pixels of the display without distorting or interfering with the content.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo also today shared details on the 2022 ‌iPhone‌ lineup, saying that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2022-iphones-no-mini-upgraded-camera/\">Apple plans to abandon the 5.4-inch mini form factor</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tf-international-securities/\">TF International Securities</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/kuo-2023-iphones-under-display-face-id/\">Kuo: Apple to Adopt Under Display Face ID Starting With 2023 iPhones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-to-adopt-under-display-face-id-starting-with-2023-iphones.2291631/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BTxgWUPjQOM:Mc4OpIi08tw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BTxgWUPjQOM:Mc4OpIi08tw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BTxgWUPjQOM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d3d384edfa561830cf012c74a3b84220724ac0c2fb080ba996185f7f15fd0a1e","category":"Apple"}
