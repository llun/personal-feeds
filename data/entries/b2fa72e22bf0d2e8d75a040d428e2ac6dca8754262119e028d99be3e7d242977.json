The other members of the group include Charter, Cisco, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Keysight Technologies, LG, Mavenir, MITRE, and VMware.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn September, AT&T said that it already has engineers working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/21/att-says-5g-iphones-might-not-be-massive-event/\">next-generation 6G networking</a>. Some analysts say the technology could enable speeds more than 100 times faster than 5G, but again, the technology isn't expected to arrive for several years to come.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe move continues a trend of Apple preferring to develop in-house hardware for its devices, rather than relying on third-parties. In 2019, Apple and Qualcomm settled a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">legal battle</a> and reached a multiyear chipset supply agreement that paved the way for Apple to use Qualcomm's 5G modems in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBeyond that, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/apple-qualcomm-5g-modem-roadmap/\">court document</a> from the settlement revealed that Apple will likely use the the Snapdragon X60  modem for 2021 iPhones, followed by the world's first 10 Gigabit 5G modem, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/qualcomm-snapdragon-x65/\">Snapdragon X65</a>, in 2022 iPhones.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Snapdragon X65 could be the last Qualcomm modem used in iPhones, however, as Barclays analysts and multiple other sources have forecasted that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-developing-modem-in-house/\">switch to its own in-house 5G modem</a> for iPhones by 2023.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g/\">5G</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/6g/\">6G</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-seeking-engineers-work-on-6g/\">Bloomberg: Apple Hiring Engineers to Work on 6G Wireless Connectivity</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bloomberg-apple-hiring-engineers-to-work-on-6g-wireless-connectivity.2285189/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GqAcXcLt0Rk:z-4TdYaiI40:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GqAcXcLt0Rk:z-4TdYaiI40:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GqAcXcLt0Rk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b2fa72e22bf0d2e8d75a040d428e2ac6dca8754262119e028d99be3e7d242977","category":"Apple"}
