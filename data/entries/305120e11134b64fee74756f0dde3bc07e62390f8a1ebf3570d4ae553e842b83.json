Weinbach had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/15/iphone-13-always-on-display-stronger-magesafe/\">previously reported</a> that the 2021 iPhones will feature stronger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> magnets, which in today's rumor, he reiterates could be a reason behind the increased coil size.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWeinbach also speculates that the increased coil size could be used for reverse wireless charging, which would enable users to charge wireless charging compatible devices, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, by placing them on the back of the ‌iPhone‌. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn February, <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman stated that reverse wireless charging capabilities are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/iphone-reverse-charging-unlikely-near-future/\">unlikely to come to the iPhone in the \"near future.\"</a> Despite Apple holding off on officially announcing the feature, FCC filings for the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/14/hidden-iphone-12-feature-could-still-be-unlocked/\">revealed earlier this year</a> that all models of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup include the ability to reverse wirelessly charge other devices, such as ‌AirPods‌ (second generation), <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, or newer Apple Watch models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore recently, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Apple is planning reverse wireless charging capabilities <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/\">for the next-generation iPad Pro in 2022</a>. Reverse wireless charging does significantly drain a device's battery, and Apple may feel as though that the feature would make more sense in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, thanks to its larger battery, compared to an ‌iPhone‌.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/max-weinbach/\">Max Weinbach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/everythingapplepro/\">EverythingApplePro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/04/iphone-13-larger-wireless-charging-coil/\">Rumor: iPhone 13 to Feature Larger Wireless Charging Coils, Possibly for Reverse Wireless Charging</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-iphone-13-to-feature-larger-wireless-charging-coils-possibly-for-reverse-wireless-charging.2303175/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P-bR29hWNyQ:33sIbM11jPs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=P-bR29hWNyQ:33sIbM11jPs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/P-bR29hWNyQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"305120e11134b64fee74756f0dde3bc07e62390f8a1ebf3570d4ae553e842b83","category":"Apple"}
