The three 'C's' of Stage 3 of this year's <a href=\"/tags/tour-de-france\">Tour de France.</a> The day that scattered hopes and dreams.</p>\n<p>It should have been a straightforward stage. A 182km from Lorient to Pontivy, with only two categorised climbs that were too far from the finish to cause headaches. A flat run to the line, a sprinter's dream and a General Classification day off. But this is the Tour, there is never a day off. Instead, this was a day of loss. </p>\n<p>Just 37km into the stage came the first act of drama. A touch of wheels sent Ineos Grenadiers team leader <a href=\"/tags/geraint-thomas\">Geraint Thomas</a> flying. The impact saw him land awkwardly and dislocate his shoulder. Made of tough stuff, he managed to get it popped back in, battle to the finish and looks set to start Stage 4. The same cannot be said for <a href=\"/tags/jumbo-visma\">Jumbo-Visma</a>'s Robert Gesink who is already on his way home having also been a victim of the same crash.</p>\n<p>Then into the final 10km, this time it was Jumbo-Visma's <a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\">Primoz Roglic</a>'s turn to touch the tarmac. Landing straight on his coccyx, he escaped broken bones but lost a lot of skin as well 1 minute 21 seconds on the stage.</p>\n<p>With 4km to go, the peloton that was clearly nervous then saw another fall on a tight bend which eventually saw Bahrain-Victorious's Jack Haig abandon the race. Here around half a dozen riders hit the floor with many, including Tadej Pogacar, being caught behind. He would end up losing 26 seconds with Thomas, AG2R-Citroën's Ben O'Connor and Rigoberto Uran of Education-First among others.</p>\n<p>Then, in the final frantic, downhill 200m, one more crash, this time <a href=\"/tags/lotto-soudal\">Lotto-Soudal</a>'s Caleb Ewan taking down <a href=\"/tags/peter-sagan\">Bora-Hansgrohe's Peter Sagan</a> with him. They were both out of the reckoning for the stage, with Ewan now out of the entire Tour.</p>\n<p>In the end, it seemed like the only ones not to lose yesterday were Ineos Grenadier's Richard Carapaz and QuickStep's Julian Alaphillipe, who through luck and skill manage to avoid incident and finish in the front group, and Alpecin-Fenix who made it two in two days with Tim Merlier. Oh, and <a href=\"/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> is still in yellow, of course.</p>\n<p>But rather than Alpecin-Fenix taking yet another win, Stage 3 will always be remembered for the bad.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9141/mens-worldtour-team-bikes-2021-a-breakdown\">Men's WorldTour team bikes 2021: a breakdown </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 115: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nGroupama-FDJ manager Marc Madiot, an emotional man at the best of times, was left apoplectic with what he had seen.</p>\n<p>'I'm a father and I don't want to see my kid be a professional cyclist after what we saw,' Madiot told live French television immediately after the stage. 'It's no longer cycling. We have to change, it's no longer okay. If we do not do that, we will have deaths. It's not worthy of our sport.'</p>\n<p>His hope for the day, Arnuad Demare, had hit the deck 4km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Talking to <em>Sporza</em>, <a href=\"/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a>'s resident locamotive Tim Declercq revealed the peloton had pleaded for action ahead of what was obviously a dangerous final 10km but to no avail.</p>\n<p>'We knew this final was dangerous and that's why the riders asked for the GC times to be clocked at 8km but there was no response.'</p>\n<p>Cofidis rider Simon Gescke vented on Twitter writing, 'Funny how the super-tuck and forearm positions got banned for \"safety reasons\" while at the same time we have finishes like today in #letour.' </p>\n<p>He was backed up by vetran <a href=\"/tags/israel-start-up-nation\">Israel Start-Up Nation</a> sprinter Andre Griepel who added 'Whoever designed today’s stage @LeTour should try to ride with 180 riders on a twisty 5m wide road next to each other and pushing Wachbootes to the limits. Of course we riders make the race at the end but the riders also ask for an earlier time taking 5 km to go which was refused.'</p>\n<p>But this day of carnage was best summarised by Italian <a href=\"/tags/groupama-fdj\">Groupama-FDJ</a> leadout man Jacopo Guarnieri who simply tweeted \"F**k it\".</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9805/tour-de-france-stage-3-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 16</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/tdf-stage3-auld-1.jpg?itok=6c1gWAAn\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>16</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9805/tour-de-france-stage-3-gallery\">Tour de France Stage 3 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>29 Jun 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9805%2Ftour-de-france-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%20Stage%203%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9805%2Ftour-de-france-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%20Stage%203%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9805%2Ftour-de-france-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%20Stage%203%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9805%2Ftour-de-france-stage-3-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9805/tour-de-france-stage-3-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 16</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/06/tdf-stage3-auld-1.jpg?itok=6c1gWAAn\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6733bba86363b38811ed8e9ef3f51f7f95d6b9862ce370e306c1bef6760c847d","category":"Cycling"}
