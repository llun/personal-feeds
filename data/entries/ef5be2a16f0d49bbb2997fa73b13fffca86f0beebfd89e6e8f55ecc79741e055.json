Smooth on the inside, they feel like the ultimate in friction-free, lightweight design.</p>\n<p>Stretch panels in the side waist allow the shorts to be pulled up easily, and there’s an elastic belt to tune the fit.  The quality of the construction and the slim cut mean they don’t flap and there’s no excess material to snag.</p>\n<p>The back is high, and the superb tailoring means the Slabs follow your shape and movement while riding.

But, mountain biking is a broad category, bringing together a wide variety of types and styles of riding and, as a result, there are a wide variety of shorts available too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/mountain-bike-shorts/\">Mountain bike shorts</a> vary from protective garments that come well over the knee to lightweight shorts that have a relatively short inseam. Some have liners with pads while others are just shells.</p>\n<p>Many mountain shorts are styled baggy but this doesn’t mean they aren’t technical items, and will often still help shed rain and wick away sweat.</p>\n<p>This guide will take you through the key things to keep in mind when looking for a pair of shorts and many of their features. We have put together a glossary too to help explain some of the more technical terms you might come across.</p>\n<h3>Fit and fabric</h3>\n<p>When it comes to mountain bike shorts, fit and fabric are the two guiding principles that will help you find a set of shorts suited to you and your needs.</p>\n<h4>Fit</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Waist adjusters on mountain bike shorts help tune the fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p>Regardless of how many features your shorts have, if they don’t fit correctly they’ll never be worth the outlay. This is why we recommend always trying shorts on.</p>\n<p>The waistband is the foundation of any mountain bike shorts construction because unlike the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-shorts/\">best cycling shorts</a> for road cycling, mountain bike shorts don’t tend to rely on bib straps to hold the shorts up.</p>\n<p>The best examples often look very low on the front when laid flat. This is because they are designed not to cut into your waist when you’re on the bike but are high enough at the back not to fall down when you’re riding.</p>\n<p>Velcro adjustment tabs on the waist are a common way to tune the fit. Look for elasticated versions of these tabs as they will help the shorts move with you and keep you comfortable as a result.</p>\n<p>Some shorts now have elasticated “grown-on-waists” which work just as well as traditional fly and popper closure designs.</p>\n<p>More traditional, and less obviously cycling short designs, often have belt loops too.</p>\n<h4>Fabric</h4>\n<p>Are you an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro racer</a> or do you ride a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/top-5-2021-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bike</a>? Do you like to ride fast and clock up the miles or is downhill more your thing?</p>\n<p>Fabric will often determine what type of riding a pair of shorts is most suitable for because it provides protection and comfort.</p>\n<p>If you’re into gravity riding, look for shorts with more heavy-duty fabrics and abrasion-resistant materials that will cope with spills.</p>\n<p>If cross-country is more your thing – or you’re just less likely to be heading downhill at warp speeds – then lightweight and stretchy fabrics are advisable because they’ll help the shorts move with you and not be cumbersome to pedal.</p>\n<p>Enduro riders will need something in between, and it is good to look for robust fabrics that have ventilation to balance protection on descents with not overheating on uphill sections.</p>\n<h3>Details to look for in mountain bike shorts</h3>\n<h4>High-backed waist</h4>\n<p>When a pair of shorts is laid flat, the rear of the waist should be clearly visible above the front to ensure it’ll sit high enough to keep your backside covered while you’re riding.</p>\n<h4>Perforations</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Perforations help improve airflow.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Placed strategically through the shorts, these little holes in the material aid airflow and are especially useful in summer, when you want to maintain coverage but not overheat.</p>\n<h4>Elastic adjustment</h4>\n<p>Shorts that have stretchy fabric incorporated into the waist adjustment enable you to get a good balance between comfort and fit that isn’t restrictive across the stomach.</p>\n<h4>Long zip pulls</h4>\n<p>Often overlooked but essential if you always ride with full-finger <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-gloves/\">mountain bike gloves</a> or for days when the chill has reached your fingers.</p>\n<h4>Pockets</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Good pocket placement is key.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Shorts come with all types and sizes of pocket, or none, so decide what you need. Do you use a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hydration-packs/\">hydration pack</a> with storage or are you reliant on your shorts to carry what you need? Do you like to carry your smartphone close to hand or just need a small zipped pocket for a key and card?</p>\n<h4>Liner</h4>\n<p>Some mountain bike shorts are just the exterior shell, and others come with liners that improve comfort. If serious distance is your aim, go for the best you can afford – buying separately if necessary. It’s essential that a liner sits snugly against your body to avoid chaffing.</p>\n<h4>DWR coating</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Traverse Shorts have an impressive DWR coating.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>DWR (durable water repellancy) coatings on fabrics will help you stay drier for longer, and it’s a good shout to look out for shorts with this feature if you’re riding anywhere wet or muddy. Over time, the DWR coating may need renewing as the effectiveness of the DWR may decrease over time due to use and going through the washing machine.</p>\n<h2>Mountain bike shorts glossary</h2>\n<h3>Ultrasonic seams</h3>\n<p>Also known as welded seams, this process fuses seams together rather than stitching them. It reduces weight and bulk, helps maintain stretch from one panel to another and removes the potential of chafing from stitched seams.</p>\n<h3>Rise</h3>\n<p>The length from the front of the waist to the crotch seam. Too high a rise and there’ll be excess fabric at the front of the shorts, which will potentially catch on the nose of your saddle.</p>\n<h3>Grown-on-waist</h3>\n<p>Rather than a separate waistband, a grown-on waist has no band, instead, the fabric is cut and shaped to the body of the shorts. This removes bulk and increases comfort as there’s no band to dig into your stomach.</p>\n<h3>Dropped knee</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dropped knees will help cover knee pads more than other shorts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr</i></span></div>\n<p>A construction method with the leg cut higher behind the knee and dropping down lower at the front. This maintains protection over the knee while reducing bulk behind it for better pedalling comfort. It also prevents a gap if you’re wearing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-knee-pads/\">knee pads</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gripper</h3>\n<p>A raised silicone or sticky print, usually applied to the rear of the waist to stop baggy shorts from slipping down over the smooth surface of a liner short. This means you don’t need a liner with dedicated fastenings for a particular pair of shorts.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ef5be2a16f0d49bbb2997fa73b13fffca86f0beebfd89e6e8f55ecc79741e055","category":"Cycling"}
