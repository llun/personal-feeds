Though, to be clear, all of the rates here—even the relatively high ones—are actually very low.</p>\n<p>Still, data on this possible side effect is accumulating at a precarious time for the country’s vaccination efforts. The Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/fda-authorizes-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-for-12-to-15-year-olds/\">authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use in adolescents 12 to 15 years old</a> just last month. So far, CDC data suggests those ages 12 to 17 have the highest rates of myocarditis cases by vaccine doses given. And the FDA is poised to review vaccine authorizations for even younger age groups in the coming months.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776140#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1776140&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77de7f52590b6ad1011a2d18d7c89ed0dfe97033996d279ad7d0501daa307198","category":"Tech"}
