It is due to be followed in short order by spacecraft from China and the United States over the next 10 days after these missions all launched from Earth last summer.</p>\n<p>The UAE spacecraft, built in conjunction with several US-based universities, successfully completed a maneuver to enter Mars' orbit on Tuesday, firing its six Delta-V thrusters for 27 minutes. This significantly slowed the spacecraft from 121,000km/hour to about 18,000km/hour, allowing it to become captured into a Mars' orbit.</p>\n\n<p>Some weeks remain while the spacecraft will test out its scientific instruments and then enter into a final \"science\" orbit. Once there, it will collect data about weather on the red planet for an entire Martian year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740840#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740840&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"709eacd6ad3ccfe6abc16dd28de5a017db71b0842fd3978ab0f1b34c927207d3","category":"Tech"}
