With a huge list of different maintenance tasks to perform it means that not every day is equal in the workshop.</p>\n<p>Here at BikeRadar we had a word with our ex full-time mechanic, Jonny Ashelford, on the things that really yank his crank. With that in mind, here are eight ways to stress out your local mechanic.</p>\n<h2>1. Bringing in a filthy bike</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Nope, we wouldn’t want to work on it either.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The last thing a mechanic needs is to be covered in road grime, mud or even worse… a top tube that’s still soggy with sweat. Some folk really do need to learn <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/clean-your-bike-in-7-simple-steps/\" target=\"_blank\">how to clean a bike</a>.</p>\n<h2>2. Anything that involves internal cable routing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> But it looks so pretty…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Yep, it might look slightly better but it’s a lot of time and effort for something that offers no real mechanical advantage. A real pet hate of Jonny’s is the recent generation of disc-equipped road bikes with hoses that route through the fork.</p>\n<h2>3. Press-fit bottom brackets</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Press-fit, where creaking is the norm.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We tried to press (ahem) Jonny further on this topic, but feared he’d get too upset. For an epic rant on press-fit bottom brackets refer back to this brilliant piece, <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/angryasian-ive-had-it-with-press-fit-bottom-brackets-38220/\" target=\"_blank\">I’ve had it with press-fit bottom brackets</a>, from BikeRadar’s former technical editor James Huang.</p>\n<h2> 4. Chainstay mounted brakes</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Good in the wind tunnel, bad in the workshop.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A nightmare to access and set up, these aero-friendly stoppers sure aren’t a mechanic’s best friend.</p>\n<h2>5. Tyre and rim combinations that just refuse to cooperate</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Not all tyres and rims get along, particularly when it comes to tubeless.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Fact: some rims and tyres simply don’t go together well and others refuse to work at all, and that’s before we add the new-school element of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless tyres</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. TT Bikes in general</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TT bikes: not a Friday afternoon job.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>From fiddly fairings to the time-consuming assembly of aero bars and the aforementioned chainstay-mounted brakes, the time-trial bike is not a Friday afternoon task.</p>\n<h2>7. Asking to borrow their tools</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Have you seen the 5mm?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This one’s for those who are lucky enough to work alongside a mechanic. Should you be fortunate to gain access to a mechanic’s toolbox, you best make sure you put anything you borrow back where you found it.</p>\n<h2>8. “Can you just…”</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Better leave him to it.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The phrase that precedes a task that’s considered both quick and easy… but it never is.</p>\n<p><em>Are you a mechanic?
