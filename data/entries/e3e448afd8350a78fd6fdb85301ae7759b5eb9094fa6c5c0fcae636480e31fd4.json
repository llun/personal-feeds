Sidi&#8217;s latest limited edition shoes look back at the era and inject some color into their lineup. Using the Sixty road shoe platform, these Multicolor Shoes really stand out from Sidi&#8217;s normal monotone look, which is why they are so unique. Information such as pricing and availability is scarce at the moment with some online retailers pricing these at £350.00.
