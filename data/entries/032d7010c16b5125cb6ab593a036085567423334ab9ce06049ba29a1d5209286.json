The spike represents an acceleration in growth that the same Microsoft researchers saw throughout last year.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/web-shell-yoy.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/web-shell-yoy-640x321.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/web-shell-yoy-1280x641.jpg 2x\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/web-shell-yoy.jpg\" class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> (credit: Microsoft)</p></div>\n<h2>A Swiss Army knife for hackers</h2>\n<p>The growth is a sign of just how useful and hard to detect these simple programs can be. A Web shell is an interface that allows hackers to execute standard commands on Web servers once the servers have been compromised. Web shells are built using Web-based programming languages such as PHP, JSP, or ASP. The command interfaces work much the way browsers do.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741731#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741731&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"032d7010c16b5125cb6ab593a036085567423334ab9ce06049ba29a1d5209286","category":"Tech"}
