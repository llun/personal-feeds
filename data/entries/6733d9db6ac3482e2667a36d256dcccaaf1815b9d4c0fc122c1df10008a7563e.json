Independent Distributors of Electronics Association (IDEA) founder Steve Calabria <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-global-chip-shortage-is-creating-a-new-problem-more-fake-components-as-fraudsters-cash-in/\">believes</a> this two-fisted squeeze will spawn a surge in counterfeit electronics, with consequences for longevity and reliability of equipment built with substandard components.</p>\n<h2>Supply, demand, and counterfeit</h2>\n<p>Pandemic lockdowns in industrial cities have pinched supply of both finished goods and raw materials, while demand for electronic products has skyrocketed due to both the need for remote work/school gear and simple boredom from people unable to travel, dine out, and party in the ways they're accustomed to.</p>\n<p>The immediate impact of this shortage is obvious and already well-reported—for example, it's so difficult to buy a graphics card right now that manufacturer MSI is bringing <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-gt-730-re-release-gpu-shortage/\">back</a> the 2014-era Nvidia GT 730. The GT 730 is, frankly, garbage—it offers a bit more than <a href=\"https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare/GeForce-GT-730-vs-Intel-UHD-630-vs-GeForce-GTX-950/2906vs3826vs3295\">half</a> the performance of Intel's UHD integrated graphics and less than a fifth the performance of 2015's GTX 950. But it <em>works</em>—and for the moment, that's the most important thing to be said about it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773176#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773176&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6733d9db6ac3482e2667a36d256dcccaaf1815b9d4c0fc122c1df10008a7563e","category":"Tech"}
