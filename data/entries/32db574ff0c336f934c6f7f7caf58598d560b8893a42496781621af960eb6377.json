That led us to wonder: can today's streaming-only BlizzCon showcase of games and plans show that the company's recent hires and behind-the-scenes reshuffling are paying off?</p>\n<p>In at least one respect, the outlook is optimistic, thanks to an impressive reveal of <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>. This long-rumored remake includes everything from both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/16-years-later-blizzard-is-still-patching-diablo-ii/\">the base 2000 game</a> and its 2001 expansion, <em>Lord of Destruction</em>. At first glimpse, this top-to-bottom remake seems to get everything right that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/\"><em>WarCraft III: Reforged</em></a> got so very, very wrong—and we won't have to wait very long to come up with our own impressions. Sign-ups for <em>D2:R</em>'s technical alpha are <a href=\"https://diablo2.blizzard.com/\">now live</a> ahead of the game's launch on PC and consoles \"in 2021.\"</p>\n<h2>The right balance between preservation and polish?</h2>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-1838-980x551.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Old graphics.
