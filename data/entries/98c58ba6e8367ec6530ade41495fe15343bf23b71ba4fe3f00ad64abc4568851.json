The Medan-based Kimia Farma employees were allegedly washing and repacking cotton swabs for the tests while pocketing up to 1.8 billion rupiah (~$125,000), local police said.</p>\n<p>Airline passengers in Indonesia are required to present a negative COVID-19 test result before boarding, and many opt for the convenience of being tested at the airport. Since the alleged swab scam began in December, Kimia Farma workers were testing between 100 and 200 passengers a day at the airport, some with fresh tests and others with tests that apparently involved reused swabs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763266#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763266&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98c58ba6e8367ec6530ade41495fe15343bf23b71ba4fe3f00ad64abc4568851","category":"Tech"}
