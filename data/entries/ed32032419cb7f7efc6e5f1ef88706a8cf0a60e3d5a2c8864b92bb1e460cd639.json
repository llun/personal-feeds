But in 2020, Chrome OS became the second-most popular OS, and Apple fell to third.</p>\n<p>That's according to numbers from market data firm IDC and a <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2021/chromebooks-outsold-macs-worldwide-2020-cutting-windows-market-share/\">report</a> on IDC's data by publication GeekWire. Chrome OS had passed macOS briefly in individual quarters before, but 2020 was the first full year when Apple's OS took third place.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that macOS landed in third, viewing this as an example of Google beating out Apple directly might not be accurate. Rather, it's likely that Chrome OS has been primarily pulling sales and market share away from Windows at the low end of the market. Mac market share actually grew from 6.7 percent in 2019 to 7.5 percent in 2020.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743030#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743030&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed32032419cb7f7efc6e5f1ef88706a8cf0a60e3d5a2c8864b92bb1e460cd639","category":"Tech"}
