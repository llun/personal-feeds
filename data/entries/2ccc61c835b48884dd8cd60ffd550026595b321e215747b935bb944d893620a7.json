The CMA defines \"mobile ecosystems\" as \"gateways through which consumers can access a variety of products, content and services,\" meaning that the investigation will cover a range of services and products, from fitness tracking to smart home devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe CMA says that consumers could be \"losing out across a wide range of areas\" as a result of the purported duopoly, leading to \"reduced innovation\" and \"consumers paying higher prices.\" The investigation will also examine the effect of the companies' market power on other businesses, such as app developers and advertisers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe CMA was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/uk-watchdog-apple-investigation/\">already investigating</a> Apple's ‌App Store‌ policies, but this investigation into mobile ecosystems is set to be broader. Even so, the CMA will present a joined-up approach across all of its related cases. Market investigations can make recommendations to the government or other bodies in the UK, issue guidance to businesses and consumers, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe UK is also in the process of establishing a new \"pro-competition\" regulatory authority for digital markets called the Digital Markets Unit. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYesterday, the <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/06/13/business/apple-google-antitrust/\"><em>Japan Times</em></a> reported that there will be a similar investigation starting this month into Apple and Google's duopoly in Japan, which could result in increased antitrust regulations.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/apple-and-google-duopoly-scrutiny-uk/\">Apple and Google 'Duopoly' to Come Under Scrutiny in the UK</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-google-duopoly-to-come-under-scrutiny-in-the-uk.2300988/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RQITXlKldMc:6yhhJa98gqk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RQITXlKldMc:6yhhJa98gqk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RQITXlKldMc\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ccc61c835b48884dd8cd60ffd550026595b321e215747b935bb944d893620a7","category":"Apple"}
