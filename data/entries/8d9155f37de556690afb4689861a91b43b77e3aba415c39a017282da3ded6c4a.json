DID THEY MIGRATE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN AND ON TO THE GREAT LAKES OF MICHIGAN? DO THEY WALK AMONG US? ARE THEY MORE ADVANCED THAN US, AND WHY DO THEY MAKE THEIR STRANGE MUSIC? WHAT IS THEIR QUEST?”</p>\n<p>With those all-caps words, musician and writer James Stinson wrote the constitution for the mythic, rhythmic nation of <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/artist/1172-Drexciya\">Drexciya</a>—a world that he and partner Gerald Donald created in the liner notes of their experimental music project. Their combined work, in the form of five EPs of cutting-edge techno music, did not necessarily <em>sound</em> so politically or culturally charged. Because Stinson and Donald did not participate in interviews or widely tour in support of their albums, Drexciya's listeners were left to look at the stories and questions that covered the liner notes and artwork printed on the releases' vinyl and CD versions.</p>\n<p>Should you merely pull up Drexciya on your favorite streaming service, you won't hear those messages in the beats. So to understand this innovative group, it's crucial to ask the above questions about the fictional Drexciyan quest. And in asking them, Stinson blurred a line between fiction and Black reality—and spoke to a quest of his own.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743849#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743849&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d9155f37de556690afb4689861a91b43b77e3aba415c39a017282da3ded6c4a","category":"Tech"}
