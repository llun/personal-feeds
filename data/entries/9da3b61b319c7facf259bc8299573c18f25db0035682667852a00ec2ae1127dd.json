Still, it was fantastic to see a total of 31 riders on the start sheet.</p>\n<p>It’s a great relief to see some sunshine today though, as we barrel towards another weekend (although the forecast for Saturday and Sunday is looking pretty abysmal too – it could be a good weekend for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/zwift-group-rides/\">Zwift group ride</a>, if you don’t like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-cycling-kit-for-riding-in-the-rain/\">riding in the rain</a>).</p>\n<p>But, before we down tools for a break, let’s take a look back at another week on BikeRadar.</p>\n<p>On the subject of time trials, Canyon announced its latest UCI-legal time trial bike, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-speedmax-cfr-disc-tt/\">Speedmax CFR Disc TT</a>. It’s a great looking bike and no doubt super-fast, but with only one £10,799 / €9,999 build available, I doubt I’ll be seeing too many popping up at local time trials any time soon. This one’s more for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour</a> pros.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/giro-ditalia/\">Giro d’Italia</a> starting tomorrow, EF Education-Nippo unveiled its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-rapha-giro-kit/\">latest limited-edition team kit</a>. Dubbed ‘Euphoria’ and made by the team’s clothing sponsor <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/rapha/\">Rapha</a>, it’s designed to “celebrate people from different nations and backgrounds coming together in pursuit of a common goal”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/colnago/\">Colnago</a> also announced that it is auctioning off an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/colnago-nft-auction/\">NFT artwork</a> of its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/colnago-c64-disc-gallery/\">C64 road bike</a> and other iconic Colnago bikes. The starting price for this digital artwork – which, it’s worth remembering, can be viewed by anyone for free – is €5,515. What are you actually buying then? I’m not entirely sure. Apparently, it’s ownership rights to the digital artwork… I’m happy to admit I don’t have a clue what’s going on here or why anyone would want to spend real money on something like this.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t yet spent all your money on digital artwork of a bike, you could instead buy the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/lapierre-aircode-drs-8-0-review/\">Lapierre Aircode DRS 8.0</a>. Our senior technical editor for road, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/warrenrossier/\">Warren Rossiter</a>, published his review of it this week and awarded it a close to perfect score of 4.5. Its RRP is almost a thousand Euros more than the starting price for a Colnago NFT, but then you can actually ride this bike, so arguably it represents slightly better value.</p>\n<p>And, with that out of the way, let’s jump into some of the latest tech to land with us this week.</p>\n\n<h2>Vittoria Air-Liner tubeless tyre kit</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><p>The clincher vs <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pirelli-p-zero-race-sl-tubular-tyres/\">tubular</a> debate still rages on in road cycling, with no one seemingly able to agree on what the best system is.</p>\n<p>The reality is that there is no ‘best’ solution for every bike and every rider – it depends on your personal choice, riding style and goals – but it’s undoubtedly tubeless tyre tech that’s seeing the majority of the development money thrown at it.</p>\n<p>This latest innovation from Vittoria is a foam insert kit that offers a run-flat solution for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">tubeless road tyres</a>. Tubular tyre proponents have long touted the ability of a tubular to stay attached to the rim in the event of a puncture – both critical for safety and helping to avoid time losses in races – which tubeless tyres couldn’t do, until now, perhaps.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Vittoria’s Air-Liner Road kit is a run flat solution for road tubeless tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Essentially a smaller version of its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/vittoria-rolls-out-air-liner-tire-inserts/\">MTB Air-Liner tyre insert</a>, the road version is available in sizes to fit 700 x 25mm, 700 x 28mm and 700 x 30mm tubeless tyres. The 700 x 25mm inserts I have for testing weigh 21g each and, according to Vittoria, don’t contribute to any extra rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>I will admit to being slightly sceptical of that claim, though – adding any extra material to a tyre system is typically going to add a small amount of rolling resistance (even if the penalty is likely to be tiny in this case).</p>\n<p>The kit includes a set of burly tyre pliers, indicating the inserts are going to make installing the tubeless tyres much harder. It’s for this reason I see these as a run-flat protection option for racing rather than day-to-day use. Unless you’re willing to carry the pliers with you on a normal ride, you might not have much luck trying to fix a big puncture by the side of the road.</p>\n<ul><li>RRP £64.99 / $82.99 / €77.49</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2><em>Start at the End: How Reverse-Engineering Can Lead to Success</em> by Dan Bigham</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><p>Dan Bigham of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/anemoi-aero-extension-system/\">Wattshop</a> and the Ribble Weldtite Pro Cycling team has made quite a splash in cycling in recent years.</p>\n<p>Starting as an outsider on the British track cycling scene, he and a group of friends took on the Great Britain squad and overcame the enormous funding gap to win a national team pursuit title.</p>\n<p>From there, he’s gone from strength to strength, racing track World Cups and working with some of the top professional teams and riders in the sport.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dan Bigham’s new book is about the process of reverse engineering.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bigham’s new book, <em>Start at the End: How Reverse-Engineering Can Lead to Success</em>, charts both Bigham’s rise to fame/notoriety and sets out his philosophy for achieving success against the odds.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a how-to guide for aerodynamic positioning, training or bike shopping.
