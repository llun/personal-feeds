As the young Dane rolled under the Flamme Rouge, it was written on paper that he would finish second at the <a href=\"/tags/tour-of-flanders\">Tour of Flanders</a> for the second time in his short career.</p>\n<p>He was never going to beat defending champion <a href=\"/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> in a straight drag race. The Dutchman's Ferrari like acceleration is unmatched by almost all in the peloton, not least that of the churning Volvo-like engine that is rooted deep inside the legs and lungs of Asgreen.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n          </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>So when the duo, after 254.2km of racing across 19 Heiligen, began to wind up the gears with just 250m until the finish line, we as spectators could almost look away from the television, expecting a foregone conclusion as obvious as a Hollywood blockbuster.  </p>\n<p>But this is professional sport, not Hollywood. Scripts are there to be torn up, upsets are there to be had and my, was this an upset.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/7898/cervelo-aspero-review\">Cervélo Áspero review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/sram/9405/sram-rival-etap-axs\">Sram Rival eTap AXS: bringing wireless electronic shifting to the masses</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/7978/faster-always-faster-the-story-of-cervelo\">The history of Cervélo bikes</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/cannondalecomp\">Competition: Win a Cannondale SuperSix Evo Neo 2 e-bike</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nNobody believed Asgreen could outsprint Van der Poel but here we are, he did. And now he has earned himself a plane in the annals of history. The second Dane to win De Ronde, the ninth to double up with victory at E3 Harelbeke earlier in the Spring. Not bad for a rider who was only signed by Patrick Lefevere and Deceuninck-Quickstep midway through 2018 as injury cover.</p>\n<p>Below is a selection of images from this memorable of the men's Tour of Flanders from the excellent Chris Auld.
