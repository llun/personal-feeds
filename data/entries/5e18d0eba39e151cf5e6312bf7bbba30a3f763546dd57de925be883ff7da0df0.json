Dowd,\na former IBM X-Force researcher whom one peer called “the Mozart\nof exploit design,” had found one in open-source code from Mozilla\nthat Apple used to permit accessories to be plugged into an\niPhone’s lightning port, according to the person. […]</p>\n\n<p>Using the flaw Dowd found, Wang, based in Portland, Ore., created\nan exploit that enabled initial access to the phone — a foot in the\ndoor. Then he hitched it to another exploit that permitted greater\nmaneuverability, according to the people. And then he linked that\nto a final exploit that another Azimuth researcher had already\ncreated for iPhones, giving him full control over the phone’s core\nprocessor the brains of the device. From there, he wrote software\nthat rapidly tried all combinations of the passcode, bypassing\nother features, such as the one that erased data after 10\nincorrect tries. […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the “Where Are They Now?” department:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple sought to recruit Wang to work on security research,\naccording to the people. Instead, in 2017 he co-founded\n<a href=\"https://corellium.com/security-research\">Corellium</a>, a company\nbased in South Florida whose tools help security researchers. The\ntools allow researchers to run tests on Apple’s mobile operating\nsystem using “virtual” iPhones. The virtual phones run on a server\nand display on a desktop computer.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, Apple <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/apple-sues-virtual-iphone-vendor-that-helps-hackers-find-ios-bugs/\">sued\nCorellium</a>\nfor copyright violation. As part of the lawsuit, Apple pressed\nCorellium and Wang to divulge information about hacking techniques\nthat may have aided governments and agencies such as the FBI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-5c\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5e18d0eba39e151cf5e6312bf7bbba30a3f763546dd57de925be883ff7da0df0","category":"Tech"}
