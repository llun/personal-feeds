And I would like to calmly\nsuggest that now is the time we should consider no longer wearing\nmasks when we walk around outside.</p>\n\n<p>I am not suggesting this simply because I am very sick of\nwearing a mask at all times outside my home. When it comes to\ncoronavirus spread, evidence shows that being outdoors is very,\nvery safe. […]</p>\n\n<p>While it’s important to mask in outdoor crowds or if you’re\nhanging out <em>close</em> to someone in a park, Chagla explains, the\nmain message should be that the outdoors is a safe place to be. He\ngave me a rough sense of how unlikely outdoor transmission is in\nthe scenario where you’re walking unmasked on the sidewalk and\nbriefly pass someone. First, you or the person you’re passing\nwould have to happen to have an asymptomatic infection, he\nexplained, and <em>then</em> everyone would have to be exhaling and\ninhaling at <em>just</em> the right moment, and also, exchanging <em>enough</em>\nparticles to actually seed another infection: “You’re talking\nabout a probability of getting hit by a car, and being struck by\nlightning.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this too soon? I think scientifically, eschewing masks outdoors except for close conversations is perfectly safe. The evidence is overwhelming that COVID spreads almost entirely indoors, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext\">through the air</a>. But socially, I’m not sure. Until overall infection rates start dropping as more people are vaccinated, there are social benefits to the “mask up” mantra.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/18/face-masks-outside\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6ed318362163f6ac3c5d2bba4341dd835bbb56eb76b89575fb48bbde5722146d","category":"Tech"}
