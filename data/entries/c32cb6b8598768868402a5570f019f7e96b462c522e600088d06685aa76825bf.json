Rémi Cavagna took the stage 5 victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders took on a 16.2 km course in Fribourg, Switzerland that featured an early cobbled climb. Stefan Bissegger powered to an early provisional lead on the stage with a time of 22:00. Cavanga, however, was 17 seconds faster at the intermediate time check, and he rode well enough in the latter part of the course to set a final mark six seconds faster than Bissegger’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GC contenders were the last riders to take to the course, with Thomas the penultimate rider rolling down the ramp in the hopes of unseating overnight leader Mike Woods, who had taken the GC lead after Thomas crashed in the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/tour-de-romandie-woods-wins-stage-4-and-takes-the-lead-as-thomas-crashes-in-the-finale/\" target=\"_blank\">finale of stage 4</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That crash did not seem to affect Thomas on Sunday, as he cruised through the course in a time of 22:11 to finish third on the stage behind Cavagna and Bissegger. Woods set a mark of 23:05, only good enough for 28th on the day, dropping down off the GC podium. Thomas took the overall victory with a 28-second gap to his Ineos Grenadiers teammate Richie Porte, who claimed runner-up honors while Fausto Masnada rounded out the overall podium.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Tour de Romandie (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>Fribourg → Fribourg</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255765\">Full results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                    <div>\n                                <div>\n                                    <span>1</span>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <a href=\"#\">CAVAGNA Rémi</a>\n                                        <span>Deceuninck -
