Based on comments from affected users, it appears that the issue may be more common when connecting displays via HDMI compared to Thunderbolt.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple did not provide a specific timeframe for a fix. The memo was issued on February 19, over a week after the release of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-2-1/\">macOS Big Sur 11.2.1</a>, which does not appear to address the issue. It is possible that a fix could be readied in time for the release of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/apple-seeds-macos-big-sur-11-3-beta-1/\">macOS Big Sur 11.3</a>, which has been in beta testing since February 2.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the meantime, Apple outlined the following troubleshooting steps:<ul><li>Put the Mac mini to sleep</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Wait two minutes and wake the Mac mini</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Unplug the display from the Mac mini, and then plug the display back in</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Adjust the display's resolution in System Preferences > Displays</li></ul>If the issue reoccurs after restarting the Mac mini, Apple says to repeat the steps above.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere have been various other external display issues with M1 Macs in recent months, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/macos-big-sur-external-display-issues/\">USB-C connection issues</a> to some resolutions being unavailable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/23/apple-to-fix-ultrawide-display-m1-mac-issue/\">when using an ultrawide or super-ultrawide display</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/\">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/pink-squares-external-display-m1-mac-mini/\">Apple Investigating Issue With &#039;Pink Squares&#039; Appearing on Displays Connected to M1 Mac Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-investigating-issue-with-pink-squares-appearing-on-displays-connected-to-m1-mac-mini.2285656/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=45PJ0yKWJDs:E3S3oGNG1zc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=45PJ0yKWJDs:E3S3oGNG1zc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/45PJ0yKWJDs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"345f184f20028257f60e2572478b6f36e4f9dc1e60e913b6462dfe153b175554","category":"Apple"}
