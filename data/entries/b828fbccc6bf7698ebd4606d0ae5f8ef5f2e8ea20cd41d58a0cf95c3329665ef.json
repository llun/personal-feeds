In Slovenia, where peaks are always on the horizon, his mother, Marjeta</span><span>,</span><span> hails from the village of Gora, which means mountain in their native tongue, </span><span>while</span><span> his father Mirko’s </span><span>birthplace</span><span> of Klanec</span><span>, </span><span>stands for hill.</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><span>The two met through Marjeta’s brother, married and settled in the town of Komenda, 20 kilometres north of Slovenia’s capital, Ljubljana. The third of their four kids, Tadej</span><span>, arrived</span><span> in September 1998, often following the lead of older siblings Tilen and Barbara in their games and Lego sessions. “When he was a child and felt that something went wrong in the family, he tried to cheer us up,” Marjeta adds. “He played the clown and made us laugh. Every time he needed there to be no tension in the family. He tried to break it with singing or dancing. He’s stayed that way.” The wider cycling world hasn’t seen this side of Pogačar, apart from a brief pandemic rap last year. (Let’s just say Jay-Z has nothing to worry about.)</span></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\">Related: Tour de France 2021 Preview</a></em></p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/IMG_20201122_190839-_1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623844255\" />His childhood was spent outdoors, kicking a football around, going on long family walks in the local hills on Sundays or playing in the meadow at the back of their house. It wouldn’t be a parental chat without a few unexpected revelations either.</span><span> </span><span>“Tadej and Tilen were very good at unicycling,” his mother says. “Like clowns in the circus. They were famous around here, many people watched and admired when they came by.” Unfortunately, the family’s two unicycles were stolen, which put an abrupt end to </span><span>life on one wheel</span><span>. </span></span></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/i-just-love-to-race-tadej-pogacar-on-winning-the-tour-at-22-and-what-the-future-holds\">Related: \"I just love to race\" Tadej Pogačar on winning the Tour at 22 and what the future holds</a></em></p>\n<p><span>That loss has been professional cycling’s gain. Following Tilen to the Rog Ljubljana club, the nine-year-old Tadej quickly proved adept on two wheels.</span><span> An</span><span> obsession was born, egged on by the exploits of his favourite riders, Alberto Contador and the Schleck brothers. At school one day, as he stared out of the window, not paying attention, a teacher asked Pogačar what he was thinking. “The training route I’ll take this afternoon,” he replied.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>Pogačar spoke to Prologo about his past in cycling and the emotion of his Tour win</em></p>\n<p><span>The Pogačars wanted their children to have a strong work ethic and moral grounding. “We tried to teach them to be honest, hardworking and kind to other people,” Marjeta says. Their belief was that children doing activities and growing up as part of a group would become happy, well-adjusted adults. “And when they sometimes wanted to quit [a sport or pursuit] during the season, we didn’t allow them. We wanted them to finish the work they started,” Marjeta says. <span>This is a family with principles, as their visit to last year’s Tour de France indicates. They took up the Slovenian cycling federation’s offer of flights to Paris to see Tadej on the podium. When it transpired, 24 hours before the finish, that he was set to win the whole thing, the president of Slovenia asked them to go by private jet. Who could say no to that? The Pogačars: they had already given their word, so they boarded a low-cost Croatian Airlines flight and beamed with pride at the finish. Then they had to get back home for work: Marjeta is a school French teacher, while Mirko was head of production at a chair factory before becoming a manager of Pogačar’s former cycling team at the start of 2021.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><strong>This is an extract from our Tour de France edition, out now and available to buy <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/collections/rouleur-magazine/products/issue-104-tour-de-france?variant=39982132068519\">here</a></strong><br /></span></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"b828fbccc6bf7698ebd4606d0ae5f8ef5f2e8ea20cd41d58a0cf95c3329665ef","category":"Cycling"}
