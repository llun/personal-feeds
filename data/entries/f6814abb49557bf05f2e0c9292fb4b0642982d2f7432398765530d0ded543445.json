I just set the tracking speed to slow and it's feels good to me.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRotate to seek doesn't work, at least right out of the box... Does it need to be enabled? Maybe I haven't really understood how to use it... As a good ol' click wheel as on the iPods, right? It just recognizes my input as swiping on the trackpad.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe buttons feel a bit clicky, but still solid.</blockquote>As for the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K itself, the interface runs smoothly and installing apps is quick, but the Reddit user did not have a prior-generation for comparison.<blockquote>Nothing to complain. Runs smooth on every corner and installing apps is so quick it's ridiculous. Can't really compare to the older Apple TVs, since that this is my first ‌Apple TV‌... But smoother than my Sony Android TV software, that's for sure.</blockquote>Customers who purchased an ‌Apple TV‌ 4K with ‌Siri‌ Remote from Apple will start seeing deliveries on May 21, with customers in Australia and New Zealand set to receive their devices first, so we should soon be hearing additional opinions on the redesigned ‌Siri‌ Remote and the speed improvements introduced with the A12 Bionic chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple TV‌ 4K orders have started <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/new-apple-tv-4k-begins-shipping/\">shipping in Canada</a>, though we have yet to hear from any U.S. customers that have shipping notices at this time.
