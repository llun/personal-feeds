family.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>And if this virus has given us anything, it’s the appreciation for just staying local, enjoying more time outside with family and friends and living life<span id=\"more-36081\"></span> at a more relaxed pace.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Good for us all it seems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>At the same time, we still have that itch to get out and explore, and doing so within close proximity to home creates all kinds of options.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>With summer coming to a close and the winter not far away here in the mountains, the window was closing to knock out an epic ride just down the road in Moab, Utah – the White Rim trail, a remote 100 mile dirt tour through Canyonlands National Park. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36115 size-full\"

GRVL Co-Founder, and a friend of Moots, joined us for the adventure and we set out on October 9 for a drive to Moab, arriving just in time for a nice meal and then it was straight to the hotel to prep for the day ahead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This trail is known for being rugged and remote and planning is crucial.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>With absolutely no services along the route, exposure to the desert sun the entire day and uncertainty as to any nearby stream, you’ve got to be prepared.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter

element to consider as well and mountain bikes are the most common choice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, this seemed like the perfect ride for the <a href=\"https://moots.com/bike/baxter-29/\">BAXTER</a>, a unique bike that is sometimes overlooked, yet it is one of the favorites of a few of us at Moots.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This drop bar mountain bike is quite capable, handling tires up to 2.25” and equipped with SRAM AXS and a rigid carbon Salsa Cutthroat fork. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36114 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5805.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\"

clockwise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>From our parking area, this took us down a gentle grade gravel road for about 12 miles until we neared the edge of the White Rim, which is just amazing to see as you roll up to it coming from just a seemingly flat desert landscape.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You immediately then descend a steep switchback road right down into the Canyon floor where you near the Green River.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36118 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5815.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5815.jpeg 1500w,

this ride is through this incredible desert landscape snaking by the river, up and over cliffs, around tight bends and affords views that just seem other worldly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>You’re afforded all kinds of perspectives on the ride through this amazing landscape as you literally are in the canyon floor at times, along the canyon rim and the ride takes you on some wicked steep climbs up and down through the Canyon until we finally began the climb out via Schaeffer Trail, a brutal (after 85 miles in this desert, a speed bump was brutal) 3 mile slog gaining 1,300 feet that takes you back out to the pavement with the car only a few short miles away. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /></p>\n<p>In total, the ride was 100 miles with 7,300 feet of climbing and the dominant bikes we saw on the route were full suspension mountain bikes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>We did spy a few others on rigid drop bar bikes, who all wanted to say hello and share their excitement at seeing another drop bar friend.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>In the end though, the Baxter was perfect for this ride and the mountain bike gearing along with the dropper post for those steep and sandy descents were critical.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Given how sandy and rocky the trail was, wider tires than gravel bikes can accommodate was critical as well. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36119 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5819.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\"
