So to take full advantage of the new chip's speeds, Intel software needs to be re-written specifically for the M1 processor. Developers need time to write apps with that “native” code, however, so <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3563771/apple-details-an-impressive-aggressive-transition-to-macs-with-apple-silicon.html#toc-3\">Apple created a translation tool called Rosetta 2</a> that allows for existing Intel-based software made for Intel Macs to run on Apple silicon.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3611290/how-to-force-a-native-m1-mac-app-to-run-as-an-intel-app-instead.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7e290072c7354032885ea7709e7478de67291e795910244e8b40aa6a4e9f9e9d","category":"Apple"}
