I will go day by day. The Tour de France is a very long race and anything can happen. I hope I am in good health and that everything goes well.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is planning to ride this year’s race the way the team rode the 2017 Tour, when Urán rode to second overall and also won a stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In 2017, we never rode a defensive strategy. It was an open race, we encouraged the guys to take chances. Each day we will have someone helping Rigo, but he’s such a strategic racer that he doesn’t need an entire team dedicated to him anyways,” team CEO Jonathan Vaughters said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you take each day as an individual race, we’ve got a rider who can win that stage each day. It’s a very dynamic squad. And win in different situations. There are a lot of different opportunities. I’m excited for everyone.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/rigoberto-uran-headlines-ef-education-nippos-tour-de-france-squad/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f433dc9d9dc65e91848af5a043d604ddf23920db1aeac751e9970fa193034f6f","category":"Cycling"}
