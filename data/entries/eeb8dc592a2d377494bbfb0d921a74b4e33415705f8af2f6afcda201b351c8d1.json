It is not possible to install or start an Intel x86 based operating system in a virtual machine, and ARM32 applications do not work.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nCurrent release versions of Parallels are not able to run on &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs, so &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac owners who want to use the software will need to participate in the Technical Preview program.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/parallels/\">Parallels</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/parallels-16-m1-technical-preview-update/\">Parallels 16 for M1 Macs Gets Technical Preview 2 Update With New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/parallels-16-for-m1-macs-gets-technical-preview-2-update-with-new-features.2284954/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S9gDl_VprrY:EbjZWG2xFPI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=S9gDl_VprrY:EbjZWG2xFPI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/S9gDl_VprrY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eeb8dc592a2d377494bbfb0d921a74b4e33415705f8af2f6afcda201b351c8d1","category":"Apple"}
