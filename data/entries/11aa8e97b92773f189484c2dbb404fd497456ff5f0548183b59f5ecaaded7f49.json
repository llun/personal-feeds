The findings reference \"com.apple.NanoTips\" and \"com.Apple.NanoContacts,\" both identifiers include \"Nano,\" which is Apple's internal codename for Apple Watch apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Looks like someone deployed the new profile for ‌App Store‌ too early? Want to guess what “<a href=\"https://t.co/nhhpJFmZbJ\">https://t.co/nhhpJFmZbJ</a>.Mind” is on watchOS? <a href=\"https://t.co/BarzoJtovq\">pic.twitter.com/BarzoJtovq</a></p>— Khaos Tian (@KhaosT) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/1401294687374233600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2021</a></blockquote> \r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\nAlongside the identifiers referencing the unreleased apps for Apple Watch, Apple also posted \"com.Apple.Mind,\" an app currently not offered by the company. The lack of a specific codename, such as Nano, likely indicates that the app will be available across watchOS and iOS. Apple has in the past been rumored to be working on different health features, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/08/apple-watch-watchos-7-mental-health-capabilities/\">including mental health</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/05/ipados-15-improved-multitasking-redesigned-banner/\">has stated</a> that the next update to watchOS will include new and improved health tracking features. Apple already offers a Breathe app on Apple Watch, and the unreleased Mind app may be an expansion or replacement of the app to better suit mental health needs.
