Google Talk was Google's inaugural chat application that started in 2005 (it's often unofficially nicknamed \"GChat\"). In 2013, Google Talk got an in-place upgrade to Google Hangouts, which was (mostly) compatible with Google's OG chat service. Now, Google Hangouts users will be seamlessly upgraded to Google Chat, resulting in 16 years of turbulent-but-functional Google messaging.</p>\n<p>These days it feels like all I do is spread doom and gloom about Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/google-kills-product/\">latest shutdowns</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/09/google-allo-is-incomplete-but-assistant-is-the-companys-future/\">dead-on-arrival messaging app</a> rollouts. But know up front that Google Chat is actually pretty good! Needing to be compatible with Google Hangouts—to date, Google's best-ever messaging app—means it's also a worthy successor to Google Hangouts. This app has lots of client support, online accounts instead of the limited phone number system pushed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-new-google-pay-repeats-all-the-same-mistakes-of-google-allo/\">by Google Pay</a> and Google Allo, and a smooth transition process for your existing chats and contacts. It's not as fully featured as more stable chat systems that have been around for years, but if you're looking for the basics across tons of devices, this 1.0 version of Google Chat is truthfully not bad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773681#p3\">Read 37 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773681&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca7515b657da7cfd436db1992e84f52a8fb2a864a116d436c7d658eb6a0fcc03","category":"Tech"}
