These shots have long been dogged by doubts of their efficacy.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/05/24/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/\">a report by The Washington Post</a>, health experts in China say that protection from the vaccines may not last after six months and that people who are at high risk of COVID-19 should get a third dose. Now, state-run media outlets suggest Beijing is on board with the suggestion and is preparing to offer the third doses.</p>\n<p>Last week, both the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain said <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3133977/coronavirus-uae-offer-third-dose-recipients-chinas-sinopharm\">they would offer third doses</a> of China’s Sinopharm vaccine to try to boost protection. UAE is offering the extra shots to anyone who was vaccinated six or more months ago. Bahrain is offering third doses to high-risk groups.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767237#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767237&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9e92d1eae79d648fbb975baa24cb8be35bf8c1306f4a7afeb752cc706a2d67c6","category":"Tech"}
