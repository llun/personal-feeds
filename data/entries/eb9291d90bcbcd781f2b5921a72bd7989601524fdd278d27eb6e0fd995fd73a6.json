The publication is now shifting, explicitly stating that mass shipments for the new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> will begin in the second quarter. At the same time last week, speculation grew that Apple will hold an event on Tuesday, March 23.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThat event, yet to be confirmed, is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/march-23-apple-event-rumored-ipad-airpods-airtags/\">rumored</a> to include the launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3, and new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. If <em>DigiTimes</em> is to be believed, however, the new 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a mini-LED display will not launch until at least April.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has several products in the pipeline with mini-LED displays. Compared to regular LCDs, mini-LED offers higher brightness, improved contrast ratio, and is expected to become the new standard amongst Apple's future products, including a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/14-16-macbook-pro-mini-led-display/\">14-inch MacBook Pro</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/digitimes-12-9-ipad-pro-mini-led-q2-2021/\">DigiTimes: 12.9-Inch iPad Pro With Mini-LED Display No Longer Expected to Ship Until At Least April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/digitimes-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-with-mini-led-display-no-longer-expected-to-ship-until-at-least-april.2288604/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ezndqmBIdRc:9-ANOSZ8Sqw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ezndqmBIdRc:9-ANOSZ8Sqw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ezndqmBIdRc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"eb9291d90bcbcd781f2b5921a72bd7989601524fdd278d27eb6e0fd995fd73a6","category":"Apple"}
