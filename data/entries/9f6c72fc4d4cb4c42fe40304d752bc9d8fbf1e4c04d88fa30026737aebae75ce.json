{"title":"Review: Cozy's MagPad Adds Style and Functionality to Apple's MagSafe Charger","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/review/cozy-magpad-magsafe-charger-cover/","date":1615500172000,"content":"The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cozy-MagPad-Compatible-Accessories-Protector/dp/B08R83DX9S\">MagPad by Cozy</a> is a soft, silicone pad that's designed to fit over Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> Charger. Priced at around &#36;7, the MagPad comes in a range of colors and patterns.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/cozy-magpad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1350\" height=\"759\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787936\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nSize wise, the MagPad adds about an inch of additional space to the MagPad (in circumference), and it's about the size of a standard Qi-based wireless charger. The silicone material is textured and the bright colors are more attractive than the standard white &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; color.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/magpad-color-options.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787938\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe back of the MagPad has a cutout for the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger where it fits in tightly, with a space for routing the cord. There's a bit of a lip that fits over the MagPad to hold it in place, so it won't go anywhere when attached to a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/magpad-bottom-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787939\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe silicone surface where the MagPad covers the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger is thin, but it does weaken the magnetic connection, something that I found to be a plus. When I'm using the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger on my desk, detaching it from my <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> is a hassle.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nI tend to use a gesture where I use a thumb or my fingers to detach it and slide it off so I don't have to pick it up with my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and that's made easier with the MagPad on. I have a lot more surface area so it just takes the tips of my fingers to pull my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; up, leaving the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger in the MagPad on my desk without disturbing it.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/magsafe-charger-in-magpad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787940\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAt the same time, there's still enough of a magnetic connection that I can set my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; down and have it attach in just the right place, so the actual quick magnetic adherence isn't impacted.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you have a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Duo, the MagPad functionality is similar. It's a lot easier to detach an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Duo than from a standard &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger just because of that extra bit of material that lets you get your fingers in the right spot to pry the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; off of the charger quickly and easily.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/magpad-iphone-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787941\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger as a desk charger, the MagPad works great to make it easier to use. Cozy says that it's also able to prevent the rings that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/23/magsafe-circular-imprints-leather-cases/\">can be imprinted</a> into the Leather Cases from Apple, but I don't own a leather case to test this out. The premise makes sense, though, because the MagPad is adding a silicone layer that makes the magnetic connection weaker to lessen the force of the charger. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/magpad-magsafe-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787943\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nSomeone who uses the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger as a charging option while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is in use may not prefer the MagPad, but if you use it in multiple ways, it's worth noting that it's easy to pull off when needed. It works with a naked &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a MagSafe-compatible case.  \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you want an accessory to make the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger look better on a desk, or if you want a simple solution to make your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> model easier to pick up, the MagPad is well worth checking out. It's affordable, functional, and overall a great little add-on option to improve Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger for desktop use.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/magpad-coral-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787942\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2>How to Buy</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe MagPad can be <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cozy-MagPad-Compatible-Accessories-Protector/dp/B08R83DX9S\">purchased from Amazon</a> for &#36;6.91, with a two-pack also available for &#36;9.87.
