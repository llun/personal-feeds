That neutrino finally reached the Earth's South Pole last October, setting off detectors buried deep beneath the Antarctic ice. A few months earlier, a telescope in California had recorded a bright glow emanating from the friction of that same distant galaxy—evidence of a so-called \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event\">tidal disruption event</a>\" (TDE), most likely the result of a star being shredded by a supermassive black hole.</p>\n<p>According to two new papers (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-01295-8\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01305-3\">here</a>) published in the journal Nature Astronomy, that lone neutrino was likely born from the TDE, which serves as a cosmic-scale particle accelerator near the center of the distant galaxy, spewing out high-energy subatomic particles as the star's matter is consumed by the black hole. This finding also sheds light on the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, a question that has puzzled astronomers for decades.</p>\n<p>\"The origin of cosmic high-energy neutrinos is unknown, primarily because they are notoriously hard to pin down,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-02/nyu-sls021921.php\">said co-author Sjoert van Velzen</a>, a postdoc at New York University at the time of the discovery. \"This result would be only the second time high-energy neutrinos have been traced back to their source.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744691#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1744691&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"588e9d174adbb667afb5f9f26d80887ea17ad908f6ba520cd0f3aa17ba31ee72","category":"Tech"}
