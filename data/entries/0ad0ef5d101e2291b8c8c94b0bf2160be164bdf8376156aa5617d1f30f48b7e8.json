Windows 10 was intended to be <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-quick-start\">Windows as a Service</a>—a radical departure from the prior era of new, major Windows releases every three years or so. It seemed likely that Sun Valley's \"sweeping visual rejuvenation\" would result in Windows 10 21H2 looking very different from Windows 10 21H1. Why fix what's not broken?</p>\n<p>The first strong indication that bigger things may be coming landed last week from a Microsoft-<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro\">published</a> EOL notice for Windows 10. \"Windows 10 Home and Pro\"—no code names, no minor version numbers—is now listed as retiring on October 14, 2025. \"Retiring\" is a part of the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/policies/modern\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> and means that the retired product leaves support entirely; this does not follow the old Fixed Lifecycle Policy with \"mainstream\" and \"extended\" support. Retired is retired—hit the pasture.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773644#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773644&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ad0ef5d101e2291b8c8c94b0bf2160be164bdf8376156aa5617d1f30f48b7e8","category":"Tech"}
