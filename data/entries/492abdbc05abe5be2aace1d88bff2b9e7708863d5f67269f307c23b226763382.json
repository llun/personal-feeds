Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi demonstrated the ability to set an iPad near a Mac, move the cursor of the latter toward the former, and have the iPad automatically recognize it. This makes it possible to directly drag and drop files between the devices, for instance. Apple demonstrated this feature working across an iMac, MacBook, and iPad in concert.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770188#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770188&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"492abdbc05abe5be2aace1d88bff2b9e7708863d5f67269f307c23b226763382","category":"Tech"}
