Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi demonstrated the ability to simply set an iPad near a Mac, move the cursor of the latter toward the former, and have the iPad automatically recognize it. This means users can directly drag and drop files between devices, for instance. Apple demonstrated the feature across an iMac, MacBook, and iPad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770188#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1770188&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"492abdbc05abe5be2aace1d88bff2b9e7708863d5f67269f307c23b226763382","category":"Tech"}
