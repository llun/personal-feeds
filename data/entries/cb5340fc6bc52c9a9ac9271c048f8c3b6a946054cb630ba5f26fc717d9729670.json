I happen to know him, and we were in the same place, so he\nwas like, “Have you listened to this?” And he sends me this song\nand he was really excited. He said, “I can’t believe what I can do\nwith this.” It’s going to be really exciting to see how this\nevolves, and all of what artists are going to be able to do with\nthis, and how exciting it is for fans and listeners to be able to\ndo this.</p>\n\n<p>So we went after the labels and are going to the artists and\neducating them on it. There’s a lot of work to be done because\nwe have, obviously, tens of millions of songs. This is not a\nsimple “take-the-file that you have in stereo, processes through\nthis software application and out comes Dolby Atmos.” This\nrequires somebody who’s a sound engineer, and the artist to sit\nback and listen, and really make the right calls and what the\nright things to do are. It’s a process that takes time, but it’s\nworth it. […]</p>\n\n<p>To me, when I look at Dolby Atmos, I think it’s going to do for\nmusic what HD did for television. Today, where can you watch\ntelevision that’s not in HD?</p>\n\n<p>One of the advantages music has over television is you can’t take\nan old TV show and truly up-res it to HD because it was shot on\nlow-quality cameras. But in the case of audio, all these things\nwere recorded on multiple tracks, and so it’s possible to go back\nto a lot of the songs and be able to do this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article is behind Billboard’s “Pro” paywall on their website, but <a href=\"https://apple.news/AIeKIhszgRi2m7SM5E5Su8w\">the full interview is available on Apple News</a> — and it seems to work even if you’re not a News+ subscriber.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/08/cue-spatial-audio\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cb5340fc6bc52c9a9ac9271c048f8c3b6a946054cb630ba5f26fc717d9729670","category":"Tech"}
