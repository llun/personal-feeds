In the latest in a long list of acquisitions, including Quarq, Zipp, Powertap, RockShox, Truvativ, and Avid, the TIME acquisition moves SRAM into the pedal market with an established brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM has confirmed it will continue to offer TIME cleats and pedal spare parts beginning &#8220;mid-year 2021&#8221;, but have not yet decided on the continuation of the TIME shoe range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TIME warranties will be honoured by TIME sport until SRAM takes on the sales and service operations later this year. At that point, SRAM has said it &#8220;will integrate TIME Sport into its published warranty policy&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM&#8217;s acquisition of TIME sport&#8217;s pedal and shoe line follows Cardinal Cycling Group&#8217;s recent purchase of the French brand&#8217;s bike and frame lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a statement on the SRAM website, both new owners will keep the iconic TIME branding, &#8220;Both companies will continue to market products under the TIME name. SRAM will focus relevant external communications as TIME Sport, and Cardinal Cycling Group will utilize TIME Bicycles.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"811\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Time-Cyclo-10-pedal-profile-copy-1340x811.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-42108\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Time-Cyclo-10-pedal-profile-copy-1340x811.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Time-Cyclo-10-pedal-profile-copy-650x393.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Time-Cyclo-10-pedal-profile-copy-190x115.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Time-Cyclo-10-pedal-profile-copy-16x10.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Time-Cyclo-10-pedal-profile-copy.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>TIME&#8217;s road and mountain bike pedals retain a cult following, but are less popular than they once were.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>TIME has a long history in clipless pedals, with its first release back in 1987. Since then, TIME grew to become a powerhouse in the cycling industry, arguably one of the most popular pedals at a time, before <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/12/time-cyclo-10-pedal-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fading in recent years</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, the peak for TIME was circa 2005 when its pedals were popular on both pro and amateur bikes. The Quickstep teams rode TIME carbon frames, and Tom Boonen powered a TIME VXRS Ulteam and RXS pedals to Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, and World Championship glory in one glorious season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, SRAM had not yet entered the road market. Fast forward 16 years and SRAM is now an industry leader well accustomed to acquiring other brands. What exactly SRAM has planned for the TIME range, only time will tell. However, we did <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/heres-what-the-disappearance-of-powertap-might-mean/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">speculate last week</a> what the disappearance of Powertap, another SRAM acquired brand, might mean. Could a TIME pedals provide another twist in that story? </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/sram-acquires-time-pedal-and-shoe-lines/\">SRAM acquires TIME pedals.
