(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Much has been written about people embracing nostalgia for comfort during the COVID-19 pandemic. With <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fimac-24%2F&amp;subid1=ArsiMac24Review\" target=\"_blank\">the new 24-inch iMac's</a> bright colors and simplistic design, Apple seems to be indulging in the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/08/the-imac-is-20-years-old-this-week/\" target=\"_blank\">pangs of nostalgia</a>, too.</p>\n<p>But the new iMac's nostalgia is only skin deep. Inside, it has arguably the most advanced CPU currently sold in consumer devices: the M1. This chip is equally at home in an iPad and a Mac, yet the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/\" target=\"_blank\">M1 delivers performance</a> that rivals or beats some of the best desktop chips available in some cases.</p>\n<p>Even though the M1 offers enough performance to attract power users, this new iMac isn't really for them. Rather, the 24-inch iMac is first and foremost about simplicity. It's a computer that promises users they won't have to think about how to configure or maintain a system. It's a computer that's more concerned about fitting into the room than it is about taking you somewhere else.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768133#p3\">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768133&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9f6cec10ae6baad624e7cab7f3a44820628b1fa16d3ed957486e9112ca2f268","category":"Tech"}
