Two of our favorite deals are still available at their all-time lows: The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M7S6K/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">M1 MacBook Air for $900</a> ($99 off) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J6FD94H/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPad Air for $520 ($79 off)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entry-level MacBook Air is technically Apple’s least-capable M1 Mac, but for $900 it’s still a great bargain. You’re getting an M1 chip with a 7-core GPU (versus 8 cores on most other M1 models) but that won’t matter in most tasks. Otherwise, you’re getting the same feature-set on the 13-inch MacBook Pro: two Thunderbolt ports, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a Magic Keyboard, and a 13.3-inch retina display. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">In our 4.5-star review</a>, we called it “An absolutely stunning debut for Apple silicon in a Mac.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also still on sale is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234771/ipad-air-2020-review.html\">the newest iPad Air</a> for $520. While you’ll need to buy it in green to get this price (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J5WFP7B/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">rose gold and silver are available for $539</a>), but it’s a very nice color. Aside from the hue, you’re getting a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display with True Tone, USB-C, Touch ID built into the power button, and second-gen Apple Pencil support. This model comes with 64GB of storage, but if you want more, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B08J6FVJMX/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon will knock $100 off the 256GB model</a>, bringing it down to $649.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know how long these holdover deals will last, so if you’re interested, head over to Amazon and grab one.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"da028060304b5c15a97801738d99260b1fa65f02fe89388525e09ec681cc14c8","category":"Apple"}
