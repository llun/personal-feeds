Expanding the base of consumers who use the FCC Speed Test app will enable us to provide improved coverage information to the public and add to the measurement tools we're developing to show where broadband is truly available throughout the United States,\" said Acting Chairwoman Rosenworcel.</blockquote>The app, which is available on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, allows consumers to measure the speeds of their mobile and in-home broadband networks. It evaluates download and upload speed, latency, jitter, and packet loss, and it tracks speed data over time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to providing the FCC with granular broadband deployment data, in the future, it will be used to challenge provider-submitted maps when Broadband Data Collection Systems become available.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fcc/\">FCC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/fcc-speed-test-app/\">FCC Asks Americans to Use FCC Speed Test App to Measure U.S. Broadband Availability</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fcc-asks-americans-to-use-fcc-speed-test-app-to-measure-u-s-broadband-availability.2291461/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=utHbFeVRMeM:ahGbr-ne0VQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=utHbFeVRMeM:ahGbr-ne0VQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/utHbFeVRMeM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8f59073cde47832f5f0b5ca80b92dd08425401c06094a2657152b6cddb67762b","category":"Apple"}
