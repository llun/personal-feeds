But it has remained little changed since 2016 as Tesla has focused on the cheaper but much higher volume Models 3 and Y. Five years is a long time in the car world, and others in the industry—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/we-got-our-first-ride-in-the-electric-lucid-air-sedan/\">notably Lucid</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/mercedes-goes-all-out-with-its-new-electric-luxury-sedan-the-eqs/\">Mercedes-Benz</a>—have the potential to change what was once the default answer to the question \"what's the best, fanciest electric car I can buy?\"</p>\n<p>The Model S Plaid is Tesla's response to all the upstarts, and the first 25 vehicles will meet their new owners on Friday. \"Then [Tesla] basically should be at several hundred cars per week soon and a thousand cars per week next quarter,\" Musk told attendees.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we're light on technical specs—Tesla got rid of those kinds of resources when it decided to do away with a press office. Its three-motor powertrain provides a peak power of 1,020 hp (760 kW). That's sufficient for a sub-2 second time in the 0-60 mph (0-98 km/h) dash (with a rollout) and a 9.23-second 1/4-mile time, which really is quick. Top speed will be 200 mph (321 km/h), but if you plan to drive that fast, you'll have to wait until the fall, when the right tires and wheels are available.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772426#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1772426&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
