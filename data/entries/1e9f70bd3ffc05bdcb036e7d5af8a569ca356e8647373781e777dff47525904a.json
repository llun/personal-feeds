{"title":"AirTag Shipping Estimates Already Slipping Into May","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/airtag-shipping-estimates-slip/","date":1619184160000,"content":"Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag item tracker</a> became <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/airtags-orders-now-available/\">available to pre-order</a> today at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and shipping estimates are already beginning to slip from Friday, April 30 launch day delivery into the first week of May or later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-zipper.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the United States, for example, a single AirTag is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/1-pack\">now estimated for delivery on May 3-5</a>, but the four-pack option is still available for delivery on April 30 as of writing. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/airtag\">AirTag accessories</a> are also estimated for delivery in May, while the AirTag Hermès keychain and luggage tag are estimated for delivery in June.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEngraving an AirTag with letters or emoji also results in extended shipping estimates, so take that into consideration when ordering.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPriced at $29 each or $99 for a four pack, users can attach an AirTag to things like a wallet, keys, purse, or backpack and then keep track of the item's location in the Find My app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. AirTags‌ are similar to Tile trackers, but they have a U1 chip for Ultra Wideband that enables improved location accuracy when tracking items with iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 models. (Tile is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/tile-item-trackers-ultra-wideband/\">reportedly working on its own Ultra Wideband tracker</a>.)\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPre-orders also began today for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini in a new purple color. Many configurations remain available for April 30 delivery.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/airtag-shipping-estimates-slip/\">AirTag Shipping Estimates Already Slipping Into May</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-shipping-estimates-already-slipping-into-may.2292932/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5TzY1zPiAXY:Gwgkf3UtuLY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5TzY1zPiAXY:Gwgkf3UtuLY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5TzY1zPiAXY\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1e9f70bd3ffc05bdcb036e7d5af8a569ca356e8647373781e777dff47525904a","category":"Apple"}
