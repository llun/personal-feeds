Apple will use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Family Sharing to enable up to five people to share an ‌Apple Card‌ account.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>‌Apple Card‌ can be shared with any eligible customer who is 18 years or older as a co-owner, providing the opportunity for both to build credit history together, get the flexibility of a combined limit, provide transparency into each other’s spending, share the responsibility of making payments, and deliver the convenience of a single monthly bill to pay.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Card‌ can be shared with anyone who is 13 years or older as a participant, so they can learn how to spend independently and responsibly, while giving co-owners transparency and features that provide insight into purchases and control over their purchase limit. Participants over the age of 18 can also opt in to credit reporting.</blockquote>The new features with ‌Apple Card‌ will be coming in May, likely through an upcoming iOS update.
