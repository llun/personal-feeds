The way that we're consuming stories is changing. Game of Thrones was really the first of these big, giant novelistic shows, and now with Foundation we can tell the story hopefully over the course of 80 episodes, 80 hours, as opposed to trying to condense it all into two or three hours for a single film.</blockquote>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHe added that he hopes future seasons will continue to be mostly shot in Malta. Malta was selected for much of Foundation's shooting schedule for its \"copious water tanks,\" being appropriate for Foundation's water planet setting, and due to being suitably versatile for shooting a range of environments during a time in which global travel has been limited. Malta's Film Commissioner, Johann Grech, highlighted that Foundation is the first &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; show to be produced in Malta.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThis is the first time that a senior crew member has spoken publicly about an &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; show running for such a long period of time, and seems surprisingly confident given that the first season of Foundation has yet to even finish shooting.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/11/apple-shares-dickinson-season-2-trailer/\">Dickinson</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/22/servant-season-2-trailer-january-15-debut/\">Servant</a>\" are the only &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; shows to have premiered a second season so far, with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-for-all-mankind-season-2/\">second season of \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/10/apple-for-all-mankind-season-2/\">For All Mankind</a>\"</a> set to arrive on Friday, February 19. &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; show \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/14/apple-tv-plus-ted-lasso-trailer/\">Ted Lasso</a>\" is highly likely to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/22/apple-tv-show-ted-lasso-likely-to-end-after-season-3/\">end at three seasons</a> despite its success with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/ted-lasso-golden-globe-award-nomination/\">critics</a> and audiences. The show was renewed for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/19/ted-lasso-renewed-season-2/\">second</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/28/apple-renews-ted-lasso-season-3/\">third season</a> not long after the first season was released. Servant has also been renewed for a third season.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGiven that only two &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; shows have premiered second seasons and been renewed for third seasons, it is far too early to speculate on whether Foundation will reach as many as eight seasons. Nevertheless, discussion of a considerably longer, overarching narrative than has otherwise been seen on &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; so far, and comparison to the highly successful Game of Thrones may indicate that Apple has very ambitious plans for Foundation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe first, ten-episode season of Foundation is expected to debut on &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; in the fall of 2021.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/malta/\">Malta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/12/foundation-showrunner-hopes-for-80-episodes/\">&#039;Foundation&#039; Showrunner Hopes for Unparalleled 80 Episodes on Apple TV+</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foundation-showrunner-hopes-for-unparalleled-80-episodes-on-apple-tv.2284402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fmeF1hm1T98:hKFxpuXvhzg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fmeF1hm1T98:hKFxpuXvhzg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fmeF1hm1T98\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"92e41072418114ad9481ffcef1425a0014e93dc208b44f688e5fccedb2143d20","category":"Apple"}
