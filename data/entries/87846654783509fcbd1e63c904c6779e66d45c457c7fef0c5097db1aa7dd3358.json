Amadine is designed with an intuitive, easy to understand interface that makes vector graphic work accessible to beginners and more experienced artists alike. It has all of the features of the <a href=\"https://amadine.com\">Amadine Mac app</a>, but has been optimized for a touch and Apple Pencil experience.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amadine-ipad-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789459\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIf you've never drawn in an iPad app before, Amadine is straightforward enough that you can spend 10 minutes learning the tools and then have enough knowledge to create simple graphics and eventually, more complex works of art.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amadine-ipad-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789460\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's a Quick Start Guide that lets you jump right in with gesture tutorials, a series of videos that teach you how to use the tools, and an online help interface for when you need assistance.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAmadine works seamlessly with the Apple Pencil on all compatible iPad models, with support for pressure sensitivity. All of the tools you might need for creating vector art and illustrations are included.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amadine-ipad-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789462\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are more than 30 vector design tools for drawing, editing, slicing, and typing, including the Pen tool for precision-driven curve creation. You can add multiple strokes and fills with stroke profiles available, and text can be included along a path or inside a shape.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amadine-ipad-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789461\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nPaths can be added using the Path and Draw tools, with options to add, remove, and rearrange anchor points. Points can be converted to corner points and smooth points, plus there are Knife, Scissor, and Eraser tools for editing paths and shapes. All paths and shapes can use multiple strokes, fills, and gradients.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amadine-ipad-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789464\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWith the draw tool, users can take advantage of the Brushes built into the app to use with the freehand Pencil tool for creating smooth vector lines. The Width tool allows for the creation of unique strokes that can be used in drawings, and there are graphics effects options like Inner Glow, Outer Glow, Shadow, and Blur to add depth and style.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAmadine is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amadine/id1339199390\">free to download</a> and the full feature set is available, but the free version is limited to a single document at a time. To work with multiple documents and to share those documents across devices, a one-time &#36;9.99 purchase is required.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/amadine-ipad-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-789463\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.belightsoft.com\">Belight Software</a> is providing a 128GB 11-inch iPad Pro and Apple Pencil 2 so one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader can try out the Amadine iPad app for creating art.
