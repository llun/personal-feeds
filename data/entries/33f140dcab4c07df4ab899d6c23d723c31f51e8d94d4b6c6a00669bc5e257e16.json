{"title":"Tom’s Guide Awards 2021: The M1 Chip","link":"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/toms-guide-hero-awards-2021","date":1625859657000,"content":"\n<p>Tom’s Guide:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After creating the A Series for the iPhone and scaling it up for\nthe iPad, Apple’s team of engineers set its sights on the Mac, but\nthe M1 chip couldn’t just match what Intel had to offer. It had to\nhandily beat it.</p>\n\n<p>“If somebody else could build a chip that was actually going to\ndeliver better performance inside that enclosure, what’s the\npoint? Why would we switch?” said Tim Milet, vice president of\nplatform architecture at Apple. “And so for my chip architects,\nthat was the target.” […]</p>\n\n<p>The most striking thing about the M1 is its battery life. For\nexample, the MacBook Pro lasted an astounding 16 hours and 25\nminutes in our web-surfing test. The previous Intel model lasted\n10:21. That’s a huge difference, and this increase caused more\nthan one double take within Apple.</p>\n\n<p>“When we saw that first system and then you sat there and played\nwith it for a few hours and the battery didn’t move, we thought\n‘Oh man, that’s a bug, the battery indicator is broken,’” said Bob\nBorchers, VP of worldwide product marketing for Apple. “And then\nTim’s laughing in the background, ‘Nope, that’s the way it’s\nsupposed to be’ and it was pretty phenomenal.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/09/toms-guide-m1\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"33f140dcab4c07df4ab899d6c23d723c31f51e8d94d4b6c6a00669bc5e257e16","category":"Tech"}
