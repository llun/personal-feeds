The new 11-inch iPad Pro has the exact same dimensions as the A12-based versions, so the 11-inch Magic Keyboard isn’t changed. Sucks if you’re a big-time iPad user upgrading from one recent 12.9-inch model to the new one, but I don’t know what else Apple could have done.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/23/ipad-pro-new-keyboard\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"dc03abbab76ebed1030c07fdbd9a1001959c821a0685168cf1cd4e56db956161","category":"Tech"}
