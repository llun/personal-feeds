Email marketers and other interests often\nembed these trackers in HTML emails so they can track how often,\nwhen and where you open your emails. This plugin works by\nstripping out a good majority of these spy pixels out of the HTML\nbefore display, rendering the typical advice of <em>disabling “load\nremote content in messages” unnecessary</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Browse your inbox privately with images displayed once again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a simple installer to download, and <a href=\"https://github.com/apparition47/MailTrackerBlocker\">the project’s GitHub page</a> has instructions for installing via HomeBrew. I’ve been running it since Wednesday, and it seems to do just what it says on the tin — it blocks many (most?) marketing and newsletter trackers without requiring you to turn off all remote images. When it does block something, there’s a very subtle indication — the small “ⓧ” button turns blue. Click that button and you get an alert telling you what it blocked. Simple and unobtrusive.</p>\n\n<p>MailTrackerBlocker is a cool project Lee has made available for free, but he has a <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/apparition47\">sponsor page</a> where you can send some dough to thank him. (I sent him a one-time donation via PayPal — you should too if you dig this as much as I do.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘MailTrackerBlocker for Apple Mail on MacOS’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/26/mailtrackerblocker\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"61b7574850b870ea99207500878f22efdcc48d7cf96be4a456e3bde84e4d4a4d","category":"Tech"}
