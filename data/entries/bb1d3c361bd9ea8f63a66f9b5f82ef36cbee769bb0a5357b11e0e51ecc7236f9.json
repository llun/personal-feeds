The result of the NLRB's initial vote count was 1,798 votes against the union and 738 in favor. Hundreds of additional ballots were not counted because their authenticity was disputed. But the \"no\" side already has a majority of the 3,215 votes cast, making the issue moot.</p>\n<p><strong>Original story, April 8: </strong>A closely watched effort to unionize an Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama appears to be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/technology/amazon-union-vote.html\">headed for defeat</a>. With about half the votes counted, 1,100 workers have voted against forming a union, while only 463 voted in favor.</p>\n<p>The National Labor Relations Board is counting the 3,215 votes that were cast by workers at the Bessemer facility. The union needs to win at least half the votes in order to become the official representative of the roughly 6,000 workers at the Bessemer facility. Counting has ended for the evening and is scheduled to resume at 8:30 am Central Time on Friday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755663#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755663&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
