Here’s one more: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B08N5LLDSG?tag=macworld05-20\">Amazon is selling the M1 MacBook Pro for $1,150 today</a>, slashing $150 off the price and bringing it down to an all-time-low price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the iMac, the MacBook Pro has Apple’s new M1 processor, which brings impressive speed gains over the prior model as well as up to 20 hours of battery life, a 16-core neural engine, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of unified memory. It’s all wrapped up inside a 13-inch retina display with with Touch ID built into the newest Magic Keyboard. In or 4.5-star review, we called the MacBook Pro “an astounding machine” that’s nothing less than “a revolutionary moment for the Mac.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want more storage or RAM, you’ll need to look elsewhere, but if you’re happy with the base model—which is definitely a solid machine—go grab one before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>M1 MacBook Pro (2020)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Macbook-pro-m1-2020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299 (256GB), $1,499 (512GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=macworld05-20&amp;#038;linkCode=ogi&amp;#038;th=1&amp;#038;psc=1&amp;ascsubtag=1-1-344277-0-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">$1,149.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aa74d9bcea2434ae550185e2ef805e3eaae9e40c560de920a11e06a4aa20c674","category":"Apple"}
