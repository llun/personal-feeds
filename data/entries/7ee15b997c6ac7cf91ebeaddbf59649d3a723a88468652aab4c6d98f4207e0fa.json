Apple has instead outlined a series of rules, each rule\nbeing worded somewhat differently between the App Privacy\ndocumentation and the App Tracking Transparency documentation.

It seems\nlike it <em>could</em> be possible to use them. It seems even more\npossible that Facebook and Google could make them usable. However,\nthis puts developers in the situation of evaluating the changing\ndocumentation, complex privacy policies, and large settings panels\nthat these tools offer, trying to judge whether a given setup of a\ngiven SDK would now pass muster from Apple’s perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What’s becoming obvious is that these coming changes in iOS 14.5 are about a <em>lot</em> more than just the IDFA tracking identifier.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Is Apple Banning Free Analytics SDKs?’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/09/pike-app-store-analytics\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7ee15b997c6ac7cf91ebeaddbf59649d3a723a88468652aab4c6d98f4207e0fa","category":"Tech"}
