Select customers will be invited from the Coinbase Card waitlist starting this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/coinbase-apple-pay.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCoinbase Card is a debit card, so signing up will not impact your credit score, and there are no application fees. Once you are approved for the card, you can immediately begin spending with Apple Pay and Google Pay, even before the physical card arrives in the mail. Coinbase is offering up to 4% in \"crypto rewards\" for purchases made with the card.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKeep in mind that the card will not allow you to spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin directly. Coinbase will automatically convert the cryptocurrency that you wish to spend to U.S. dollars and transfer the funds to your Coinbase Card for Apple Pay purchases and ATM withdrawals. Conversion fees will apply, as <a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees\">outlined on Coinbase's website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMacRumors had discovered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/apple-pay-coinbase-evidence/\">evidence of Apple Pay support</a> coming to the Coinbase Card in April.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/coinbase/\">Coinbase</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/coinbase-card-now-supports-apple-pay/\">Coinbase Card Now Supports Apple Pay for Easy Spending of Cryptocurrency</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/coinbase-card-now-supports-apple-pay-for-easy-spending-of-cryptocurrency.2298757/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ECeULQcLkeo:UQcOkKFcU8A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ECeULQcLkeo:UQcOkKFcU8A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ECeULQcLkeo\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b3063906f728db1176b278bd22bd7c7987b413112635c694d15a3c1952f3b40d","category":"Apple"}
