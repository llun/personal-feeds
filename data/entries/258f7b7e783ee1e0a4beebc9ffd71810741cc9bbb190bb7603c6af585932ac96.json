The case study in this collection should provide information valuable for understanding how to develop services that leverage Consul during any stage of your journey. Topics covered in this collection include:</p>\n<h2><a class=\"__permalink-h\" href=\"#understanding-the-value-of-migrating-to-microservices\" aria-label=\"understanding the value of migrating to microservices permalink\">»</a><a class=\"__target-h\" id=\"understanding-the-value-of-migrating-to-microservices\" aria-hidden></a>Understanding the Value of Migrating to Microservices</h2>\n<p>Consul service mesh features enable organizations of any size to implement a controlled migration <a href=\"https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/kubernetes-migrate-to-microservices?utm_source=WEBSITE&#x26;utm_medium=WEB_BLOG&#x26;utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE\">from a monolith to microservices</a> without disrupting current workflows or system availability.
