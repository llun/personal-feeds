The report claims Apple is looking for sensors that would still be considered \"cutting edge\" four to five years from now.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-774150\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAs widely rumored, the report claims Apple has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years. Apple is said to have independently developed most of the necessary software and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for the vehicle, but the so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a>\" is still believed to be years away from a potential release.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nFrom the report:<blockquote>The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is in active talks with a number of potential suppliers for these laser-based sensors that allow a car's computer to \"see\" its surroundings, said the people, who asked not to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions. The company has been working on a driverless vehicle project for several years and has developed on its own most of the necessary software, underlying processors and artificial intelligence algorithms needed for such a sophisticated system.</blockquote>In regulatory filings earlier this month, Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia said they are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/07/hyundai-says-not-in-apple-car-discussions/\">not in discussions with Apple over development of a self-driving vehicle</a>. Hyundai had previously stated that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-hyundai-negotiations/\">was in talks with Apple</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/19/apple-car-lidar-sensors-active-talks/\">Apple Reportedly in Active Talks With Multiple LiDAR Sensor Suppliers for Self-Driving Vehicle</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-in-active-talks-with-multiple-lidar-sensor-suppliers-for-self-driving-vehicle.2285378/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cGhJpu50kAg:bBAffBPNNrg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=cGhJpu50kAg:bBAffBPNNrg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/cGhJpu50kAg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2b9da6abf4457081cdade324dfa1467ac2dd3c441aac013577c7f0aa73247d06","category":"Apple"}
