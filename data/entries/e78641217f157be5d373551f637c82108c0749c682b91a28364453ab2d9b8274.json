A team of researchers recently published <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ee/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ee/nvab041/6291416\">a paper</a> surveying the ins and outs of keeping solar production alongside the kinds of plants that pollinators like bees and butterflies love. The paper notes that there's a good amount of potential here, but more work needs to be done to fully understand the potential partnership.</p>\n<p>“I think in some ways, it sounds like a no-brainer that we should be implementing pollinator habitats at these types of facilities. And on one hand, I agree with that, but I think it really does benefit us to figure out the most efficient ways to get these kinds of benefits out there,” Adam Dolezal, assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's department of entomology, told Ars.</p>\n<p>More than <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2020/06/24/pollinators-crossroads\">100 crops</a> in the US rely on pollinators. However, around the world, the number of pollinators has been in decline. Habitat loss is a significant reason for the decline, though there are others, including climate change and invasive species.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771246#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771246&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Doug Johnson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e78641217f157be5d373551f637c82108c0749c682b91a28364453ab2d9b8274","category":"Tech"}
