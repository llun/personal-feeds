Apple has not yet said whether the ‌AirPods Max‌ support lossless audio over Lightning with a digital to analog converter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has confirmed that lossless audio can be listened to on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, but the higher quality audio is not available on ‌AirPods‌, ‌AirPods Pro‌, or ‌AirPods Max‌. Apple lossless is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/homepod-wont-support-lossless-audio/\">not available on the HomePod</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nListening to lossless audio on an iOS device will require wired headphones compatible with the ALAC format, and possibly a digital to analog converter. That the $549 ‌AirPods Max‌ do not work with Apple lossless is sure to upset some fans, but there is debate about whether most people can even tell the difference between standard and lossless audio formats.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThough the ‌AirPods Max‌ headphones do not support lossless audio, they are compatible with Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos, another new feature that Apple is bringing to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>. Spatial Audio will allow artists to create multidimensional music that sounds like it's coming from all around you, and this feature is available on all ‌AirPods‌ and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/airpods-max-no-direct-lossless-lightning-support/\">AirPods Max Won't Directly Support Lossless Apple Music Over Lightning</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-wont-directly-support-lossless-apple-music-over-lightning.2296554/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DPcLD0NMMkw:DcML8ChT5RE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DPcLD0NMMkw:DcML8ChT5RE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DPcLD0NMMkw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cdb509f368d7636c9722911a21db793418a7f0f87adcdf60a1879295234871ca","category":"Apple"}
