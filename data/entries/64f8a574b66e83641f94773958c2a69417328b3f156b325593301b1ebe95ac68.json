If ‌Find My‌ were available for the remote in some capacity, Apple undoubtedly would have mentioned it as a feature.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is perhaps expecting ‌Apple TV‌ users to add an AirTag to the back of the ‌Siri‌ Remote, which would allow it to be tracked via the ‌Find My‌ app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt also appears that the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models are lacking a U1 chip as well, though the new ‌Apple TV‌ does indeed have U1 support. U1 devices now include the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models, new ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile no ‌Find My‌ capabilities are available for the second-generation ‌Siri‌ Remote, it does feature a revamped design with a touch-enabled clickpad.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/siri-remote-no-u1-chip/\">New Siri Remote Doesn't Have U1 Chip and Won't Work With Find My</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-siri-remote-doesnt-have-u1-chip-and-wont-work-with-find-my.2292456/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FWFGgdW9cMk:Ni8YlWIs8ZQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=FWFGgdW9cMk:Ni8YlWIs8ZQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/FWFGgdW9cMk\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64f8a574b66e83641f94773958c2a69417328b3f156b325593301b1ebe95ac68","category":"Apple"}
