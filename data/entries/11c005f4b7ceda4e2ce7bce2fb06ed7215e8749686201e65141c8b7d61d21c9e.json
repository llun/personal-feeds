Crosswinds forced a split in the peloton with more than 100 km to go, but things came back together before long. With around 100 km to go, the pack began to up the pace, and that quickly ate into the break&#8217;s advantage. The catch was made with only a little less than 80 km still to go. From there, attacks would fly for the next hour and a half, but none of the attackers would be able to build much of a gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sebastian Mora</strong> spent a little over 20 km off the front before he was brought back with a little under 40 km to go. <strong>Lluis Mas</strong> and <strong>Davide Martinelli</strong> powered away with a little over 30 km to go, but they were caught around 10 km later. <strong>Brent Van Moer</strong> soloed off the front inside the last 25 km but was kept within sight of the peloton, and he was reeled in again with 11 km to go. From there, things held together over the final kilometers of the race as the sprinters&#8217; teams came to the fore to prepare for a bunch kick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total Direct Energie</strong>, <strong>Jumbo-Visma</strong>, <strong>Deceuninck-Quick-Step</strong>, and <strong>Bahrain Victorious</strong> were all prominent at the front of the pack with 3 km to go, driving a hard tempo into the finale. Deceuninck-Quick-Step led the way with strong numbers at the front into the last kilometer and the Belgian squad maintained its position through the final few corners, with <strong>Groupama-FDJ</strong> also making an effort to bring <strong>Arnaud Démare</strong> close to the front. <strong>Michael Morkov</strong> led into the last 500 meters with Bennett tucked in just behind, while a gearing problem took Démare out of contention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With around 300 meters to go, riders began to wind up to speed on either side of Bennett, who responded quickly and launched around Morkov. Bennett quickly pulled to the front and he held on to take a convincing victory at the line, with Philipsen taking second and Ackermann in third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 BENNETT Sam (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 4:27:40<br>2 PHILIPSEN Jasper (Alpecin-Fenix)<br>3 ACKERMANN Pascal (BORA &#8211; hansgrohe)<br>4 NIZZOLO Giacomo (Team Qhubeka ASSOS)<br>5 DUPONT Timothy (Bingoal &#8211; Wallonie Bruxelles)<br>6 HOFSTETTER Hugo (Israel Start-Up Nation)<br>7 BOL Cees (Team DSM)<br>8 MORKOV Michael (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step)<br>9 VIVIANI Elia (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits)<br>10 ANIOLKOWSKI Stanislaw (Bingoal &#8211; Wallonie Bruxelles)</p>\n\n\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LnAoOuAPA-s\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n\n\n<h3>Adam Yates wins stage 3 of the Volta a Catalunya and takes the overall lead</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Yates</strong> climbed to the stage 3 win and the overall lead on Wednesday at the <strong>Volta a Catalunya</strong>. The 28-year-old Brit soloed to victory at the Vallter 2000 ski resort 13 seconds ahead of <strong>Esteban Chaves</strong>, with <strong>Alejandro Valverde</strong> taking third on the day, 19 seconds back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 203.5 km stage from Canal Olímpico de Catalunya was decided on the slopes of the hors categorie final climb. The last remnants of the day&#8217;s breakaway took several minutes into the challenging ascent, but the gap fell rapidly over the course of the climb. With breakaway riders <strong>Thymen Arensman</strong> and <strong>Alexander Kamp</strong> out front, the chasing pack got smaller and smaller as it made its way up the ascent with big names like Valverde and <strong>Simon Yates</strong> putting in big digs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With around 10 km to go, Arensman dropped Kamp and pressed on alone out front. Behind, Valverde put in another dig with 8 km to go and this time he managed to get clear. At first, there was no clear response from behind, before <strong>Nairo Quintana</strong> jumped with around 7 km to go and made an impressive effort to bridge to his former teammate. The pair rode together for a few moments before they were joined by <strong>Giulio Ciccone</strong> and <strong>Richard Carapaz</strong>, but then <strong>Sepp Kuss</strong> and Adam Yates surged up to join them. Kuss and Yates did not relent as they made the catch, and only Valverde could follow. The trio pressed on as others scrambled to chase out of the larger group of GC riders. Kuss, Valverde, and Yates caught and passed Kamp and then Arensman, riding into the last 3 km at the head of the race. With a little over 2 km to go, Kuss and Yates dropped Valverde, and only a few hundred meters later, Yates put in a stinging attack that dropped Kuss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind, Chaves had jumped out of a select group in pursuit of the leaders. Yates ascended the final 1,600 meters solo to take the stage victory and the race lead, with Chaves taking second on the day and Valverde in third. With four stages to race, Yates has a 45-second GC lead over second-placed <strong>Richie Porte</strong>,&nbsp;who finished ninth on the day. Overnight leader <strong>João Almeida</strong> dropped to third overall after finishing stage 3 46 seconds back in 16th place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, stage 3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 YATES Adam (INEOS Grenadiers) 5:00:58<br>2 CHAVES Esteban (Team BikeExchange) 0:13<br>3 VALVERDE Alejandro (Movistar Team) 0:19<br>4 THOMAS Geraint (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:31<br>5 VANHOUCKE Harm (Lotto Soudal)<br>6 KUSS Sepp (Team Jumbo-Visma)<br>7 CARTHY Hugh (EF Education &#8211; Nippo)<br>8 WOODS Michael (Israel Start-Up Nation) 0:36<br>9 PORTE Richie (INEOS Grenadiers)<br>10 CICCONE Giulio (Trek &#8211; Segafredo)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 YATES Adam (INEOS Grenadiers) 9:44:21<br>2 PORTE Richie (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:45<br>3 ALMEIDA João (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:49<br>4 THOMAS Geraint (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:53<br>5 KELDERMAN Wilco (BORA &#8211; hansgrohe) 1:03<br>6 VALVERDE Alejandro (Movistar Team) 1:04<br>7 CARTHY Hugh (EF Education &#8211; Nippo) 1:14<br>8 YATES Simon (Team BikeExchange) 1:21<br>9 CHAVES Esteban (Team BikeExchange)<br>10 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 1:24</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vingegaard wins Coppi e Bartali stage 2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jonas Vingegaard</strong> nabbed the victory on Wednesday&#8217;s stage 2 of the Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali, winning out of a select group on a tough day of racing that featured five trips up the Sogliano al Rubicone climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenging stage from Riccione came down to a much reduced pack after the day&#8217;s main break was caught after the fourth of five ascents of the Sogliano al Rubicone. There were further attacks on the run-in to the last climb of the day, with <strong>Mauri Vansevenant</strong> and <strong>Juan Ayuso</strong> making their way up the ascent with a small gap, but a select group of chasers was close behind and caught them in the finale. Vingegaard battled <strong>Iván Sosa</strong> in the last few hundred meters and the Dane bested the Colombian at the line to get the win and move into the race lead. Sosa took second on the day and now sits second overall. Four seconds later, <strong>Nick Schultz</strong> nabbed third on the stage ahead of <strong>Ben Hermans</strong>, with Hermans now third on GC and Schultz in fourth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, stage 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 VINGEGAARD Jonas (Team Jumbo-Visma) 4:17:43<br>2 SOSA Iván Ramiro (INEOS Grenadiers)<br>3 SCHULTZ Nick (Team BikeExchange) 0:04<br>4 HERMANS Ben (Israel Start-Up Nation)<br>5 HAYTER Ethan (INEOS Grenadiers)<br>6 VANSEVENANT Mauri (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:10<br>7 VAN WILDER Ilan (Team DSM)<br>8 BRENNER Marco (Team DSM)<br>9 HENAO Sergio (Team Qhubeka)<br>10 ROMO Javier (Astana &#8211; Premier Tech)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 VINGEGAARD Jonas (Team Jumbo-Visma) 6:48:25<br>2 SOSA Iván Ramiro (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:01<br>3 HERMANS Ben (Israel Start-Up Nation) 0:03<br>4 SCHULTZ Nick (Team BikeExchange) 0:05<br>5 ROMO Javier (Astana &#8211; Premier Tech) 0:10<br>6 HAYTER Ethan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:11<br>7 VANSEVENANT Mauri (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step)<br>8 HONORÉ Mikkel Frolich (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:14<br>9 COLLEONI Kevin (Team BikeExchange) 0:20<br>10 HENAO Sergio (Team Qhubeka) 0:31</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Report: Paris-Roubaix will not be held in April</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Le Parisien reported on Wednesday that <strong>Paris-Roubaix</strong> <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/paris-roubaix-postponed-due-to-new-covid-19-restrictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will not be held on April 11</a> as originally planned due to COVID-19 restrictions in France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Le Parisien, the ASO has already decided that the event will not be held.
