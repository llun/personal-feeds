The software maker also said it found no evidence the hackers used the Microsoft compromise to attack customers.</p>\n<p>Microsoft released those findings after completing an investigation begun in December, after learning its network had been compromised. The breach was part of a wide-ranging hack that compromised the distribution system for the widely used Orion network-management software from SolarWinds and pushed out malicious updates to Microsoft and roughly 18,000 other customers.</p>\n<p>The hackers then used the updates to compromise nine federal agencies and about 100 private-sector companies, the White House <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/17/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-and-emerging-technology-anne-neuberger-february-17-2021/\">said on Wednesday</a>.
