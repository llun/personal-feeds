According to Intel, the chip offers \"advanced performance, security, efficiency, and built-in AI acceleration to handle IoT workloads and more powerful AI.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> in January said that Apple is developing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-two-new-mac-pro-models/\">two versions</a> of the new ‌Mac Pro‌, one that's a direct successor to the 2019 ‌Mac Pro‌ and one that offers a smaller form factor that's about half the size.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple has indeed been working on an update to the Intel ‌Mac Pro‌. <a href=\"https://t.co/YgU8KaikeX\">https://t.co/YgU8KaikeX</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1402330560656252936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple is working to transition its entire Mac lineup to Apple silicon, and the smaller ‌Mac Pro‌ will feature Apple silicon chips, but it appears Apple is planning to keep at least one Intel ‌Mac Pro‌ available for the time being.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the high-end Apple silicon chips that Apple is developing feature 20 or 40 computing cores with 64 or 128 core GPUs, but it is not clear if the earliest versions of ‌Mac Pro‌ chips will be able to compete with Intel's Xeon processors for heavy duty professional workloads.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis Intel-based ‌Mac Pro‌ may be one of the last Intel machines as Apple has already started transitioning the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, MacBook Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> lines to Apple silicon.
