People developing applications that use TLS rely on OpenSSL to save time and avoid programming errors that are common when noncryptographers build applications that use complex encryption.</p>\n<p>The crucial role OpenSSL plays in Internet security came into full view in 2014 when hackers began exploiting a critical vulnerability in the open-source code library that let them steal encryption keys, customer information, and other sensitive data from servers all over the world. Heartbleed, as the security flaw was called, demonstrated how a couple lines of faulty code could topple the security of banks, news sites, law firms, and more.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752244#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752244&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"214a29590f53c72047b8bcf2b8c666bc958f94d942d2fe76df71aa47820b826d","category":"Tech"}
