This information lines up with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/26/apple-new-airpods-2020-third-homepod/\">reporting</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em> which states that the design of the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; takes inspiration from the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, although they will lack certain Pro features such as Active Noise Cancellation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe renders should be taken with a grain of salt. However, the images were shared by the Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1369597631832285189\">@Duanrui1205</a>, which has in the past shared accurate information, possibly adding validity to them. The renders also fall in line with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/next-gen-airpods-image-leak/\">alleged real-life images</a> of the upcoming &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, which show them with a smaller stem and replaceable ear tips.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/gizmochina-airpods-3-render@3x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788037\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nJust this week, Chinese leaker \"Kang\" reported that Apple is planning to hold its long-awaited spring event on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">March 23</a>.
