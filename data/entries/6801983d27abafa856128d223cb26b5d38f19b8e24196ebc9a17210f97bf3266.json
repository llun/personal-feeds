Focused on privacy, the Essential Indoor Camera has an automated privacy shield that's designed to cover the lens when needed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/arlo-indoor-essential-camera.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786222\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nCamera owners can activate the privacy lens using the Arlo app, preventing it from recording when people are home. When in \"disarm\" mode, the Essential Camera is unable to record and motion and audio detection is disabled. The camera needs to be put into an active mode to turn off the privacy shield, which can be done by opening a livestream view or changing the camera to \"arm\" mode.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe Essential Indoor Camera is priced at &#36;99.99 and offers 1080p HD video, a 130-degree field of view, motion and audio detection, night vision, support for two-way conversations, and a built-in siren for emergencies. The siren feature can be triggered automatically from motion or audio detection, or activated through the Arlo app to deter would-be intruders.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> integration is not available for the Essential Indoor Camera at this time. Arlo said that it is working to have &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; available on products, but there are no updates on the Essential Indoor Camera. With no &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; availability, the camera can be controlled through the Arlo app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe  Essential Indoor Camera can be purchased <a href=\"https://www.arlo.com/en-us/home\">from the Arlo website</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Essential-Wireless-Security-VMC2040B/dp/B08WDRDRNX\">from Amazon</a> for &#36;99.99.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/arlo/\">Arlo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/arlo-releases-essential-indoor-camera/\">Arlo Releases Privacy-Focused &#36;99 Essential Indoor Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/arlo-releases-privacy-focused-99-essential-indoor-camera.2286757/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8tMZm8214aE:N1VGoaav9Zc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8tMZm8214aE:N1VGoaav9Zc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8tMZm8214aE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6801983d27abafa856128d223cb26b5d38f19b8e24196ebc9a17210f97bf3266","category":"Apple"}
