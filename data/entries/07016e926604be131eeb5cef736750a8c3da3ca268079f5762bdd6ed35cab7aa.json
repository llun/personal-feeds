Samsung has not produced OLED TVs in recent years, focusing instead on variants of LED LCD technology.</p>\n<p>The news comes from a report by South Korean broadcaster <a href=\"https://m.mtn.co.kr/news/news_view.php?mmn_idx=2021040910490127790\">MTN</a>Â (among <a href=\"https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/22L0NM8RQV\">other</a> South Korean news outlets), which says Samsung and LG have reached a conditional deal wherein Samsung would buy as many as 1 million OLED panels from LG this year and 4 million in 2022. MTN clarifies that the deal is not yet final but says only a few details are left to be worked out.</p>\n<p>LG produces most of the world's large-format OLED panels, such as those used for TVs; its panels are not just used in LG TVs but also in TVs sold by Sony, Panasonic, and others. Samsung produces OLED panels as well, but not at TV sizes. Samsung makes OLED panels for smartphones, and those panels use a different technology than what is seen in LG's OLED TVs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755848#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755848&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"07016e926604be131eeb5cef736750a8c3da3ca268079f5762bdd6ed35cab7aa","category":"Tech"}
