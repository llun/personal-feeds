If it is indeed something new, the upcoming &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote could perhaps feature a design similar to the remote app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, which features a large touch area, a main center Menu button, and side buttons for accessing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, play/pause, the Home screen, and search.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is rumored to be working on a sixth-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; that will feature an upgraded A-series chip and a revamped remote control. We haven't heard details on what the remote control might look like, but it could have a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>\" feature for location purposes when lost.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn an earlier beta, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/apple-siri-remote-tvos-14-5-beta/\">Apple renamed</a> the \"&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote\" to the \"&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Remote,\" which is another possible reference to an unreleased &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<b>Update:</b> The code could be referring to a third-party &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; remote that's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/22/uei-alternative-apple-tv-4k-remote/\">in development</a> and which could be offered by Universal Electronics to cable, satellite, and MVPD companies. This remote also has a circular button, and an image of it was found in the beta by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/31/exclusive-heres-our-first-look-at-the-all-new-apple-tv-remote/\">9to5Mac</a></em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's possible the Universal Electronics remote will soon be available from various cable providers who will offer it alongside the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, much like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/30/salt-remote-apple-tv/\">the Salt Remote</a> sold by a Swiss telecommunications company.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/tvos-14-5-beta-6-tv-remote-center-button/\">tvOS 14.5 Beta 6 References Apple TV Remote With &#039;Center Button&#039; [Updated]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-14-5-beta-6-references-apple-tv-remote-with-center-button-updated.2290242/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RznJCWw0hts:tDB0r8SMCT4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RznJCWw0hts:tDB0r8SMCT4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RznJCWw0hts\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"24a138ed21151e9f94264c1e5996496cfea4a289e262032a3242e5f933643f4a","category":"Apple"}
