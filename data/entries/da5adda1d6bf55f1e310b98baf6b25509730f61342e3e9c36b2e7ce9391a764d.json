This stage features three Cat 1s and a Cat 2 on a day that compresses most of its climbing into its Andorran conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-last climb is the tricky Cat 1 Port d’Envalira (10.7 km at 5.9%) – the highest point of the Tour at 2,408 m above sea level. The Col de Beixalis (6.4 km at 8.5%) follows, offering bonus seconds as it tops out 15 km from the finish. It’s all downhill from there. The second rest day follows this stage, so expect riders to hold little back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to watch for:</strong> The altitude might play a role up at 2,400 m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s it for:</strong> This could go either way. Could be one for the breakaway, if the GC contenders are happy with a group up the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>If this stage comes down to the GC riders, it’s hard to look past Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard, although Pogačar’s lead is comfortable enough that he may let Richard Carapaz, who has been aggressive on a few days in this race, go up the road. Should the stage go to the break, Wout van Aert will be a rider to watch, particularly with a punchy final climb followed by a descent to the line. Others to watch include Miguel Ángel López, Julian Alaphilippe, Michael Woods, David Gaudu, and Nairo Quintana.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_PROFILS-ETAPES-SANS-RAVITO_ETP15-1-1340x944.jpeg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TDF21_ET15_carte-1340x947.jpeg\" /></figure>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-15-of-the-2021-tour-de-france/\">Read More</a>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"da5adda1d6bf55f1e310b98baf6b25509730f61342e3e9c36b2e7ce9391a764d","category":"Cycling"}
