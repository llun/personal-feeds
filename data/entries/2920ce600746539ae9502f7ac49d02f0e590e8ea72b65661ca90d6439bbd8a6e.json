Ending outdoor mask mandates — or at the very least telling people when they can expect outdoor mask mandates to lift — is a good place to start, for a few reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Requiring that people always wear masks when they leave home, and especially in places with low levels of viral transmission, is overkill. As mentioned, the coronavirus disperses outside, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext\">posing little risk</a> to people who are walking alone or even swiftly passing by strangers. In fact, almost all of the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext\">documented cases</a> of outdoor transmission have involved long conversations, or face-to-face <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1382871634537775107?s=20\">yelling</a>. The risk calculation changes if you’re standing in a crowd: <a href=\"https://kateto.net/covid19/COVID19%20CONSORTIUM%20REPORT%2010%20PROTEST%20AUGUST%202020.pdf\">Some</a> <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408\">uneven</a> <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454741/\">evidence</a> suggests that the Black Lives Matter protests last summer increased local infections. But that’s an easy carve-out. States can end blanket mandates and still recommend outdoor masking by anyone experiencing symptoms, or in crowds. (Extended conversations pose their own risk, but when people are vaccinated, the odds of viral transmission are probably somewhere<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-identifies-small-group-of-covid-19-infections-among-fully-vaccinated-patients-11618490232?mod=hp_lead_pos7\"> between microscopic and nonexistent</a>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His closing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We can reduce unnecessary private anxiety and unhelpful public shame by thinking for a few seconds about how the coronavirus actually works and how to finally end the pandemic. Let’s tell people the truth and trust that they can take it. Let’s plan for the end of outdoor mask mandates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/19/thompson-face-masks\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2920ce600746539ae9502f7ac49d02f0e590e8ea72b65661ca90d6439bbd8a6e","category":"Tech"}
