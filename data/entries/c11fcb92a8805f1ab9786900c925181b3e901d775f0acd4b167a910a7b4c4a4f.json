{"title":"Newer Macs Can Use Another Mac as an External Display on macOS Monterey","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/airplay-mac-to-mac-external-display/","date":1623273036000,"content":"One of the key new features of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> is the ability to AirPlay content to a Mac from other Apple devices, such as an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac. According to the macOS Monterey <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/features/\">features page</a>, AirPlay to Mac works works both wirelessly or wired using a USB cable, with Apple noting that a wired connection is useful when you want to ensure that there's no latency or don't have access to a Wi-Fi connection.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/imac-macbook-pro-macos-monterey.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAirPlay to Mac also allows users to extend or mirror an Apple device's display to a Mac, and we've confirmed this works on a Mac-to-Mac basis. This makes it possible for supported Macs to use another Mac as an external display, and with AirPlay to Mac working both wirelessly or with a wired connection, Apple has come close to reviving <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592\">Target Display Mode</a>, which allowed 2009 to 2014 iMac models to serve as another Mac's external display.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's worth noting that these new AirPlay features do not serve as a complete Target Display Mode replacement, as we've been told that AirPlay compresses video sent from one Mac to another, and at least some latency might still be possible.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStarting with macOS Monterey, a supported Mac can also function as an AirPlay 2 speaker source, allowing users to wirelessly stream music or podcasts from an Apple device to a Mac or use the computer as a secondary speaker for multi-room audio.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirPlay to Mac works with a 2018 or later MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, a 2019 or later iMac or Mac Pro, an iMac Pro, and the 2020 Mac mini.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nmacOS Monterey is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-beta-1/\">available now in beta for developers</a>, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update will likely be publicly released for all compatible Macs at some point between late September and early November.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/airplay-mac-to-mac-external-display/\">Newer Macs Can Use Another Mac as an External Display on macOS Monterey</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/newer-macs-can-use-another-mac-as-an-external-display-on-macos-monterey.2300145/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lwZ17tS6kC8:s4221tR4_PQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lwZ17tS6kC8:s4221tR4_PQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lwZ17tS6kC8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c11fcb92a8805f1ab9786900c925181b3e901d775f0acd4b167a910a7b4c4a4f","category":"Apple"}
