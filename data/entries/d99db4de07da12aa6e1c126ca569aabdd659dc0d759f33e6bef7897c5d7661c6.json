We work relentlessly to build it into everything we make, and it's fundamental to how we design and engineer every product and service that we put out into the world. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile others have focused on making customers the product, collecting ever-growing amounts of personal information, we've kept the lens focused on how technology can work for people. And that's meant introducing countless features that give users transparency and choice over how their data is collected, used, and shared. You see that with new tools like Privacy Nutrition Labels and App Tracking Transparency, which gives users more information, more choice, and greater transparency about how their data is used. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe know that privacy is a priority for our users in Europe and around the world. It's why we're always striving to set a higher bar, with new tools that put people in the driver's seat when it comes to managing your own data.</blockquote>The video then cuts to segments taken from last week's WWDC keynote, where Apple executives and engineers explain new features including Mail Privacy Protection, App Privacy Report, Offline <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> support, and more. Cook then sees out the video with the following comments:<blockquote>These big privacy features are the latest in a long string of innovations our teams have developed to improve transparency and put users in control of their data. They're features that will help give users peace of mind by strengthening that control and the freedom to use their technology without worrying about who is looking over their shoulder. At Apple, our commitment is to give users choice over how their data is used and to build privacy and security into everything we make. </blockquote>‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ are currently in developer beta, with a public beta coming next month and the official version set to release in the fall.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/\">Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple privacy</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/15/tim-cook-privacy-video-europe/\">Tim Cook Highlights Apple's iOS 15 Privacy Protections in New Video for European Audiences</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-highlights-apples-ios-15-privacy-protections-in-new-video-for-european-audiences.2300975/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8YbfO3Yw6vY:-f-nszOnEXc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=8YbfO3Yw6vY:-f-nszOnEXc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/8YbfO3Yw6vY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d99db4de07da12aa6e1c126ca569aabdd659dc0d759f33e6bef7897c5d7661c6","category":"Apple"}
