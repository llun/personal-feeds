Can confirm that is not the case. Apple fans can relax!</p>— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1383098367102709765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 16, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/iphone-13-pro-120hz-display-rumors/\">LTPO OLED displays</a> feature a more power efficient backplane able to turn the individual pixels on and off on the display, better preserving battery life. Young has previously said that LTPO technology is linked to 120Hz refresh rates and will need to be implemented before ProMotion can be brought to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, otherwise the 120Hz refresh rate would drain too much battery life.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt this point, multiple rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">have confirmed</a> both LTPO technology and 120Hz refresh rates for the two Pro-level ‌iPhone 13‌ models. 120Hz ProMotion displays were rumored for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models as well, but Apple did not implement them and instead saved the feature for the ‌iPhone 13‌ lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSamsung <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/samsung-supply-120hz-panels-iphone-13-pro/\">will supply</a> most of the LTPO OLED displays to Apple, with Apple also potentially sourcing displays from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/iphone-13-boe-display-panels/\">BOE and LG Display</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has long offered 120Hz refresh rates in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> lineup. As on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the higher refresh rate on the ‌iPhone‌ will make motion content on the screen smoother, crisper, and more responsive for tasks like reading, gaming, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/16/ltpo-120hz-display-iphone-13-pro-models/\">LTPO Displays Supporting 120Hz Refresh Rates Again Rumored for iPhone 13 Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ltpo-displays-supporting-120hz-refresh-rates-again-rumored-for-iphone-13-pro-models.2291928/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2kmtHY1k2dQ:xo5pu5Dkggc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2kmtHY1k2dQ:xo5pu5Dkggc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2kmtHY1k2dQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae926067ce129d58196d7a451760c045cae4fe7231a9bebaa5bac20e79243877","category":"Apple"}
