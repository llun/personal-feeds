The new Drive app builds in features from Google Photos, Backup and Sync (the old, primarily consumer app), and Drive File Stream (the old, business-targeted version).</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>Frankly, there doesn't appear to be much new in the upgraded app—the update looks like more of a clean-up and unification effort than anything else. Major features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Uploading and syncing photos to Google cloud storage—including automatic compression and resizing, for those choosing \"Storage saver\" rather than original image quality</li>\n<li>Syncing external storage devices (thumb drives, USB hard drives, and SSDs) to Google Drive</li>\n<li>(Optional) two-way file and folder synchronization—automatically download files to local folders, as well as the other way around</li>\n<li>Locally mounted Drive folders in either Stream or Mirror mode—automatically downloading files on-demand, or automatically prefetching all files from the cloud</li>\n<li>In-app support for shared Google drives (new feature, was not present in Backup and Sync)</li>\n<li>Integration with Microsoft Outlook and Google Meet scheduling</li>\n</ul><h2>Upgrading to the new Drive app</h2>\n<p>According to Google's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/drive/drive-for-desktop/\">introduction</a>, users of the older Backup and Sync app will start getting in-app prompts to transition to Drive for desktop, which it recommends users complete by September of this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779598#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779598&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"18280c63f86173830583ab382db0a93e0a47733cbcf59a4f7f867b096aedf341","category":"Tech"}
