That terminal costs us more than $1,000,\" Musk said yesterday during a Mobile World Congress Q&amp;A session (see a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcnVTgrgThE\">YouTube video</a> posted by CNET). \"We obviously are subsidizing the cost of the terminal. We are working on next-generation terminals that provide the same level of capability, roughly the same level of capability, but cost a lot less.\"</p>\n<p>Musk noted that \"selling terminals for half price is not super compelling\" given that SpaceX is planning for millions of Starlink customers. \"Over time, we'd like to reduce the terminal cost from $500 to, I don't know, $300 or $250, or something like that.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777328#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777328&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"59a45696d9e025a65ec12f6acd2c729368dc59f20e7138dfaa8053424520d24a","category":"Tech"}
