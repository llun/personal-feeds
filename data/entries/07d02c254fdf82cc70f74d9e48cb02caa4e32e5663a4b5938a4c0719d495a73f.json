Lenovo and HP continue to be market leaders, shipping a variety of PC notebooks running Windows alongside Chromebooks, which saw strong growth in the education sector.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/pc-notebook-market-share-strategy-analytics.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTotal notebook PC shipments were up 81 percent year over year among all major vendors, but Apple in particular may have seen major growth thanks to the November launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> 13-inch MacBook Pro and ‌MacBook Air‌, both of which vastly outperform prior Intel models without price increases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple will likely sustain its Mac growth as it prepares to introduce even more powerful Apple silicon machines later in the year. Rumors suggest there are upgraded 16-inch MacBook Pro models in the works, plus we're still waiting on a higher-end larger version of the ‌iMac‌. Apple is also expected to introduce a new ‌MacBook Air‌ and a new MacBook Pro, but those might not come until 2022.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/strategy-analytics/\">Strategy Analytics</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/13/apple-notebook-shipments-q1-2021/\">Apple's Notebook Shipments Grew an Estimated 94% in Q1 2021</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-notebook-shipments-grew-an-estimated-94-in-q1-2021.2296038/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZXX4GMH5-Sc:L0xpgl4QOqM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZXX4GMH5-Sc:L0xpgl4QOqM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZXX4GMH5-Sc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07d02c254fdf82cc70f74d9e48cb02caa4e32e5663a4b5938a4c0719d495a73f","category":"Apple"}
