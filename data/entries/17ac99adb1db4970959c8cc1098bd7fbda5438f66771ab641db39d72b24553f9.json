The scheme has a government budget of nearly &#36;1 billion and offers suppliers and manufacturers a cashback for exports.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new scheme, reported today, is aimed directly at boosting the production of IT products such as tablets, laptops, and servers. Apple is reportedly among a group of companies lobbying the Indian government to increase the budget of the new proposal to &#36;2.7 billion, to compensate for the lack of supply chain infrastructure needed to produce IT products, such as tablets and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA source cited by <em>Reuters</em> says that the Indian government \"is asking Apple to get iPads assembled by its contract manufacturers here, the non-Chinese companies.\" Currently, three Apple suppliers operate in the country: Foxconn, Wistron, and Pegatron. Out of the three, it's not clear which one would be responsible for producing the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or which &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model would be produced.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA report by <em>Nikkei Asia</em> last month reported <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/apple-iphone-ipad-production-india-vietnam/\">similar ambitions</a> by Apple to increase local production of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and Mac in India. The report cited production beginning as early as the middle of this year, which seems to line up with the expected announcement of the new Indian PLI scheme.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA number of Apple suppliers have already begun operations in India. Last year, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; supplier Pegatron <a href=\"https://wwwmacrumors.com/2020/11/23/iphone-pegatron-150m-investment-india/\">reportedly</a> increased its investment in India to &#36;150 million, and an earlier report cited that Apple may be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/11/apple-moving-more-production-china-to-india/\">planning to produce</a> up to &#36;40 billion worth of smartphones in the country.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite the efforts by the tech-giant to boost the production of products outside of China and into India, recent riots have put a dampener on the pace of those efforts. In December, workers at a factory owned by supplier Wistron <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/indian-workers-ransack-wistron-iphone-plant/\">went on a rampage</a>, ransacking and damaging the site over claims of unpaid wages. In response, Apple placed the supplier <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/21/apple-places-supplier-wistron-on-probation/\">on probation</a> and found that it had violated its \"Supplier Code of Conduct.\" Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-wistron-working-restart-india-plant/\">has yet</a> to remove the supplier from probation.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-lobbies-india-ipad-production/\">Apple Lobbies Indian Government to Begin Local iPad Production</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-lobbies-indian-government-to-begin-local-ipad-production.2285171/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1jylutaGqM0:wMGH3hqx30M:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1jylutaGqM0:wMGH3hqx30M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1jylutaGqM0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17ac99adb1db4970959c8cc1098bd7fbda5438f66771ab641db39d72b24553f9","category":"Apple"}
