The MLB app now requires an Apple TV HD or Apple TV 4K.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/mlb-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786368\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile the MLB has not provided a reason for the app being removed, the third-generation Apple TV was released in 2012, making it quite old. A few other popular apps are being removed from the third-generation Apple TV as of this month, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/youtube-apple-tv-third-generation/\">including YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/\">CBS All Access</a>, the latter of which is being rebranded as Paramount+.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAirPlay remains available for streaming content from an iPhone or iPad to the third-generation Apple TV, although one Twitter user said that AirPlay was not working for the MLB app, so your mileage may vary.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMLB will begin its 2021 season on April 1, with Spring Training underway now.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, Nick!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tvos-14/\">tvOS 14</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mlb/\">MLB</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/mlb-app-removed-on-third-gen-apple-tv/\">MLB App No Longer Available on Third-Generation Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mlb-app-no-longer-available-on-third-generation-apple-tv.2286779/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NO5PSd0nLAE:TTSzqEnEHuk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NO5PSd0nLAE:TTSzqEnEHuk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NO5PSd0nLAE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8c3e0db623a314a74419643b17efbc4aaf92aeae80e36d2f757b0c2942aa83f5","category":"Apple"}
