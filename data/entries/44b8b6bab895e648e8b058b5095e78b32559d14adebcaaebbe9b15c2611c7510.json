Through a number of component choices, some less obvious than others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.electricrider.co.uk/products/dawes-cycles-falcon-serene-36v-electric-bike-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Falcon Serene now from Electric Rider</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The most obvious area where Falcon is watching the budget is the frame. While most bike manufacturers use aluminium, Falcon has stuck with old-fashioned steel.</p>\n<p>This is one reason why the Serene weighs in at a heftyish 25kg – but then again, the electric motor is there to make riding easier so the extra weight shouldn’t be too noticeable when you’re in the saddle.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/04/falcom_serene_review_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The motor and battery are other areas where Falcon has been able to keep the cost down. Rather than spec a well-known brand, the company has simply selected a generic rear hub-mounted motor and a simple battery that finds a home in the rear rack.</p>\n<p>That rack can also be used to mount a set of panniers or carry a small bag. It may seem a small matter but it’s one that can make a big difference on a daily commute.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the surprising inclusion – given the overall price – of not only a chainguard but also mudguards and a kickstand adds to the everyday usability of the Serene.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.electricrider.co.uk/products/dawes-cycles-falcon-serene-36v-electric-bike-2020\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Falcon Serene now from Electric Rider</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>There’s no doubt compromises have been made to hit the price point, with just six speeds for the derailleur gears, and rim brakes on the generic wheel and tyre package.</p>\n<p>But then again, do you really need lightweight racing wheel and hydraulic disc brakes if you’re only using your bike for short trips around town?</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9543/the-top-10-riders-from-the-2021-spring-classics\">The top 10 riders from the 2021 Spring Classics</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9211/tom-pidcock-and-the-case-of-his-curious-5km-run\">Tom Pidcock and the case of his curious 5km run</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8672/tom-pidcock-wins-baby-giro-ditalia-title-after-dominant-performance\">Tom Pidcock wins Baby Giro d'Italia title after dominant performance</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Falcon Serene specs</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated weight:</td>\n<td>25kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame material</td>\n<td>Steel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Motor</td>\n<td>250W rear hub</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>10Ah</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated range</td>\n<td>40-45km (25-28 miles)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gearing</td>\n<td>Shimano 6-speed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Falcon Comfort</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bars</td>\n<td>Comfort bar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>26in aluminium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyres</td>\n<td>26 x 1.75in</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.falconcycles.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">falconcycles.co.uk</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"44b8b6bab895e648e8b058b5095e78b32559d14adebcaaebbe9b15c2611c7510","category":"Cycling"}
