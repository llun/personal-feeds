Rather than scrubbing through video continually in the direction of the gesture, the video scrubs back and forth in opposite directions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFrom what we've been able to work out, the problem seems to relate to a subtle additional gesture that users are missing out, either because it isn't very intuitive or Apple doesn't demonstrate it particularly well in the marketing material. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/siri-remote-clickpad-video-scrubbing.gif\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTry following these steps to get it working. We've italicized the crucial gesture that users appear to be omitting. \r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>First, pause the video by pressing the Play/Pause button, or by pressing the center of the clickpad ring. (A small preview thumbnail will appear above the playback timeline at the bottom of the screen.)</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Swipe left or right <strong><em>across</em></strong> the clickpad to scrub backward or forward in time. For more granular control, <strong><em>rest your finger on the outer edge of the clickpad ring until a ring icon appears on-screen</em></strong>, then trace a circle with your finger around the clickpad ring in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>To begin playback at the new position, press the center of the clickpad.</li></ol>\r\n<br />\r\nYou should find this method works with Apple's own apps, but we've found inconsistencies in its functioning with third-party apps, especially those that don't use Apple's native playback UI. For instance, it worked for us in Netflix, but the Disney+ app had persistent issues responding to the circular gesture.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Anyone else having weird scrolling behavior with the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleTV4K?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AppleTV4K</a> and â€ŒSiriâ€Œ Remote? When I try to scroll on the new clickwheel it keeps scrolling back and forth. Happens on several apps like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DisneyPlus</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Netflix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Netflix</a> apps.
