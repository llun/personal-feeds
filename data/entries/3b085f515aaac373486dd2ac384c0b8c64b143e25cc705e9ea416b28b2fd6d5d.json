One of the most widely used HFCs, R-134a, causes <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/documents/high-gwp-refrigerants\">1,430 times</a> more warming than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide over 100 years. Another that is commonly used in supermarkets, R-404A, has a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials\">global warming potential</a> of 3,900. Eliminating the use of HFCs worldwide would reduce emissions enough to avoid up to 0.5˚C (0.9˚F) of warming by 2100.</p>\n<p>HFCs were first introduced in the mid-1990s as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were the previous standard for refrigerants. CFCs deplete the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, and decades of use led to a massive hole, discovered in 1974, in the atmosphere above Antarctica. As concern over the ozone hole grew, countries from around the world signed onto the Montreal Protocol, which called for the phaseout of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-environmental-quality-and-transboundary-issues/the-montreal-protocol-on-substances-that-deplete-the-ozone-layer/\">Finalized in 1987</a> and ratified by the US Senate the following year, the treaty is widely seen as a success—as CFC use has dwindled, the ozone layer has begun to repair itself, and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020nasa-data-aids-ozone-hole-s-journey-to-recovery\">by 2040</a>, experts believe the hole will begin to steadily close.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762002#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762002&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b085f515aaac373486dd2ac384c0b8c64b143e25cc705e9ea416b28b2fd6d5d","category":"Tech"}
