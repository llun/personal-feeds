Overall, Apple shipped more than 3.2 million ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ units in India in 2020, up 60% year-on-year.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe results follow several recent moves by Apple in the country, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/apple-online-store-india-launch/\">launch</a> of a regional online store in September 2020 and a Diwali promotion in October that offered free <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> with every ‌&zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj;‌ purchase.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has historically struggled to be competitive in what is the world's second largest smartphone market, in part due to the premium price tags of its ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ models versus the low cost of rival handsets from the likes of Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo that have swamped the market.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, Apple has taken advantage of the Indian government's Made in India initiative to increase its regional manufacturing base, which has allowed it to save import duty costs and pass on the savings to customers by reducing prices on older generation ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple supplier Wistron recently began trial production of the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌‌ at a new facility near Bengaluru, with full production set to begin soon. The ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌‌ will be the seventh ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ model to be manufactured in India, but the first high-end device to do so.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12-Pro\">iPhone 12 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/apple-iphone-12-production-in-india/\">Apple Set to Begin iPhone 12 Production in India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-set-to-begin-iphone-12-production-in-india.2287664/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pD0LQD9Sb_s:MYibLsUk_dM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pD0LQD9Sb_s:MYibLsUk_dM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pD0LQD9Sb_s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"347a0204ff13de56919e3d036582cf0168dc704dfe7abd480c0a4c6d38ad5549","category":"Apple"}
