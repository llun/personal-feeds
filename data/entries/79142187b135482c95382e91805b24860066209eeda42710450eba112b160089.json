{"title":"A music video you can play: Indie rock inside the Unity engine","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747591","date":1615129216000,"content":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>For nearly as long as video games have been around, they've enjoyed a tight relationship with pop music. As early as 1983, Bally-Midway collaborated with Journey to make a game full of licensed songs and the band members' digitized faces (which followed more than a decade of pinball cabinets <a href=\"https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=2579\">featuring</a> megaton <a href=\"https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=438\">bands</a>), and that says nothing of media sensations like \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_ESTnBlS0\">Pac-Man Fever</a>.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, interactive musical experiences, somewhat outside the firm \"gaming\" realm, began emerging in the CD-ROM era. These ranged from simple computer-exclusive content slapped onto a normal album's data track to full-blown multimedia software featuring the likes of <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/JumpBowieCD\">David Bowie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.princevault.com/index.php?title=CD_Rom:_Interactive\">Prince</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus, the synergy of gaming and pop music is littered with various \"firsts,\" and this week, a modest music video by a Texas indie band might not register as a particularly big deal. It's not <a href=\"https://www.myabandonware.com/game/ed-hunter-dbi\">a <em>Doom</em> clone starring Iron Maiden</a> or a hilarious light-gun game starring Aerosmith. But this \"playable\" music video arguably heralds a new era: one where video game engines, and thus a gaming mentality, has become utterly foundational in pop culture.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747591#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747591&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"79142187b135482c95382e91805b24860066209eeda42710450eba112b160089","category":"Tech"}
