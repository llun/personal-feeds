Also, the remote and post are joined with a cable rather than a hydraulic hose, also seen on the Reverb.</p>\n<p>Not only does removing the need for hydraulic internals reduce weight – there’s now “empty space where oil would exist” – it also does away with tight-tolerance sealing, required to keep the oil where it needs to be.</p>\n<p>The seals also increase a post’s weight and add to the amount of friction required for it to raise and compress, which is where the next weight-saving trick from Fox comes in.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The seat clamp is compatible with 7mm and 7×9 Ob-round saddle rails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox</i></span></div>\n<p>A coil spring provides the force required to return the seatpost to its original height. Fox says using a highly preloaded, low-rate coil spring provides enough force to return the post at a quick rate. Had it used a hydraulic system this wouldn’t have been possible.</p>\n<p>Although the brand admits air springs are lighter than coil, it says this is limited to suspension applications where heavier coil springs – in both weight and rate – are required to support rider weight.</p>\n<p>This has also allowed Fox to reduce the amount of sealing required even further.</p>\n<p>The post’s seat clamp is compatible with both 7mm seat rails and 7×9 Ob-round rails.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cutout permits easier cable tension adjustment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Fox</i></span></div>\n<p>The post is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-grx-review/\">Shimano’s GRX</a>-style dropper levers for drop-bar bikes thanks to a window in the post’s body that allows for cable adjustment.</p>\n<p>It’s also available with a 1x mountain bike lever that’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/sram-matchmaker-x/\">SRAM Matchmaker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-grx/\">Shimano GRX</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-i-spec-a-b-and-ii-mounts-explained/\">I-Spec EV</a> compatible.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4a54e99ef4d95d255b0f485deb1ffe165a1e1448a7ecd55a6a85313fbbc5ae60","category":"Cycling"}
