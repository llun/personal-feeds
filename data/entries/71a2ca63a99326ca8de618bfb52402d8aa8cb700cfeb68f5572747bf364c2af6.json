In Belgium, Jumbo-Visma left Gent-Wevelgem with plenty to celebrate, while Ineos-Grenadiers had the same feeling in Spain as they departed the Volta a Catalunya. You&#8217;ll find all this and more in the latest edition of the CyclingTips Daily News Digest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a great week!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt de Neef<br>Managing¬†Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s news?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wout van Aert sprints to Gent-Wevelgem win</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Belgian powerhouse Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) added another top one-day race to his palmares on Sunday with victory at Gent-Wevelgem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert comfortably won the sprint from a lead group of seven; the remnants of a much larger breakaway that came together in the crosswinds with around 175 km of racing still to go. The group thinned out over a series of climbs leaving just a select few to contest the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This victory counts so much to me, it being my first home road race win,&#8221; Van Aert said. &#8220;This sets me up nicely and I can go into the Tour of Flanders next week with lots of confidence.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giacomo Nizzolo (Qhubeka-Assos) sprinted to second ahead of Matteo Trentin (UAE-Team Emirates).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Gent-Wevelgem 2021 - Highlights Men&#039;s Elite 2021 | Cycling | Eurosport\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbgKoX9Qvt4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top five</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

Interestingly, Kopecky and Brennauer finished second and third respectively last year as well (behind Jolien d&#8217;Hoore). Meanwhile Vos&#8217; win was the first-ever victory for the Jumbo-Visma women&#8217;s team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI have to let it all sink in for a while ‚Äì¬†this is a fantastic feeling,‚Äù¬†Vos said. &#8220;It felt like I went too early, but fortunately the tailwind was in my favour. I‚Äôm extremely happy that I was able to finish it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Marianne Vos Continues Jumbo-Visma Domination At Gent-Wevelgem\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD5U3813aSQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top five</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

The British team didn&#8217;t just win overall with new recruit Adam Yates ‚Äì the team swept the podium with Richie Porte second and Geraint Thomas third.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One for the photo album üì∏ <a href=\"https://t.co/qhSix6Y9tV\">pic.twitter.com/qhSix6Y9tV</a></p>&mdash; INEOS Grenadiers (@INEOSGrenadiers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/INEOSGrenadiers/status/1376155836066717700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) won Saturday&#8217;s penultimate stage in what was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/peter-sagan-is-winning-again-just-in-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">his first victory of the year</a>, while the final stage went the way of serial aggressor Thomas De Gendt (Lotto Soudal) who, you guessed it, won solo from the breakaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates, Porte and Thomas all held firm in the bunch in the final days to secure a dominant clean sweep at one of the toughest stage races on the calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top five, GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

The Frenchman swung left in the final kick, pushing Englishman&nbsp;Jake Stewart (Groupama-FDJ)&nbsp;into the barriers. Thankfully Stewart&nbsp;was able to stay upright, but lost his chance of a high placing as a result of the incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stewart later retweeted a¬†<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/nacer-bouhanni-is-still-a-terror/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video of the incident</a>, with a pointed message for Bouhanni. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BouhanniNacer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BouhanniNacer</a> I would ask you what you was thinking&#8230;but you clearly have no brain cells.

The victory is the Italian&#8217;s first since joining Cofidis in January 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jonas Vingegaard wins Coppi e Bartali</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumbo-Visma had more to celebrate this weekend than two wins at Gent-Wevelgem. Over in Italy, Jonas Vingegaard was riding to his first stage-race victory since joining the pro ranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"893\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039-1340x893.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-507888\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039-1340x893.jpeg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039-650x433.jpeg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039-190x127.jpeg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039-1080x720.jpeg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039-16x11.jpeg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CORVOS_00033004-039.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 24-year-old Dane won two stages, both of them uphill finishes, to take and then secure his overall lead. His compatriot Mikkel Honor√© (Deceuninck-QuickStep) was second overall while Australia&#8217;s Nick Schultz (BikeExchange) was third overall after three consecutive third-place finishes to conclude the six-stage race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top five, GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.

ROMO Javier (Astana-Premier Tech) 0:39</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trek-Segafredo and Bora-Hansgrohe sidelined by COVID</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Defending champion Mads Pedersen and his entire Trek-Segafredo team were&nbsp;forced to sit out Sunday&#8217;s Gent-Wevelgem after a COVID positive within the team camp. Bora-Hansgrohe, too, missed the race after rider Matt Walls&#8217; COVID positive which also forced the team from the E3 Saxo Bank Classic on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They aren&#8217;t the only teams affected by COVID in the past week. Lotto-Soudal announced on Sunday that Steff Cras had tested positive on the final day of the Volta a Catalunya. Meanwhile Spanish ProTeam Equipo Kern Pharma withdrew from Catalunya a few days earlier after two team members tested positive for COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sam Bennett&#8217;s big lunch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gent-Wevelgem didn&#8217;t quite end the way Sam Bennett (Deceuninck-QuickStep) wanted it to. The Irishman was well placed in the lead group coming into the final 35 km, but then he was spotted at the back of that bunch, vomiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">üáßüá™ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GWE21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GWE21</a> Sam Bennett (DQT) explic√≥ por qu√© vomit√≥ durante la Gent-Wevelgem:<br><br>üéôÔ∏è &quot;Estoy bien, es mi culpa.

It wasn&#8217;t a great idea. The combination of lactic acid and a too-full stomach meant I vomited. Then I knew that my legs were spent because I had no energy left. I imploded in the final 15km with my race over.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bennett ended up finishing in 55th place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming up ‚Ä¶</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After a busy weekend of racing, there&#8217;s a bit of a lull for the next couple days. We don&#8217;t have long to wait until the next big race though: Dwars door Vlaanderen will be raced on Wednesday. This Belgian one-day is a UCI 1.1 race for the women, and a WorldTour race for the men. After that, it&#8217;s all about &#8216;De Ronde&#8217;. The Tour of Flanders is coming up on Sunday (WorldTour for women and men) and is sure to provide another thrilling day of entertainment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it &#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Jos√© Been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/remembering-antoine-demoitie-five-years-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pays tribute to&nbsp;Antoine Demoiti√©</a>&nbsp;who tragically died after being hit by a motorbike at Gent-Wevelgem five years ago.</li><li>This week‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/bikes-of-the-bunch-a-brandless-8-2-kg-mtb-built-for-less-than-us3000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bike of the Bunch</a>&nbsp;is an ultralight homebuilt mountain bike from Francis Lim.</li><li>That cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal?
