After playing a big part in setting the pace that helped drop those potential rivals, Sagan’s Bora-Hansgrohe team led that reduced peloton through several twists and turns in the finale, helping keep the three-time world champ in a good position ahead of the last few hundred meters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan Sebastián Molano (UAE-Team Emirates) surged to the front with around 400 meters to go but Sagan jumped onto his wheel as the riders arrived at a final sweeping corner, with Molano’s teammate Fernando Gaviria slotting in behind Sagan. Rounding onto the finishing straight with 100 meters to go, Sagan pulled into the lead and he held on through to the finish line to claim the 18th Grand Tour stage win of his career. Gaviria settled for runner-up honors on the day with Davide Cimolai (Israel Start-Up Nation) in third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) finished safely in the peloton to retain his overall race lead.</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>\n                        Giro d'Italia (2.UWT)\n                                                    <span>L'Aquila → Foligno</span>\n                                            </p>\n                    <div>\n                        <div>\n                            <a href=\"/race-result?race=255977\">Full\n                                results</a>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                                            <img />\n                                    </div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                                                    <div>\n                                    <div>\n                                        <span>1</span>\n                                        <div>\n                                            <a href=\"#\">SAGAN Peter</a>\n                                            <span>BORA -
