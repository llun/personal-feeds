This means that the polka-dot jersey only needs to finish the stage to retain the jersey. The stage is also one of the shortest of the 2021 route.</span></p>\n<p><span>The intermediate sprint takes place in Vitré at kilometre 114. Behind the breakaway, the green jersey contenders will all look to gain as many points as possible. Mark Cavendish and Caleb Ewan are just some of the notable pure sprinters that have tried to gain green jersey points so far. Following the IS, just over 35 kilometres will remain until the finish in Fougères. This may deter some of the sprinting teams from going all-in at the intermediate, choosing instead to conserve their full power for the finish.</span></p>\n<p><span>The peloton will enter <span>Fougères </span>from the east side of town. The first key moment in the final kilometres is a left-hand turn at a roundabout with around 2.8 kilometres to go. This will bring the riders to the southern side of town, and with 900 metres to go, the next key turn occurs. This time, it is a right-hand turn which will send the riders into Fougères. There will be a significant battle for position ahead of this corner, which could have a substantial impact on the stage outcome. The finish line is takes place on a minor uphill gradient and kinks slightly to the right, meaning for every sprinter, timing their effort correctly will be key to victory.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20210627TDF1022-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624815789\" /></b><em>Image credit: <span>A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</span></em></p>\n<p><b>Mark Cavendish</b><span> was the winner when a Tour de France stage last finished in Fougères and he has a chance of doing it again six years later. That was his 26th stage victory at the Tour de France, though the ‘Manx Missile’ hasn’t won at the Tour for five years. </span><b>Michael Mørkøv</b><span> is one of the best leadout men in cycling, his presence will only be of benefit to Cavendish’s chances.</span></p>\n<p><span>Alpecin-Fenix have an exceptionally strong sprint team at the 2021 Tour de France. They are led by </span><b>Tim Merlier, Jasper Philipsen </b><span>and </span><b>Mathieu van der Poel</b><span>. Philipsen and Merlier have both won sprint stages at Grand Tours in the last 12 months. Could they both try to win the stage, or will one act as a leadout for their teammate?</span></p>\n<p><b>Wout Van Aert</b><span> has been working for <span>Primož Roglič </span>over the first two stages but has also managed to keep himself towards the pointy end of the general classification. Van Aert won two sprint stages in the first week of the Tour de France last season, and although he lacks a full leadout train, you wouldn’t want to bet against him here.</span></p>\n<p><b>Caleb Ewan</b><span> has gained a reputation as one of the most electric sprinters in world cycling. Roger Kluge and Jasper De Buyst will be tasked with placing him to the front of the race in the final kilometres, and if he's there to compete, the Australian will take some stopping.</span></p>\n<p><b>Bryan Coquard</b><span> has never won a stage at the Tour de France, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a contender for stage four. Just over 100 kilometres separate Coquard’s birthplace (</span>Saint-Nazaire) from the stage finish location in Pontivy, could this be his lucky charm? </p>\n<p><span>Groupama-FDJ are battling for GC with David Gaudu this year, but will direct their focus to former French Champion</span> <b>Arnaud Démare </b><span>who won</span><span> four stages at the Giro d’Italia last season. Groupama-FDJ lost Ignatas Konovalovas when he was caught up in a stage one crash, which hurts Démare's chances as the Lithuanian champion would've played a pivotal role in his leadout train. Despite that, </span><span>Démare</span><span> starts as one of the stage four favourites.</span></p>\n<p><span>The outsiders with a chance include </span><b>Nacer Bouhanni, Michael Matthews </b><span>and </span><b>Sonny Colbrelli</b><span>.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Cover image: A.S.O./<span>Pauline Ballet</span></span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"a4ccf47164b301b891bc6d9fe0e7ca533276a0131d066dbd0a4c6c7b4222a515","category":"Cycling"}
