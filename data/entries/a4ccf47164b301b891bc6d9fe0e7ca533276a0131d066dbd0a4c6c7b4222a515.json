This means that Ide Schelling only needs to finish the stage to retain the polka-dot jersey. The stage is also one of the shortest of the 2021 route.</span></p>\n<p><span>The intermediate sprint takes place in Vitré at kilometre 114. Behind the breakaway, the green jersey contenders will all look to gain as many points as possible. Following the IS, just over 35 kilometres will remain until the finish in Fougères. This may deter some of the sprinting teams from going all-in so close to the end, choosing instead to conserve their full power for the finish.</span></p>\n<p><span>The peloton will enter <span>Fougères </span>from the east side of town. The first key moment in the final kilometres is a left-hand turn at a roundabout with around 2.8 kilometres to go. This will bring the riders to the southern side of town, and with 900 metres to go, the next key turn occurs. This time, it is a right-handed which will send the riders into Fougères. There will be a significant battle for position ahead of this corner, which could have a substantial impact on the stage outcome. The finish line is on a minor uphill gradient and kinks slightly to the right, meaning for every sprinter, timing their effort correctly will be key to victory.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20210627TDF1022-A.S.O._Pauline_Ballet-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624815789\" /></b><em>Image credit: <span>A.S.O./Pauline Ballet</span></em></p>\n<p>Many of the stage three favourites were taken out of contention before the final kilometres on stage three. Firstly, we hope that all riders will make it to the finish without being upended in a crash.</p>\n<p><b></b><b>Mark Cavendish</b><span> was one of those affected yesterday, denying him the chance of winning a 31st Tour de France stage. However, Cavendish was the winner when a Tour de France stage last finished in Fougères and he has a chance of doing it again six years later. That was his 26th stage victory at the Tour de France, though the ‘Manx Missile’ hasn’t won at the Tour for five years. </span><b>Michael Mørkøv</b><span> is one of the best leadout men in cycling, his presence will only be of benefit to Cavendish’s chances.</span></p>\n<p><span>Alpecin-Fenix boast an exceptionally strong sprint team at the 2021 Tour de France, which was on full display when <strong>Tim Merlier</strong> won stage two. <strong>Jasper Philipsen</strong> was second as well, though this was partly due to Caleb Ewan and Peter Sagan crashing behind. </span><span>Philipsen and Merlier have both won sprint stages at Grand Tours in the last 12 months. Could they both try to win the stage, or will Philipsen leadout Merlier again? </span></p>\n<p>Although<b> Wout van Aert</b><span> has the abillity to win stage four, he has stated that he will be conserving his energy for the time-trial on stage five.</span></p>\n<p><b>Bryan Coquard</b><span> has never won a stage at the Tour de France, but that doesn’t mean he’s not a contender for stage four. Just over 100 kilometres separate Coquard’s birthplace (</span>Saint-Nazaire) from the stage finish location in Pontivy, could this be his lucky charm? Coquard was one of the riders to crash on stage three, so we wait for news on his condition.</p>\n<p><span>Groupama-FDJ are battling for GC with David Gaudu this year, but will direct their focus to former French Champion</span> <b>Arnaud Démare </b><span>who won</span><span> four stages at the Giro d’Italia last season. Groupama-FDJ lost Ignatas Konovalovas when he was caught up in a stage one crash, which hurts Démare's chances as the Lithuanian champion would've played a pivotal role in his leadout train. Démare was another of the many riders that were brought down before being able to sprint for stage three — if he isn't hurt, he has a chance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another rider to crash was <strong>Peter Sagan</strong>. Sagan looked to be ramping up his sprint, but collided with <strong>Caleb Ewan</strong>. The Slovakian champion jumped to his feet, whilst Ewan lay on the ground. The Australian looks unlikely to start stage four, but we wait for official confirmation. According to Bora-hansgrohe, Sagan suffered a haematoma and cut on his hip, though he should be able to start stage four. Sagan can never be ignored.</span></p>\n<p><span>The outsiders with a chance include </span><b>Nacer Bouhanni, Cees Bol </b><span>and </span><b>Sonny Colbrelli</b><span>.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021-stage-5-preview-the-race-against-the-clock\">Read our full stage 5 preview</a></strong></em></p>\n<h4><strong>Prediction</strong></h4>\n<p>Deceuninck-Quick Step have one of the strongest leadout trains at the Tour, which is largely down to Michael Mørkøv. If the Dane can place the Manx Missile to the front, he has a great chance of victory. Mark Cavendish is our pick to win stage four of the 2021 Tour de France.</p>\n<p><em><span>Cover image: <span>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</span></span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"a4ccf47164b301b891bc6d9fe0e7ca533276a0131d066dbd0a4c6c7b4222a515","category":"Cycling"}
