For third-party advertising purposes, Google collects data that includes location, search history, and browsing history. Google's own marketing data includes all of the above information along with contact info and device identifiers, plus there's even more data collected for analytics, app functionality, and product personalization.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDuckDuckGo claims that Google \"wanted to hide\" the information that it collects, which is why Google took so long to roll out support for App Privacy labels. Most people are likely not surprised at the extent of the data that Google collects, but having it in one spot in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is a stark reminder.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMany of Google's major apps did not start getting privacy labels <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/\">until late in February</a>, even though Apple's rule went into effect in December. Google delayed adding the labels for so long that its apps went more than two months without being updated. Even now, it's been three months since the Google Maps app has been updated, though most other apps have now received App Privacy labels and updates.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser has been the second most downloaded mobile browser in the US (after Chrome) and, as you might expect, doesn&#39;t collect any data that&#39;s linked to you, making it simple to get the privacy you deserve online.<a href=\"https://t.co/QNfnevurRF\">https://t.co/QNfnevurRF</a></p>&mdash; DuckDuckGo (@DuckDuckGo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1371509147481432067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nDuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search and browser option that's available on iOS devices and that can be set as the default search engine option.
