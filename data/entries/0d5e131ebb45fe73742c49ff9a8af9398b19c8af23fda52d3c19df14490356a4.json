The log indicates that the iMac is running macOS 11.2.1, released in early February, but no further details can be discerned.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has previously reported that a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/\">redesigned iMac with an Apple silicon chip</a> will be released later this year. Gurman said the new iMac's design will be inspired by Apple's high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Pro Display XDR</a>, with slimmer bezels around the display, no metal chin below the display, and a flat back.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEarlier this month, Apple announced that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/06/apple-confirms-imac-pro-will-be-discontinued/\">iMac Pro is being discontinued</a>, while 512GB and 1TB SSD upgrade options are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/\">currently unavailable for the 21.5-inch iMac</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/arm-imac-xcode-crash-log/\">Apple Silicon iMac Potentially Surfaces in Xcode Crash Log</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-imac-potentially-surfaces-in-xcode-crash-log.2288645/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Xw52bw-2tQQ:PGUC16uRPWc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Xw52bw-2tQQ:PGUC16uRPWc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Xw52bw-2tQQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d5e131ebb45fe73742c49ff9a8af9398b19c8af23fda52d3c19df14490356a4","category":"Apple"}
