We're still waiting for details from OnePlus, but on the surface, this commitment matches <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/samsung-now-updates-android-for-longer-than-google-does/\">Samsung's update plan</a>, putting OnePlus in a tie for the best Android support timeline. Google, the company that makes Android, is now in third.</p>\n<p>OnePlus is in the midst of a big upheaval, and the future of the company is not entirely clear. For years, OnePlus offered flagship-style smartphones at surprisingly low prices, peaking with the $670 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/oneplus-7-pro-review-the-fastest-best-designed-best-value-android-phone/\">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> in 2019. Since then, co-founder Carl Pei <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/carl-pei-leaves-oneplus/\">left the company</a> in October 2020, which kicked off what seems like a significant shift in strategy. 2021's OnePlus 9 Pro was $969, basically the same price as a comparable Samsung phone. In January 2021, OnePlus said it was merging \"<a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/21/oneplus-and-oppo-reveal-shocking-secret-partnership-that-is-neither-shocking-nor-secret/\">some R&amp;D capabilities</a>\" with Chinese parent company Oppo, and in June 2021, the two companies <a href=\"https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-new-journey-for-oneplus.1454492/\">announced</a> that they were merging completely.</p>\n<p>OnePlus says the new, longer support time is the result of the company merging the development of OnePlus' Android skin, Oxygen OS, with Oppo's Android skin, Color OS. The two skins are generally targeted at different markets, but it doesn't sound like the UIs will be merged. OnePlus says, \"This is a change that you will likely not even notice since it’s happening behind the scenes.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777860#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1777860&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d808842ccab51e28b3b24f120a6df344e1698ff5d3f75b8dda47d4c8f3d9bd0f","category":"Tech"}
