We've seen Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/12/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal-3-months-for-1/\" target=\"_blank\">offer this deal</a> before, but it still represents a $30 savings. (The company typically gives new users one month of service for $1 before bumping the cost up to $15 per month.) Those who currently subscribe or have previously subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate aren't eligible for the discount.</p>\n<p>As a refresher, Game Pass Ultimate pairs Microsoft's Xbox Live Gold service—which is required for online play with most Xbox games—with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/xbox-apes-netflix-with-10-per-month-100-game-unlimited-pass/\" target=\"_blank\">the company's all-you-can-eat</a> Game Pass subscriptions for Xbox consoles and PC for one monthly fee. A membership also includes access to Microsoft's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-gets-free-xcloud-game-streaming-in-september/\" target=\"_blank\">cloud gaming</a> platform (which is out on Android and semi-available <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/xbox-cloud-gaming-service-hits-ios-windows-pcs-in-spring-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">on iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/xbox-game-streaming-app-is-now-live-on-windows-via-a-sneaky-download/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows</a>) and a <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/09/get-ea-play-with-xbox-game-pass-at-no-additional-cost/\" target=\"_blank\">subscription to EA's Play service</a>.</p>\n<p>The general consensus is that Game Pass Ultimate is one of gaming's best deals, and the Dealmaster is inclined to agree. The service's library now <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=fl7OML4te6w&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=dealmaster051321&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames\" target=\"_blank\">covers hundreds of games</a> across genres: there's the expected Microsoft-made series like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/halo-master-chief-collection-is-finally-confirmed-for-pc-will-include-reach/\" target=\"_blank\">Halo</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/forza-horizon-4-is-the-best-open-world-driving-game-you-can-buy/\" target=\"_blank\">Forza</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/gears-5-review-an-obvious-gaming-recommendation-if-you-already-paid-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\">Gears</a>, but there are also titles from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/bethesdas-leap-to-xbox-game-pass-adds-12-classics-morrowind-oblivion-more/\" target=\"_blank\">newly acquired studio Bethesda</a>; major <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/after-years-on-playstation-mlb-the-show-hits-xbox-game-pass-at-launch/\" target=\"_blank\">sports games like <em>MLB The Show</em></a> and <em>FIFA; </em>larger-scale \"triple-A\" games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/destiny-2-finally-feels-like-a-game-i-might-want-to-get-hooked-on/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/review-control-is-remedys-best-game-yet-and-a-ray-tracing-masterpiece/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Control</em></a>, and <em>Outriders</em> (some of which arrive on release day); older classics like <em>Banjo-Kazooie </em>and various <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/final-fantasy/\">Final Fantasy</a> </em>games; and indie gems like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/an-extended-interview-with-subnautica-director-charlie-cleveland/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Subnautica</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/celeste-review-with-amazing-twists-this-2d-game-reaches-such-great-heights/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Celeste</i></a>, and <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2019/4/\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Wilds</a></em>, among many others. Games rotate in and out of the service over time, and you'll get the most out of it if you're constantly looking for new titles to sample. But it's not hard to see the value if you <em>are</em> that type of player (and own an Xbox).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764814#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1764814&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ec23344823b560a467a0afebdc636b2d9319b9856adff903901aba71f66c566","category":"Tech"}
