With this new release, that line has been amended slightly: 'haul more ass, not cargo'.</p>\n<p>Although the gravel bike scene has taken off in the last few years, much of the focus has been on adventure with comfort and baggage facilities prioritised – but not here.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9497/cerv-lo-spero-5-images#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 34</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/0h0alafx2c_five_black_profile.jpg?itok=BGOXHj-A\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>34</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Cervélo says, 'We drew a line in the dirt when we launched Áspero: we brought speed to the gravel world. However, at Cervélo, the engineering is never complete, and each ride is an opportunity to obsess over ways to make riders faster; we search tirelessly for that place where innovation, performance and experience come together.'</p>\n<p><a href=\"/reviews/7898/cervelo-aspero-review\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Read our review of the original Cervélo Áspero here</em></a></p>\n<h3>Áspirational</h3>\n<p>The main upgrade on the Áspero-5 is aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>According to Cervélo, the new frame is both 10% lighter and saves 32g of drag. The brand emphasises both the lack of peloton in gravel racing and the openness of many trails to help justify splashing out on the 5.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/04/a5_southcal_my2021-8287.jpg?itok=iJ5Dc7oW\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Integration has also been embraced with concealed brake hoses and electronic cables making these stunning bikes even cleaner and adding to the philosophy of the brand's engineers: 'If it looks fast, it probably is.'</p>\n<p>There are three models of the Áspero-5: the 'cheapest' has 1x12 Sram Force eTap AXS; up from that is the 2x12 Shimano GRX 815 Di2-specced bike; while the big dog comes with 1x12 Sram Red eTap AXS.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.cervelo.com/en/aspero-5\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Cervélo Áspero-5 now</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>It maintains the Áspero's best bits too, including the TrailMixer chip ensuring consistent handling when swapping between 700c and 650b wheels and clearance for up to 45mm and 51mm tyres respectively.</p>\n<p>The tubeless ready Reserve wheels are carried over, however the top two models have switched to DT Swiss 350 hubs, while the Sram Force-specced bike stays with 370s.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9497/cerv-lo-spero-5-images#17\"><p><span>Image 18 of</span> 34</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/0h0alarx3c_lime_shimmer_detail_3.jpg?itok=fc-7ty_c\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 18 of </span>34</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 113: on sale now!</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9068/thinking-about-a-cycling-holiday-in-2021-cyclist-tours-can-help\">Thinking about a cycling holiday later this year?

There's a leap of over £2,000 from the previous generation with the Force eTap AXS 1 coming in at £8,199, the GRX RX815 Di2 slightly higher at £8,699 and the Red eTap AXS setting you back a cool £10,799.</p>\n<p>All three come with a power meter, top tube storage bag, Prologo Dimension Nack saddle and Panaracer Gravel King SK tyres.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cervelo.com/en/aspero-5\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Cervélo Áspero-5 now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Forget performance though, the most important decision buyers are likely to make is undoubtedly on the colour. There is the choice between a couple of very desirable options. There's the shiny green and red 'lime shimmer' and the similarly glossy purple and green 'purple sunset'. If you like things a little more understated though the frameset is available in the ubiquitous black colourway too.<em> </em></p>\n<p>For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.cervelo.com/en/bikes/gravel\" target=\"_blank\">cervelo.com</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/news/9497/cerv-lo-spero-5-images\">Cervélo Áspero-5 images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/news\">News</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>16 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9497%2Fcerv-lo-spero-5-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Cerv%C3%A9lo%20%C3%81spero-5%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9497%2Fcerv-lo-spero-5-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Cerv%C3%A9lo%20%C3%81spero-5%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9497%2Fcerv-lo-spero-5-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Cerv%C3%A9lo%20%C3%81spero-5%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fnews%2F9497%2Fcerv-lo-spero-5-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/9497/cerv-lo-spero-5-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 34</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/0h0alafx1c_purple_sunset_front.jpg?itok=W482COYv\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/cyclocross-gravel-and-adventure\">Cyclocross, gravel and adventure</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f73a24949f8621831e8c1d44f7fe9a5917ffe7d9583c46753cca0d3d58d91a75","category":"Cycling"}
