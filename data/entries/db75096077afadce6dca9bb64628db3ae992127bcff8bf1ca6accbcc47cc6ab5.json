Adult Swim just dropped the official S5 trailer, showcasing a new round of wacky interdimensional adventures for our favorite belching mad scientist and his wide-eyed, long-suffering grandson.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for prior seasons below.)</strong></p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty\"><em>Rick and Morty</em></a> centers on the adventures of Rick Sanchez, an eccentric, alcoholic scientist who lives with his horse-surgeon daughter, Beth, her husband, Jerry, and grandkids, Summer and Morty. When not ensconced on the family couch or cooking up mad scientist schemes in his lab, Rick frequently takes Morty on zany adventures throughout the multiverse. The series grew out of a short parody film of <em>Back to the Future</em> by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, who also voices the titular characters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753206#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753206&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db75096077afadce6dca9bb64628db3ae992127bcff8bf1ca6accbcc47cc6ab5","category":"Tech"}
