Cycling UK's research found no evidence of this occuring.</p>\n<p>Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns for Cycling UK, said: 'Following our investigation and the positive responses we've received from the UK's ambulance trusts, I am both pleased and relieved to slay these myths.</p>\n<p>'Survey after survey has shown the majority of the UK supports safer cycling and walking facilities, and Cycling UK would encourage councils to continue their good work and not let baseless allegations deter them from building a safer, healthier and greener future for us all.'</p>\n<p>The investigation contacted 12 trusts, with three unable to respond. Only one, East of England Ambulance Trust, reported any concern which involved a barrier-controlled access to a pedestrian area in Cambridge. Upon further investigation the barrier was likely installed in 2018 for counter-terrorism purposes.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8922/sitting-pretty-in-pink-how-tao-geoghegan-hart-climbed-to-the-top\">Sitting pretty in pink: How Tao Geoghegan Hart climbed to the top</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/in-depth/8846/next-big-thing-tao-geoghegan-hart-profile-2013\">Next Big Thing: Tao Geoghegan Hart profile (2013)</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/news/9254/omloop-het-nieuwsblad-wont-be-broadcast-on-eurosport-or-gcn\">Omloop Het Nieuwsblad won&#039;t be broadcast on Eurosport or GCN</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 110: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nFour of the trusts expressed support for new cycling and walking infrastructure: South Central Ambulance Service, Yorkshire Ambulance Service, East Midlands Ambulance Service and London Ambulance Service.</p>\n<p>'The trust does not support withdrawing funding for active travel measures,' the London Ambulance Service said.</p>\n<p>'The trust also engages extensively with the boroughs and Transport for London to ensure changes and traffic schemes (to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and road safety, and promote active travel) reflect our operational needs as an ambulance service.'</p>\n<p>For more information on Cycling UK, the national cycling charity, visit <a href=\"https://www.cyclinguk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">cyclinguk.org</a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"4cf5a541304dfa3442fd2414c3fab7f5d279ef452228d89f6fd5333f0f010a4e","category":"Cycling"}
