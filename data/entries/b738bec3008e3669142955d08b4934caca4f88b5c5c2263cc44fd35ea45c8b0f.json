WhatsApp's <a href=\"https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion\">policy for inactive users</a> states that accounts are \"generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhatsApp first announced its new usage terms early <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/whatsapp-privacy-policy-data-sharing-facebook/\">last month</a>, and the changes at the time were interpreted by many users to mean that the platform would share their messages with parent company Facebook. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn fact, private messages between users will remain end-to-end encrypted, so that they can only be accessed by those in the conversation. WhatsApp also lets users message businesses, however, and the same protections won't apply to those messages. Data in business messages will be able to be used for commercial purposes like ad targeting on Facebook, with some data stored on Facebook's servers.  \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe misperception caused a backlash amongst users of the Facebook-owned platform, causing an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/08/messaging-app-signal-sees-surge-signups/\">exodus</a> to rival messaging apps like Telegram and Signal, both of which were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/28/telegram-let-you-import-whatsapp-chats/\">quick</a> to exploit the situation by coaxing former users with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/signal-messenger-update-chat-wallpapers/\">more mainstream chat features</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhatsApp has since used <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/whatsapp-status-updates-privacy-reminder/\">in-app Status updates</a> to clarify that the update does not affect data sharing with Facebook in terms of user chats or profile information, with the new terms instead applying to those who use the business chat feature.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the weeks leading up to May, WhatsApp will begin to roll out a small, in-app banner (pictured above) that users can tap to re-review the privacy policies. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nTapping the banner will show a more detailed summary of the changes, including further specifics about how WhatsApp works with Facebook. The Facebook-owned company says it will eventually remind users to read the new policy and accept it to continue using the app.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/whatsapp-fate-of-accounts-privacy-policy/\">WhatsApp Reveals What Happens to Users Who Don&#039;t Agree to Upcoming Privacy Policy Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-reveals-what-happens-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-upcoming-privacy-policy-changes.2285595/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rRJ0eDUWFZ8:WIf8HPfeVxg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rRJ0eDUWFZ8:WIf8HPfeVxg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rRJ0eDUWFZ8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b738bec3008e3669142955d08b4934caca4f88b5c5c2263cc44fd35ea45c8b0f","category":"Apple"}
