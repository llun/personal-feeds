From a timing perspective, we believe the current iPhone 13 launch is slated for the third week in September as of now but could push out into early October based on continued product model tweaks.</blockquote>Apple typically announces new iPhones in September, but the entire iPhone 12 lineup was unveiled in October last year, almost certainly due to production-related delays arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the supply chain now in better shape, it wouldn't be too surprising to see Apple revert to a September announcement.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIves also continues to claim that the iPhone 13 lineup <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/wedbush-iphone-13-1tb-storage-lidar/\">could feature a new 1TB storage option</a> and a LiDAR Scanner across all four models, although TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to the two Pro models</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/\">Wedbush</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/iphone-13-release-date-timeframe/\">iPhone 13 on Track to Launch in Late September Based on &#039;Supply Chain Checks&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-on-track-to-launch-in-late-september-based-on-supply-chain-checks.2289198/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DwdiwipRcVQ:a8jYUww0l9g:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DwdiwipRcVQ:a8jYUww0l9g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DwdiwipRcVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"46995d66cd58df1e1c55dee51c0d4b5756df6797aaa984e4d98cf6137a645276","category":"Apple"}
