{"title":"‘Embrace the Grind’","link":"https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/","date":1618364737000,"content":"\n<p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I often have people newer to the tech industry ask me for secrets\nto success. There aren’t many, really, but this secret — being\nwilling to do something so terrifically tedious that it appears to\nbe magic — works in tech too.</p>\n\n<p>We’re an industry obsessed with automation, with streamlining,\nwith efficiency. One of the foundational texts of our engineering\nculture, Larry Wall’s <a href=\"http://threevirtues.com/\">virtues of the programmer</a>, includes\nlaziness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Laziness:</em> The quality that makes you go to great effort to\nreduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write\nlabor-saving programs that other people will find useful and\ndocument what you wrote so you don’t have to answer so many\nquestions about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t disagree: being able to offload repetitive tasks to a\nprogram is one of the best things about knowing how to code.\nHowever, sometimes problems can’t be solved by automation. If\nyou’re willing to embrace the grind you’ll look like a magician.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I greatly enjoyed this piece on its own, but I think it ties in particularly well with the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/non-fungible-taylor-swift\">aforelinked item</a> about <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/non-fungible-taylor-swift/\">Ben Thompson’s column on Taylor Swift’s re-recording</a> of an entire hit album just to have a version she owned the rights to. Who would do that? Painstakingly re-create an entire work of art? Someone willing to embrace the grind.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/embrace-the-grind\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"54347f9a3d88536ad7907f65d5fe8d3f42fd26505d400fe21e6ee01a6332dee5","category":"Tech"}
