{"title":"Apple Glasses Prototype Reportedly Falls Behind 2021 Testing Schedule","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-glasses-no-2nd-prototype-test-yet/","date":1619430891000,"content":"Apple has yet to start testing the second prototype of its rumored AR glasses, bucking the expectations of its supply partners who expected testing to commence in the first quarter of this year, according to a new report.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/arglassesyay.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple is known to be working on a set of augmented reality glasses that look like regular glasses, but which feature lenses with built-in displays that can be interacted with using gestures. The current prototype is said to resemble high-end sunglasses with thick frames that house the battery and chips.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to a <em>DigiTimes</em> report from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/apple-glasses-prototyping-report/\">January</a>, Apple was about to enter the second phase of development of the glasses, with a focus on improving the device's weight and battery life, suggesting they could move into volume production as early as the first quarter of 2022. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, a <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210426PD202.html\">new report</a> from the Taiwanese publication claims that P2 testing has yet to begin, therefore the chance of volume production in Q1 2022 is now unlikely.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>The sources pointed out that after P2, the AR glasses prototype may still need to go through P3 testing, followed by another 2-3 phases of engineering testing before standing a chance of entering volume production.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe supply chain originally estimated that the Apple wearable could start volume production as early as first-quarter 2022, the sources said. But as the P2 testing has yet to begin, the chance of volume production in first-quarter 2022 is looking unlikely, the sources added.</blockquote>A <em>Bloomberg</em> report in January <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/apple-ar-vr-headset-2022-launch/\">described</a> the glasses as \"several years away,\" though Apple had initially been planning to release them as early as 2023. A previous report from <em>DigiTimes</em> suggested Apple's AR glasses would launch in 2021, while Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has said he expects a 2022 launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/14/kuo-apple-glasses-2022-new-ipads-2020/\">at the earliest</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is believed to be working on multiple AR/VR projects, including a headset with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. In an internal meeting, Apple reportedly said the headset may be announced in 2021 and released in 2022, so it sounds like the headset will launch before the glasses. According to today's <em>DigiTimes</em> report, Samsung is still on track to launch a pair of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/leaked-videos-reveal-samsung-ar-glasses/\">rival AR glasses</a> next year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple Glasses</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-glasses-no-2nd-prototype-test-yet/\">Apple Glasses Prototype Reportedly Falls Behind 2021 Testing Schedule</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-glasses-prototype-reportedly-falls-behind-2021-testing-schedule.2293283/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TsVuz4EdSyY:I_db0EOeCpU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=TsVuz4EdSyY:I_db0EOeCpU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/TsVuz4EdSyY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa96016f647fb5c9ff4588bd5779d51475d468bfdeec6656b8d9896a8d619735","category":"Apple"}
