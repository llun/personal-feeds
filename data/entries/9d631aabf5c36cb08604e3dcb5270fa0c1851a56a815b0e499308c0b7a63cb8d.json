The <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210305PD209.html\">full report from <em>DigiTimes</em></a> is now available, and it includes several new alleged details about Apple's plans.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/OLED-iPad-Pro-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2318\" height=\"1304\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786900\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the report, the first of these devices to adopt an OLED display is likely to be a 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, presumably an updated version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. The updated &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is said to be planned to go into production in the fourth quarter of this year with a launch coming in early 2022. In addition to the 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Apple is also said to be considering using OLED displays for the 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and the 16-inch MacBook Pro.<blockquote>The sources pointed out that the first device to come with an OLED panel is likely to be a 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, set to begin volume production in the fourth quarter of 2021 for an official release in 2022.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe US brand reportedly is also considering adopting OLED panels for its 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and 16- to 17-inch MacBook Pro scheduled for release in 2022, but have not made a final decision, the sources noted.</blockquote>While rumors of OLED displays for Apple's larger portables have only recently started to surface, the company has been rumored for some time to be transitioning to mini-LED displays on its iPads and Macs. <em>DigiTimes</em> says that the two display technologies will exist side-by-side, \"each targeting different customer groups.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA number of sources including <em>DigiTimes</em> have indicated that a 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a mini-LED display is coming in the first half of this year, and <em>DigiTimes</em> says 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models coming in the second half of the year will also adopt mini-LED.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/10-9-inch-oled-ipad-early-2022/\">OLED 10.9-Inch iPad Rumored for Early 2022, 12.9-Inch iPad Pro and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Could Follow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-10-9-inch-ipad-rumored-for-early-2022-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-could-follow.2287125/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lwza_-iGo2k:gT9qInu38Sc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lwza_-iGo2k:gT9qInu38Sc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lwza_-iGo2k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9d631aabf5c36cb08604e3dcb5270fa0c1851a56a815b0e499308c0b7a63cb8d","category":"Apple"}
