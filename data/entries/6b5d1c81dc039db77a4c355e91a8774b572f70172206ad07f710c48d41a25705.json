They're priced at $29 each, with a pack of four available for $99. ‌AirTags‌ connect to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> over Bluetooth and can be attached to items like keys and wallets to make them trackable in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtags-in-box.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPaired with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> and 12 models, ‌AirTags‌ have a Precision Finding feature enabled by the U1 chip that makes it easier to pinpoint lost items that are close by, and when an item is far away, it is able to take advantage of the ‌Find My‌ network that uses billions of Apple devices to track down lost items and relay their location.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/airtag-close-up.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers who ordered ‌AirTags‌ on launch day will begin receiving them on Friday, but single orders placed now are set to begin arriving in May, for ‌AirTags‌ that aren't engraved. Adding an engraving or ordering a four pack will result in a June delivery date.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/airtags-arriving-early-to-some-customers/\">AirTags Arriving Early to Some Customers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtags-arriving-early-to-some-customers.2293798/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wJOTSFPiKxo:9-W-16KLhBU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wJOTSFPiKxo:9-W-16KLhBU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wJOTSFPiKxo\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b5d1c81dc039db77a4c355e91a8774b572f70172206ad07f710c48d41a25705","category":"Apple"}
