Now optimized for a 130mm suspension fork, the Pinhoti III also fits a 29×2.6″ or a 27.5×3″ tire, thanks to an asymmetric dropped chainstay and a new CNC-machined titanium chainstay yoke. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-05-at-8.48.36-AM.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Geometry has been tweaked as well, with a slacker head angle, longer reach, and a few other tweaks. Litespeed offers various builds (XTR shown here at a retail of $6,699) and finishing kits, and with all these new updates, the size medium frame comes in at just 1,649 grams (size medium)—a savings of 95 grams over our previous version of the Pinhoti. As with all Litespeed bikes, these are made in Chattanooga, Tennessee. </p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://litespeed.com/products/pinhoti-iii\" target=\"_blank\">Litespeed</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"1181b2560d53ed0cdf22526fb63ee638195136d65b4cf94f9ceb139508f6a7bc","category":"Cycling"}
