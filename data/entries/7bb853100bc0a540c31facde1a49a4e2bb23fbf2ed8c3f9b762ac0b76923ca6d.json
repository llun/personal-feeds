This notebook would very likely be a new high-end MacBook Pro, with Apple rumored to be planning <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a>, but Huberty did not specify.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMacRumors discovered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/16-inch-macbook-pro-regulatory-filing/\">potential battery listings for the next-generation 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> in a Chinese regulatory database earlier this week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHuberty's prediction lines up with leaker Jon Prosser, who <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/wwdc-new-macbook-pro-models/\">said a new MacBook Pro is coming at WWDC</a>. However, supply chain reports from outlets like <em>Nikkei Asia</em> and <em>DigiTimes</em> have suggested that mass production of new MacBook Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/apple-silicon-macbooks-production-report/\">will not begin until the second half of 2021</a>, casting at least some doubt on a WWDC announcement.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne possibility is that the new MacBook Pro models will be announced at WWDC, but not ship until several weeks later. This would be in line with the new iMac, iPad Pro, and Apple TV models, which did not begin arriving to customers until May 21, just over one month after being announced at Apple's Spring Loaded event on April 20.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pro models are each expected to feature a brighter mini-LED display, an improved iteration of the M1 chip, and a new design with a flatter top and bottom. The notebooks are also expected to regain some ports that Apple removed from the MacBook Pro in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/2021-macbook-pro-sd-hdmi-port-kuo/\">including an HDMI port, SD card slot, and a magnetic charging port</a>. Rumors also suggest the Touch Bar will be retired in favor of physical Fn keys.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/katy-huberty/\">Katy Huberty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/morgan-stanley/\">Morgan Stanley</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/new-apple-silicon-macbook-wwdc-morgan-stanley/\">At Least One New MacBook With Apple Silicon 'Likely' at WWDC, Says Morgan Stanley Analyst</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-least-one-new-macbook-with-apple-silicon-likely-at-wwdc-says-morgan-stanley-analyst.2299200/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hvY9Gcj9v40:i-NwjQbLVXY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hvY9Gcj9v40:i-NwjQbLVXY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hvY9Gcj9v40\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7bb853100bc0a540c31facde1a49a4e2bb23fbf2ed8c3f9b762ac0b76923ca6d","category":"Apple"}
