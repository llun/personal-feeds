{"title":"‘Non-Fungible Taylor Swift’","link":"https://stratechery.com/2021/non-fungible-taylor-swift/","date":1618358208000,"content":"\n<p>Long story rendered very short, Taylor Swift does not own the rights to her first six albums, and isn’t happy about that. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-fearless-taylors-version.html\">She faithly re-recorded the entirety of her second album</a>, <em>Fearless</em>, and just released the new version as <em>Fearless: Taylor’s Version</em>. Without breaking any contract or copyright, she effectively rendered the original studio version nearly worthless, because her fans know the deal.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Thompson has a great column on the whole saga, and deftly ties it in with Dave Chappelle’s similar direct-to-fans appeal to retake control over the rights to his seminal <em>Chappelle’s Show</em>. Thompson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This explains <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-taylor-swift-the-future-of-music-is-a-love-story-1404763219\">what Swift got right in 2014</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the\ncasting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the\ncasting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I\nsee this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this\ndates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label\nmeetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating\ndirectly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the\nfuture, artists will get record deals because they have fans — not the other way around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the inverse of Swift leveraging her fans to acquire her\nmasters: future artists will wield that power from the beginning\n(like <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/\">sovereign writers</a>). It’s not that “art is important and\nrare”, and thus valuable, but rather that the artists themselves\nare important and rare, and impute value on whatever they wish.</p>\n\n<p>To put it another way, while we used to pay for plastic discs and\nthought we were paying for songs (or newspapers/writing or\ncable/TV stars), empowering distribution over creators, today we\npay with both money and attention according to the direction of\ncreators, giving them power over everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/13/non-fungible-taylor-swift\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e658f8b03075f8c39c7801396573d968be925a38828df6f5a1f2ee1013e1ff86","category":"Tech"}
