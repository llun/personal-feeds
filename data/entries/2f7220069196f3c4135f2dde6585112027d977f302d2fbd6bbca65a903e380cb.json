Ideally Apple will crack down on <em>all</em> scams, but practically speaking, all that matters is that they identify and eliminate <em>successful</em> scams — and identify the scammers behind them and keep them out of the store.</p>\n\n<p>Developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/\">Kosta Eleftheriou</a> has been righteously leading a sort of indie bunco squad for a few weeks, identifying a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1360146136695152640\">slew</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009\">scams</a> (usually involving apps with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/\">clearly fraudulent ratings</a>, too).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Cracks Down on Apps With ‘Irrationally High Prices’ as App Store Scams Are Exposed’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/19/app-store-bunco-irrational-prices\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2f7220069196f3c4135f2dde6585112027d977f302d2fbd6bbca65a903e380cb","category":"Tech"}
