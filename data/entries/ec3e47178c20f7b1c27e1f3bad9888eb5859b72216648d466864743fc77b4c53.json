{"title":"Apple Files New M1 iPad Pro in Eurasian Economic Database","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/apple-m1-ipad-pro-eec-database/","date":1619692835000,"content":"A little over a week since their announcement, and less than a month before their official launch, Apple has filed the brand new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Pros into the Eurasian Economic Commission database.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/ipad-pro-with-m1-chip.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe filings, seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, include two ‌iPad‌ Pros with multiple model numbers each, likely referring to the 11-inch and 12.9-inch sizes and corresponding WiFi and WiFi/Cellular variants. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne filing includes the model numbers A2377, A2378, A2567, A2588, and A2602, and the second including A2459, A2460, A2461, A2568, A2569, A2589, A2604. The filing indicates all the models run <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a>, but no other information is given.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlongside the new ‌iPad‌ Pros, Apple also curiously filed the fifth-generation AirPort Time Capsule and the AirPort Express, which were both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/\">discontinued in 2018</a>. Filings in the database are typically meant for forthcoming products rather than previously sold and discontinued devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/ipad-pro-airport-eec-filings.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nNotably missing from today's submissions is the redesigned 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, which was announced alongside the new ‌iPad‌ Pros at Apple's \"Spring Loaded\" event earlier this month. UK retailer John Lewis <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/uk-retailer-john-lewis-ipad-pro-launch-may-21/\">has indicated</a> that both the new ‌M1‌ powered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and 24-inch ‌iMac‌ will go on sale on May 21. However, the lack of filings for the ‌iMac‌ in the database today could indicate that the new iMacs could launch a few days later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌iPad Pro‌ and redesigned ‌iMac‌ will be available for pre-order on Friday, April 30.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airport-extreme/\">AirPort Extreme</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airport-time-capsule/\">AirPort Time Capsule</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eec/\">EEC</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/29/apple-m1-ipad-pro-eec-database/\">Apple Files New M1 iPad Pro in Eurasian Economic Database</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-files-new-m1-ipad-pro-in-eurasian-economic-database.2293866/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oRfVIX77aTQ:4a-ejE3UzMM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oRfVIX77aTQ:4a-ejE3UzMM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oRfVIX77aTQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec3e47178c20f7b1c27e1f3bad9888eb5859b72216648d466864743fc77b4c53","category":"Apple"}
