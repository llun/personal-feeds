Did it work the first time? Chances are, you and your customers have struggled with formatting data in Excel, mapping CSV headers, or correcting invalid fields. This process of importing B2B data is known as <em>data onboarding</em>. And it’s been isolated from innovation. Flatfile, the data onboarding platform, intuitively makes sense of the jumbled data your users import, and transforms it into the format you rely on.\n​​\nNo touchy CSV templates. No building a clunky data importer. No expensive implementation teams hired to migrate data. <em>Never open Excel again.</em> <a href=\"https://flatfile.com/product/portal/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=daring-fireball-sponsorship-display_q2-2021-portal-promotion-week-1&amp;utm_content=sponsored-ad&amp;utm_term=cta#get-started\">Get started</a> today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/26/flatfile-poortal\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a5e1fdcd420646e4f43283444c236d746e537e2075e94057a9dca66f0f470dd4","category":"Tech"}
