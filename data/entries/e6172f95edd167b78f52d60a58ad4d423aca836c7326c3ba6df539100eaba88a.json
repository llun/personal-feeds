Imagine if you could search <em>all</em> your code, across every repo, every language, every code host. That’s exactly what Sourcegraph’s universal code search lets you do. Quickly navigate code with contextual hover tool tips that show definitions, references, and usage examples. Construct complex queries and filter code in ways that IDEs and code hosts can’t. Universal code search is a programmer’s superpower. With it you can find and fix bugs, do better code reviews, identify security risks, onboard to a new codebase, and make large-scale refactors. Once you start using Sourcegraph, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. If you’re a developer, you should check it out today.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Sourcegraph’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/21/sourcegraph\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e6172f95edd167b78f52d60a58ad4d423aca836c7326c3ba6df539100eaba88a","category":"Tech"}
