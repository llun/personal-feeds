We've been hard at work on a bucketload of fixes and improvements to everyone's favorite password manager in between episodes of WandaVision, The Rookie, and Ted Lasso. Additionally, in what will surely be the year of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/\">Apple Silicon</a>, we are excited to announce that 1Password now runs natively on Apple's latest processors and hardware. We've been unbelievably impressed at the speed and efficiency of the new &zwnj;Apple Silicon&zwnj; Macs and can't wait to see what form factors roll out next. (Fingers crossed for that new 16-inch MacBook Pro!)</blockquote>According to the release notes for the 7.8 update, the new software also includes multiple bug fixes and performance optimizations.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n1Password 7.8 can be <a href=\"https://1password.com/downloads/mac/\">downloaded from the 1Password website</a> at the current time, but it is not yet available in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/\">Mac App Store</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/1password/\">1Password</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/1password-for-mac-apple-silicon-support/\">1Password for Mac Updated With Apple Silicon Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1password-for-mac-updated-with-apple-silicon-support.2287748/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mZCsUMaUdw0:PGqkOIBLxes:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mZCsUMaUdw0:PGqkOIBLxes:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mZCsUMaUdw0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"59da4a3abd6cddbf23dfa8c56670ff6bb83292c53d03b2534b9144b28c5a8a08","category":"Apple"}
