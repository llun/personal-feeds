The race is run, and we have a winner in the future of quantum computing. IBM, Google, and everyone else can turn in their quantum computing cards and take up knitting.</p>\n<p>OK, the situation isn’t that cut and dried yet, but a recent paper has described a fully programmable, chip-based <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03202-1\">optical quantum computer</a>. That idea presses all my buttons, and until someone restarts me, I will talk of nothing else.</p>\n<h2>Love the light</h2>\n<p>There is no question that quantum computing has come a long way in 20 years. Two decades ago, optical quantum technology looked like the way forward. Storing information in a photon's quantum states (as an optical qubit) was easy. Manipulating those states with standard optical elements was also easy, and measuring the outcome was relatively trivial. Quantum computing was just a new application of existing quantum experiments, and those experiments had shown the ease of use of the systems and gave optical technologies the early advantage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747779#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747779&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chris Lee","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f7032ad6ed8352f41c5dfb40cb78520c52683fd93bafb6e2e36474e10ea7e1bd","category":"Tech"}
