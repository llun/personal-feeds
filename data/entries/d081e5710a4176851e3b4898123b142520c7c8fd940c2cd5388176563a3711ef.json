{"title":"HomePod 15 Beta Software Adds Lossless Audio Support","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/homepod-15-beta-lossless-audio/","date":1626113939000,"content":"Apple today released a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/apple-releases-new-homepod-15-beta-software/\">new beta version</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> 15 software, and it appears that the update introduces Lossless Audio support for the ‌HomePod‌ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/HomePodandMini-feature-orange.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in June, Apple added higher-quality Lossless Audio and Spatial Audio support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-available/\">to Apple Music</a>, but at launch, Lossless Audio was not available on the ‌HomePod‌ or the ‌HomePod mini‌. Apple in a support document clarified that Lossless Audio <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/22/homepod-apple-music-lossless-future-update/\">would come to</a> the ‌HomePod‌ and ‌HomePod mini‌ in the future, and it appears the higher quality audio will be available this fall when the new ‌HomePod‌ 15 software is available to the public.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/12/homepod-software-15-beta-3-brings-lossless-audio-support/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, those who have the ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta software can enable Lossless Audio by opening up the Home app, tapping the Home icon in the upper left corner, selecting \"Home Settings\" and then tapping the user profile.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFrom there, scroll down to \"Media\" and select the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>\" tab, toggling on \"Lossless Audio.\" When playing a song that supports Lossless quality, the ‌Apple Music‌ player will feature a Lossless icon to make it clear that you're listening to the Lossless tier.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not clear if there are other features in the ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta, but the prior updates <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/07/homepod-sudden-failure-complaints/\">have led to complaints about</a> sudden failures and overheating, which may have been caused by the new software.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌HomePod‌ 15 beta is available on an invite-only basis from Apple and it is not widely available to developers or public beta testers.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/homepod-15-beta-lossless-audio/\">HomePod 15 Beta Software Adds Lossless Audio Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-15-beta-software-adds-lossless-audio-support.2304022/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n1_PvY-NLW8:0zd9j-hVEDg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=n1_PvY-NLW8:0zd9j-hVEDg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/n1_PvY-NLW8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d081e5710a4176851e3b4898123b142520c7c8fd940c2cd5388176563a3711ef","category":"Apple"}
