Or tame it? In <em>Valheim</em>, you get to make this choice, and many others, over the span of a lengthy, randomly generated adventure.                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/\"><em>Valheim</em></a> is Steam's latest top-selling, out-of-nowhere indie game, and from some angles, it sure looks the part. Depending on what screenshots you stumble upon, you might get some serious PlayStation 1 nostalgia vibes, with characters, animals, and trees that look straight out of the first '90s <em>Tomb Raider</em> game.</p>\n<p>We've seen this before when it comes to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/valve-lets-you-pay-for-the-beta-with-steam-early-access-program/\">Steam Early Access</a> hits, usually because a game maker spends more time on gameplay and depth, not screenshots. Hence, it's not surprising to notice similarities to other survival-creation fare like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/forget-fortnite-my-son-is-still-obsessed-with-minecraft/\"><em>Minecraft</em></a> and <em>Rust</em>, where glitchy simplicity is part of the charm. But starting and ending with the graphics in this epic, Viking-tinged tale misses the modern-gaming forest for the blocky-voxel trees.</p>\n<p>To understand why the $20 <em>Valheim</em> has surpassed <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715\">the 2 million sales mark in only 13 days</a>, and why its Early Access buyers can't get enough of it, you have to scrape a few hours beneath the comparison-heady surface level. Get that far, and the game's allure becomes clearer. This is a survival game made by people who really like survival games—but don't necessarily like the genre's tedium.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742416#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1742416&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e0940ddd1cfa62f4b0915e1b96c391ffeb2476fee05c94be6f3b6ae7435d51f","category":"Tech"}
