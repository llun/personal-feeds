In a 56-page legal brief, the FTC reiterated its arguments that Facebook's profits have come from years of anticompetitive conduct.</p>\n<p>\"Facebook is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the history of the world,\" the FTC wrote. \"Facebook reaps massive profits from its [social networking] monopoly, not by offering a superior or more innovative product because it has, for nearly a decade, taken anticompetitive actions to neutralize, hinder, or deter would-be competitors.\"</p>\n<p>The FTC's case against Facebook focuses on two blockbuster acquisitions that Facebook made early in the last decade. In 2012, Facebook paid $1 billion for the fast-growing startup Instagram. While Instagram the company was still tiny—it had only about a dozen employees at the time of the acquisition—it had millions of users and was growing rapidly. Mark Zuckerberg realized it could grow into a serious rival for Facebook, and the FTC alleges Zuckerberg bought the company to prevent that from happening.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755456#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755456&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
