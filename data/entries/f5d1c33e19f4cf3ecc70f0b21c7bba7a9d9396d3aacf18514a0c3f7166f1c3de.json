Take full advantage of your current Shimano pedal bodies* with your brand-new Assioma Duo-Shi,&#8221; read the uncovered text. &#8220;Start training with unmatched power accuracy and consistency. *List of compatible pedal bodies”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wording suggests a new Assioma spindle will mate with existing Shimano pedal bodies, rather than try to license the SPD-SL interface under its own brand (which isn&#8217;t surprising since Shimano has been famously resistant to opening up the SPD-SL design to others). This will be music to the ears of many Shimano pedal users who have long hoped for an SPD-SL power meter pedal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;List of compatible pedal bodies&#8221; mention has us thinking about just which Shimano pedals Favero may be able to accommodate, though. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-484311\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Shimano&#8217;s Ultegra R8000 and Dura-Ace 9000 pedals are from different generations of Shimano&#8217;s road groups, but the spindle differences remain to this day.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for example, the Dura-Ace and Ultegra pedals. While the aesthetic distinctions between the pedals have always been noticeable &#8211; yet arguably still subtle &#8211; one major functional difference is the axle assembly, and the minimal space between the inboard side of the Dura-Ace pedal body makes it unlikely Assioma could squeeze its power meter pod in there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s plenty of room with the Ultegra pedal, though, and while we don&#8217;t have a set of 105 pedals here to crack open, on the face of it, the 105 spindle seems similar to the Ultegra. With 105 and Ultegra pedals being amongst the most popular road pedals, it would make sense for Favero to focus on compatibility with these platforms at the expense of Dura-Ace compatibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-484316\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Shimano-105-Ultegra-Dura-Ace-pedals.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Shimano 105 and Ultegra use spindles of the same size, whereas Dura-Ace spindles are quite abit larger. Photo credit &#8211; Steven McAllister</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The leaked photo shows an SPD-SL style interface, but will the Shimano compatible spindle bring power measurement to SPD pedals also? Some Assioma users have hacked their pedals for off-road use with Xpedo&#8217;s MTB pedal body. However, this does void the Favero warranty and so an official off-road solution would be welcomed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-484299\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Favero-leaks-SPD-SL-spindle-power-conversion-5.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Favero for comment on the rumours, but we have not yet received a reply. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This news comes hot on the heels of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/sram-acquires-time-pedal-and-shoe-lines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SRAM&#8217;s acquisition of Time pedals</a> and our discussion on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/cyclingtips-podcast-nelson-vails-and-srams-purchase-of-time-pedals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this week&#8217;s podcast</a> about the possibility of a Time power meter pedal in the near future.
