However, the delay may only be a few weeks.</p>\n<p>Last summer, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/nasa-now-targeting-halloween-2021-for-launch-of-james-webb-telescope/\">set an October 31, 2021</a>, launch date for the $10 billion telescope. The instrument, which is t<span>he largest science observatory ever placed into space, will launch on a European Ariane 5 rocket from a spaceport in French Guiana. </span>Now, however, three considerations have pushed the launch into November or possibly early December.</p>\n\n<p>During a press briefing with reporters on Tuesday, the telescope's director for launch services, Beatriz Romero, said that there are a \"combination of different factors\" to consider when setting a new launch date. These factors include shipment of the telescope, the readiness of the Ariane 5 rocket, and the readiness of the spaceport in South America as well. Romero said she did not expect to identify a new launch date until later this summer or early fall.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768877#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768877&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f84a0085d6e47f58aa5b90d8267bbea4e51c0e16c6a89d91c23bf2b7801667c9","category":"Tech"}
