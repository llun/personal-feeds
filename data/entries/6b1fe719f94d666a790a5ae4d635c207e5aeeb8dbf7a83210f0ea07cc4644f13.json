And it looks like Apple will be moving to OLED displays for the iPad Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3009&amp;xcust=1-1-350025-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Korea-based The Elec</a>, Apple is shoring up the development of an iPad with a 10.86-inch OLED screen, which just so happens to be the same size as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234771/ipad-air-2020-review.html\">the current iPad Air</a>. The publication reports that Samsung will be the sole supplier of the display. Samsung already makes a Galaxy Tab S7 Plus with a 12.4-inch 2800×1752 120Hz OLED screen. The current Air has a 2360×1640 60Hz LED display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elec describes the display as “rigid OLED and thin-film encapsulation (TFE)” with “low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin-film transistor (TFT) and red, green and blue emission layers,” similar to displays used in the iPhone 12. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>An OLED display would be a massive upgrade for the iPad Air, which launched last year with an iPad Pro-like Liquid Retina screen. While the display is fantastic, OLED would bring it closer to the Retina XDR display in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which has superior contrast and brightness, as well as ProMotion technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-generation iPad Air is due to launch in mid-to-late 2022 with a faster processor (likely the A15) and possibly a higher-quality camera with the Center Stage technology introduced with the iPad Pro. According to the report, Apple is also eying OLED screens for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro in 2023. Apple just added mini-LED to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but Apple has struggled to fill orders, with the current shipping delays topping two weeks.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6b1fe719f94d666a790a5ae4d635c207e5aeeb8dbf7a83210f0ea07cc4644f13","category":"Apple"}
