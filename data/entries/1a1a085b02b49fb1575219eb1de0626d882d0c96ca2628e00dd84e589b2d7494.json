But there was more to the\nstory: NASA officials later said it contained a hidden message\nwritten in binary computer code.</p>\n\n<p>Internet sleuths cracked the message within hours. The red and\nwhite pattern spelled out “Dare Mighty Things” in concentric\nrings. The saying is the Perseverance team’s motto, and it is also\nemblazoned on the walls of Mission Control at NASA’s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL), the mission team’s Southern\nCalifornia headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>The parachute’s outer ring appears to translate to coordinates for\nJPL: 34°11′58″ N 118°10′31″ W.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanurai/status/1364232877848883200\">Tonya Fish posted a handy guide on Twitter</a> (also <a href=\"https://github.com/tanyafish/parachute\">available as a PDF</a>) explaining how the code works.

Computers are supposed to be fun.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘The Hidden Message in the Parachute of NASA’s Mars Rover’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/24/nasa-parachute-message\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1a1a085b02b49fb1575219eb1de0626d882d0c96ca2628e00dd84e589b2d7494","category":"Tech"}
