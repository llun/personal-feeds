As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15 percent compared to the equivalent brand new models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-refurbished-m1-13-inch-macbook-pro.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"923\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-785079\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's online refurbished store has the base model 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 chip <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FYDA2LL/A/refurbished-133-inch-macbook-pro-apple-m1-chip-with-8%E2%80%91core-cpu-and-8%E2%80%91core-gpu-silver\">available for &#36;1,099 in the United States</a>, for example, compared to Apple's regular price of &#36;1,299 for this model. This configuration includes the 8-core M1 chip with 8GB of unified memory and 256GB of SSD storage in Silver or Space Gray.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple says refurbished MacBook Pro models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged with a USB-C power adapter and USB-C cable in the box. In our view, a refurbished MacBook Pro is virtually indistinguishable from a brand new model, so this represents a good opportunity for savings. However, keep in mind that third-party resellers may offer better deals over time, so be sure to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_pro\">monitor our deals roundup</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's refurbished Macs are covered by a one-year limited warranty and have a 14-day return policy. AppleCare+ coverage can be purchased as well.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanwgregg\">Ryan Gregg</a>!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/refurbished/\">refurbished</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/refurbished-m1-13-inch-macbook-pro/\">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished 13-Inch MacBook Pro With M1 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-m1-chip.2285813/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=awi9TylLhyg:GrkdX8rAO20:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=awi9TylLhyg:GrkdX8rAO20:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/awi9TylLhyg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d999779a925053736669427c658d5db41b878fbbb92d75c80a550d8f2951c72d","category":"Apple"}
