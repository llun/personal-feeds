These special edition shoes feature Olympic colors overlayed on an all-white upper sole. These shoes feature an Anatomic Wrap design which allows the shoes to conform to a number of foot shapes and sizes, a carbon shield wrap under the closure to help spread out the pressure from the BOA system closure, and come with SOLESTAR insoles, which were specifically designed for the rigors of road cycling. </p>\n<p>To see more about the EDGE+ Road Pro shoes, head on over to <a href=\"https://world.suplest.ch/shop/shoes_all/road_series/road-pro-game-on-ltd/\" target=\"_blank\">Suplest</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"47727e9557c188db262726051ae790d13daaed4dbf705d9dd1ae31a5aefb41bc","category":"Cycling"}
