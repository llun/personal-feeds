It's like Google TV, but for your tablet.                   </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>Google just remembered that Android tablets exist, and the company has announced \"Entertainment Space,\" a new, tablet-exclusive interface that the company says is \"a one-stop, personalized home for all your favorite movies, shows, videos, games and books.\"</p>\n<p>Google's blog post is vague about the details of Entertainment Space. Is Space an app? Is it a new home screen, which would give Google a similar UI to a Fire tablet? Is it a report from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420405/google-entertainment-space-announced-android-tablets\">The Verge</a> that fills in some of the blanks: Entertainment Space is a new home screen <em>page</em>.</p>\n<p>Just like how the Google Discover news feed lives on the left side of a home screen, or how Samsung puts \"Bixby Home\" over there, Entertainment Space will be the new left-most home screen for tablets, replacing Discover. So for apps widgets (and a customizable home screen), you'll have the main home screen page any others you want to add. For media, you have this big custom interface on the left.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762752#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762752&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9591a4b2592a2c6c4c2099654063796952ee85103b6dffe7824dacc3f2085bd","category":"Tech"}
