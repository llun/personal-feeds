The timeframe suggests that the device could be announced by Apple within the next few weeks, or in April at the latest.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/kuo-mini-led-ipad-pro/\">widely rumored for many months</a>. The device would still have an LCD display, but with Mini-LED backlighting for higher brightness, improved contrast ratio, and other benefits. It's unclear if the 11-inch iPad Pro will be updated with a Mini-LED display too, as many rumors have only mentioned the 12.9-inch model, despite the fact the devices are usually updated together.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/03/ipad-pro-5g-a14x-mini-led-2021-rumor/\">faster A14X chip and support for 5G networks</a> on models with cellular connectivity.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMarch is a common month for Apple to announce new or updated products. Apple last updated its iPad Pro lineup in March 2020 with a marginally improved A12Z Bionic chip, an Ultra Wide camera, a LiDAR Scanner, and better sounding microphones.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nChinese leaker \"Kang\" recently suggested that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">Apple plans to host an event on March 23</a>, and while he has a strong track record so far, Apple could of course opt to announce the new iPad Pro with a press release. Other rumored products include Apple's long-awaited AirTags items trackers, a new Apple TV, new AirPods, and more Apple silicon Macs.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/\">Mini-LED</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mini-led-ipad-pro-release-date-rumor/\">12.9-Inch iPad Pro With Mini-LED Display Said to Launch as Soon as Late March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-with-mini-led-display-said-to-launch-as-soon-as-late-march.2287686/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EV6LZd38Zxw:VyyccvSY-FA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=EV6LZd38Zxw:VyyccvSY-FA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/EV6LZd38Zxw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5bc5c6c1f4104148b8e143b9ff361ed8cf188f971bd298188384f7dcf90447f0","category":"Apple"}
