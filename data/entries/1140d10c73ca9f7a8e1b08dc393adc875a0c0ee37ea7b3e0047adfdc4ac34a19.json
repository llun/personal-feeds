Yes, the clocks have changed in the UK and slowly, and hopefully, things are returning towards what was once normal – and we’re thankful for that here at BikeRadar!</p>\n<p>And with sunnier times starting to peek from behind the clouds, we’ve updated our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/beginners-guide-to-cycling-with-kids/\">how to get out riding with kids</a> and have refreshed our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-bikes-a-buyers-guide-to-find-what-you-need/\">buyer’s guide to women’s bikes</a> too.</p>\n<p>If you’re new to cycling and are thinking about heading out in the nicer weather on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bike</a> for the first time, it might be worth checking out our tips on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/how-to-plan-your-first-road-bike-ride/\">how to plan your first ride road</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you’re looking to take a screen break indoors this weekend, the latest episode of our <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/bikeradarpodcast/bikeradarmeets-luisagrappone\" target=\"_blank\">BikeRadar Meets podcast</a> talks to Luisa Grappone, product engineering manager at Hunt wheels. Luisa is an aerodynamics and composite materials expert and has worked on Boeing’s 787 programme, and at 3T and Campagnolo, before joining Hunt in 2017.</p>\n<p>When it comes to reviews, Matthew’s had his hands on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/moots-routt-45-review/\">a rather lovely looking Moots Routt gravel bike</a> and Alex has been giving <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/brakes/disc-brake-systems/trp-dh-r-evo-brakes-review/\">TRP’s DH-R EVO brakes</a> a good squeeze.

The RAM family comes in both full and half-frame versions, as we have here.</p>\n<p>Though the name isn’t particularly snappy, this top-spec version of the RAM comes with a photochromic lens that changes its tint depending on light conditions. The lens has a mirrored finish to reduce glare and UV light transmission, while the colour of the tint itself is designed to improve contrast on the trail (or road).</p>\n<p>You can’t see it (unless it’s not working properly), but the lens has an anti-fog treatment as well as a hydrophobic coating, which should mean that water droplets are more likely to bead up and roll off while you’re riding.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/Alpina-RAM-sunglasses-side-592a1a1.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The lens isn’t overly curved top to bottom.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/Alpina-RAM-sunglasses-arms-e0dcda6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The little rubber tip at the end is nice and comfy on long rides.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/Alpina-RAM-sunglasses-nose-piece-3a0bdc9.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The nose-piece is fairly svelte.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe lens is fairly flat through its vertical plane and isn’t the most curved horizontally either, however optics are good.

The semi-flexible frame allows for an easy swap of lenses, with various being offered by 100%. Handily, the lens shape is the same as the Racecraft2 and Strata2, so there’s cross-compatibility there (and presumably cost-savings for 100%).</p>\n<p>The frames are held in place by a 45mm deep strap that comes with two silicone strips to grip your helmet. It supports triple post tear-offs for the racers among you, and the thick, triple-layer foam around the frame should soak up sweat well if you get pretty hot when riding.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/100-Accuri2-goggles-foam-3f64a64.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s plenty of foam around the lens.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/03/100-Accuri2-goggles-strap-2683a0a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Tear-off ready (just take care where you tear them off, and don’t leave them lying about, okay!)</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nHeavy nose breathers will appreciate the extra contouring around the nose, which hopefully won’t constrict breathing too much, and all the lenses on offer have fog-prevention coatings.

However, once set there’s no reason to adjust it again, normally.\n<p>The head gives two layback positions (- 2 or -10mm) and it measures 245mm long and weighs 242g on my scales.
