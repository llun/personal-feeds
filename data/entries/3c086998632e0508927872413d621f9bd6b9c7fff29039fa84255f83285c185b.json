Parents were also able to use Screen Time for Parental Control purposes, limiting apps and device usage.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince launch, Screen Time has been built directly into the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and no APIs or SDKs have been made available to developers prior to now, which app developers have not been happy with. That's set to change with ‌iOS 15‌. From Apple's <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/\">iOS 15 features page</a>:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Developers can use the Screen Time API in parental controls apps to support an even wider range of tools for parents. The API provides developers with key features like core restrictions and device activity monitoring, all in a way that puts privacy first.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\nAhead of when Apple launched Screen Time, it started <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/28/apple-statement-parental-control-app-crackdown/\">banning many parental control apps</a> that used Mobile Device Management to let parents control iOS devices belonging to their children. The change led to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/29/tim-cook-parental-control-app-mdm-ban/\">antitrust issues</a> for Apple following complaints from developers that made parental control apps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2019, developers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/31/apple-screen-time-api-campaign/\">petitioned Apple</a> to release a Screen Time API that would let them access the same functionalities that are available with the built-in Screen Time feature to level the playing field. Apple may have finally implemented the feature to ease some of the antitrust scrutiny that it is facing from lawmakers in various countries.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/screen-time/\">Screen Time</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-screen-time-api-third-party-developers/\">Apple Makes Screen Time API Available to Third-Party Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-makes-screen-time-api-available-to-third-party-developers.2299648/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NIOhJYOC7VY:ZGmr0n_f1pQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NIOhJYOC7VY:ZGmr0n_f1pQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NIOhJYOC7VY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c086998632e0508927872413d621f9bd6b9c7fff29039fa84255f83285c185b","category":"Apple"}
