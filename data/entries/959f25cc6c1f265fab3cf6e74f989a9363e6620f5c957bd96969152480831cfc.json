The new iMac is just 11.5mm thick and will be available in up to seven vibrant colors depending on the configuration, including green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/m1-imac-colors.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe front of the new iMac has white bezels with a color-matched metal chin below the 24-inch display, and notably, there is no more Apple logo on the front of the machine. For video calls, the new iMac has a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, \"studio-quality\" microphones, and a six-speaker sound system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPowered by Apple's custom M1 chip with an 8-core CPU and up to an 8-core GPU, the new iMac can be configured with up to 16GB of unified memory and up to 2TB of SSD storage. There's also a minimum of two combo Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 ports, with an additional two USB 3 ports on higher-end models. The headphone jack has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/21/imac-tidbits-headphone-jack-wifi-6-ethernet/\">repositioned to the side of the computer</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iMac comes with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-m1-imac-accessories/\">a new color-matched Magic Keyboard that is available with Touch ID</a> for the first time, and there are now color-matched Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad accessories too.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new iMac will be available to order on Apple.com starting Friday, April 30, and it will begin arriving to customers in the second half of May.

The small Tile-like accessory lets you easily track things like your keys, wallet, purse, backpack, luggage, and more in the Find My app on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/f1618938547.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAirTag is equipped with the Apple-designed U1 chip using Ultra Wideband technology, enabling Precision Finding for iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users. This technology can more accurately determine the distance and direction to a lost AirTag when it is in range.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirTags have a white side and a polished stainless steel side, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/airtag-water-rating-battery-life/\">IP67-rated water and dust resistance</a>. Apple says the AirTag is designed for over a year's worth of battery life with everyday use, and it uses a widely available CR2032 watch battery that is user-replaceable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirTag is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/disable-an-airtag-found-moving-with-you/\">designed with privacy and security in mind</a>, with no location data or location history physically stored inside the AirTag and built-in features that discourage unwanted tracking, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAirTags can be purchased individually for $29 each or in a four-pack for $99, and they <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/airtags-orders-now-available/\">went on sale on Friday, April 23</a> ahead of an April 30 launch.

Thunderbolt supports 10Gbps Ethernet, high-performance accessories, and high-resolution displays like Apple's Pro Display XDR. And on cellular models, Apple has added support for 5G.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPricing starts at $799 for the new 11-inch iPad Pro, while the new 12.9-inch model with the XDR display starts at $1,099. Orders begin Friday, April 30, with availability in the second half of May.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also made the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/ipad-magic-keyboard-now-in-white/\">available in a white color</a>. Current 12.9-inch iPad Pro users who own a Magic Keyboard should be aware that the new model is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/new-ipad-pro-compatibility-older-keyboard/\">officially not compatible</a> with last year's Magic Keyboard model due to the increase in thickness of the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>New Apple TV 4K Announced With A12 Bionic Chip and Redesigned Siri Remote</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-new-apple-tv-4k/\">The Apple TV 4K received a spec bump this week</a>, with the updated model sporting a faster A12 chip that enables high frame rate HDR and Dolby Vision video.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-design-clue.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-apple-tv-siri-remote/\">completely redesigned Siri Remote</a> with a physical clickpad that offers five-way navigation, and the clickpad is touch enabled for users who prefer to navigate tvOS with swipe gestures. The remote also has power and mute buttons for a TV, while the Siri button has been moved to the right side of the remote, consistent with modern iPhones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple TV is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-tv-color-balance-feature/\">getting a new Color Balance feature</a>. Starting with tvOS 14.5 and iOS 14.5, users will be able to hold an iPhone with Face ID near their TV and the front-facing camera and ambient light sensor will begin color measurements and automatically tailor the Apple TV's video output to deliver more accurate colors and improved contrast. Apple says this process will result in improved picture quality without adjusting the TV's settings.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new Apple TV 4K can be ordered beginning Friday, April 30, with availability beginning in the second half of May. The new Siri Remote is included in the box, and it will also be sold separately for $59 for use with any Apple TV 4K or Apple TV HD model released in 2015 or later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Apple Launches iPhone 12 and 12 Mini in New Purple Color</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-launching-iphone-12-in-new-purple-color-on-april-30/\">now available to order in a new purple color</a>, with the first orders arriving on April 30.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iphone-12-preorder-purple.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother smaller announcement at this week's Apple Event was the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-podcast-subscriptions/\">introduction of Apple Podcast subscriptions</a>, allowing users to unlock additional podcast benefits such as ad-free listening, access to additional content, and early or exclusive access to new series, with pricing starting as low as 49 cents per month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere's also a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-card-family/\">new Apple Card Family feature</a> that will be available in May, allowing spouses to share accounts and build credit together, and enabling families with members over thirteen years old to share a single ‌Apple Card‌.
