Well, Hustle City thinks it may have just the indoor cycling solution for you.</p>\n<p>Developed by real-life bike messengers from California, Hustle City is said to be “the world’s first open world video game played on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a>”.</p>\n<p>In the game, you’ll be able to “dodge cars, blow stop lights and explore the high stakes, no brakes world of underground bike messengers”, all from the safety of your home.</p>\n<p>Hustle City: Season One contains five episodes (levels) and is now available to pre-order for $19.99, exclusively through the Apple app store, ahead of its release on 5 May.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hustle City marks a different take on indoor cycling apps.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Hustle City</i></span></div>\n<p>You play as protagonist Will Baldwin, and follow “the story of how he climbs the ranks from humble messenger with Hustle City’s Plan B Courier to bona fide megastar”.</p>\n<p>Hustle City says: “You see the world through his eyes, and feel the tarmac through his legs as you fall in love with the world of bike messengers, equipped with friends, foes, punk bands and of course, deliveries.”</p>\n<p>This essentially means taking bike courier jobs and then completing them as quickly as possible, all while avoiding traffic and ignoring red lights. If you don’t avoid the traffic, you’ll crash and lose time.</p>\n<p>The harder you pedal, the faster the protagonist goes, so you also get a good workout in the process.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/Hustle-City_HustleCity_cutscene5-75e6f12.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>In Hustle City: Season One, you play Will Baldwin, on a journey to becoming a bike courier megastar.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Hustle City</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/Hustle-City_HustleCity_cutscene4-beb125f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The game draws inspiration from bike messenger culture and the wider cycling community. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Hustle City</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>How do I play Hustle City: Season One?</h2>\n<p>To play Hustle City you’ll need an iPhone or iPad, a smart trainer and an AirPlay-compatible device (such as a Mac, PC, smart TV, Apple TV, ChromeCast, Roku, etc.).</p>\n<p>Android devices are not currently supported, though the game’s developers say they intend to offer this “in the near future”.</p>\n<p>Just like Zwift and other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling apps</a>, you power your virtual avatar using a smart trainer.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/Hustle-City_HC_Steering-Overlay-75bff97.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=554%2C720\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>You power the protagonist using a smart trainer, and steer with your iPhone mounted to your handlebar.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Hustle City</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/04/Hustle-City_HC_Crash_2-6c5f889.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=554%2C720\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>If you don’t avoid traffic, you’ll crash and lose time.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Hustle City</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nHustle City says that all BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) compatible smart trainers should work with the game, but it has specifically tested the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/wahoo-kickr-smart-trainer-2020-review/\">Wahoo Kickr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/wahoo-kickr-core-review/\">Wahoo Kickr Core</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/tacx-flux-s-smart-trainer-review/\">Tacx Flux S</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/resistance-trainer/elite-suito-review/\">Elite Suito</a> so far.\n<p>As things stand, Hustle City is not compatible with BLE speed sensors or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/\">power meters</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to steer, you’ll need to mount your iPhone/iPad to your handlebar, using either a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-phone-holder/\">bike phone mount</a> or a homemade solution.
