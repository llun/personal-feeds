The app allows users to create their own Bluetooth tags based on the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network by installing an \"AirTag\" firmware image on a Bluetooth dongle.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe app displays the most recent location of a created Bluetooth tag reported by any <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> using Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network that was implemented in iOS 13, plus it shows the location of the tag on a map.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to the security researchers, the created tags send out Bluetooth beacons, which are picked up by nearby iPhones that interpret the sending device as lost. The current geolocation is end-to-end encrypted and then uploaded to Apple, with the OpenHaystack app then downloading the encrypted report from Apple and decrypting it locally on the Mac.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the process of developing this tool, the Secure Mobile Networking Lab researchers also identified a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/\">macOS Catalina</a> &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; vulnerability that was reported to Apple and addressed in a 10.15.7 update <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849\">released back in November</a>. The vulnerability allowed a malicious app to access <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> decryption keys to download and decrypt location reports submitted by the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's iOS 14.5 update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/ios-14-5-beta-3-items-tab-find-my-app/\">includes support</a> for tracking third-party Bluetooth devices in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app using a new \"Items\" tab, which takes advantage of the same &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; protocol used for the Mac app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAt the current time, in-app tracking is limited to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/powerbeats-pro-find-my-ios-14-support/\">Beats headphones</a> and upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/11/belkin-magsafe-charger-find-my-earbuds/\">Belkin wireless earbuds</a>, but in the future, many third-party Bluetooth devices may include &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; integration, making it easier to keep track of them. This system will also be used by Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">own rumored AirTags</a>, which have yet to be released.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/04/security-researchers-find-my-tracking-framework/\">Security Researchers Develop Framework for Tracking Bluetooth Devices Using Find My</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-researchers-develop-framework-for-tracking-bluetooth-devices-using-find-my.2287071/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=G-LrrgCx51A:Z9sRq2yENTA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=G-LrrgCx51A:Z9sRq2yENTA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/G-LrrgCx51A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3239780dcb82a28e6166f983c53e06c3481b5a0f45286fdba1c6ae6ba0098f89","category":"Apple"}
