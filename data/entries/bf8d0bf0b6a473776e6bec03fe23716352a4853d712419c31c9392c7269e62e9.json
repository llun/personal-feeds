The service is also rebooting a variety of Paramount properties like \"Love Story,\" \"Fatal Attraction\" and \"Flashdance.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nStar Trek shows are also set to feature, including existing shows like \"Discovery\" and \"Picard,\" but also new series like \"Strange New Worlds\" and an animated kids series called \"Prodigy.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe company is also planning to bring some 2021 movie releases like \"A Quiet Place Part 2\" and \"Mission Impossible 7\" to Paramount+ 30 to 45 days after they arrive in theaters. Meanwhile, straight-to-streaming movies will include reboots of \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Pet Semetery.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen it launches on March 4, the new Paramount+ app will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/\">not be available</a> on the second and third-generation ‌‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>‌‌ models, but it will be watchable on the fourth and fifth-generation ‌‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌‌ models.
