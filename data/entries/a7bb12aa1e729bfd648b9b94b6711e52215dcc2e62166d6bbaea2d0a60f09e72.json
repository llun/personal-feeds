Actually, that’s not quite right. What Colnago is selling isn’t the digital rendering itself, but rather the right to call yourself the<em> sole owner</em> of the digital rendering, even though it’s available to everyone. For free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a non-fungible token (NFT) – a unique digital asset that cannot be replicated. It is stored on a digital ledger called a blockchain which records the owner of the NFT as the sole, rightful owner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means that literally anyone can look at a picture of the Colnago C64 NFT – there it is! Up the top! – and can even download an MP4 video of the thing swivelling around in digital space – <a href=\"https://www.colnago.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/0001-0450.mp4\">here you go!</a> – and in that sense, you are having <em>some</em> sort of a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you will never <em>own</em> it, despite it being there on your computer, because somebody else has spent thousands of dollars for that privilege. Meanwhile, enormous server farms of computers are humming along, exacerbating the planet’s hasty demise, because somebody wants a digital certificate showing that they own an MP4 of a colourful bicycle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finish us now.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/colnagos-latest-release-is-ultra-lightweight-limited-to-one/\">Colnago’s latest release is ultra lightweight, limited to one</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a7bb12aa1e729bfd648b9b94b6711e52215dcc2e62166d6bbaea2d0a60f09e72","category":"Cycling"}
