In 2017, Russia <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/31/russia-bans-vpns-apple-pulls-apps-china/\">banned VPNs</a> and other software that enables users to gain anonymous access to websites. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple in 2019 complied with the country's law requiring data on citizens to be stored on local servers, and earlier this year it was forced to show iOS users in the country a list of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/01/iphone-setup-russia-government-approved-apps/\">suggested apps created by Russian developers</a> when setting up a new device.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRussia has also targeted apps and services more directly if it considers them to be in breach of local digital laws. For example, Russia tried to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/13/russia-bans-telegram-messenger-service/\">ban</a> encrypted messaging app Telegram after it refused to comply with requests that it hand over the encryption keys that would allow it to access users' data. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMore recently, in March, Russia intentionally slowed down Twitter's internet traffic to punish it for not deleting what it considered to be \"banned content.\" <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/russia/\">Russia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/21/russian-law-force-apple-open-local-offices/\">Russian Parliament Votes to Force US Tech Giants to Open Local Offices or Face Punitive Measures</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/russian-parliament-votes-to-force-us-tech-giants-to-open-local-offices-or-face-punitive-measures.2301701/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oyDGp6sDS0o:RW-sOXnST2Q:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oyDGp6sDS0o:RW-sOXnST2Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oyDGp6sDS0o\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"faa45990b40f901da4659081598caee2488bd3e39d2e390d0e97bc0b3c1ef605","category":"Apple"}
