The best early deal of the bunch is one <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/10/the-12-most-popular-prime-day-2020-deals-as-chosen-by-ars-readers/\" target=\"_blank\">we also saw during last year's event</a>: Prime members who buy <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3vXJdBr\" target=\"_blank\">select Amazon gift cards worth $40 or more</a> will get a bonus $10 Amazon promotional credit applied to their account at no extra cost.</p>\n<p>To get the deal, you'll have to use the code \"GIFTFORPD21\" at checkout or tap the \"Apply code to your account\" button <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wQG1I2\" target=\"_blank\">located on the offer's landing page</a>. You should then see a notice at checkout that confirms your eligibility for the credit, which Amazon will then email to you and apply to your account within two days. The company says you'll have to use the credit before August 8, and the credit itself can't be applied to items sold by third-party vendors on Amazon's store. You can only utilize the offer once per account, and again, the deal is only for Prime members, since Amazon's aim here is to generate more users and sales activity ahead of Prime Day. All that said, if you buy a card for yourself, the deal effectively gives $50 in Amazon money for the price of $40. Amazon says the offer will run through June 20 or while supplies last.</p>\n<p>If you don't feel like taking advantage, though, our weekend deals roundup also has early Prime Day deals on Audible and Amazon Music Unlimited subscriptions, plus good price drops on PlayStation Plus, the recently-released <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/resident-evil-village-review-apparently-good-horror-takes-more-than-a-village/\"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>, wireless Logitech mice, noise-canceling headphones we like, and much more.
