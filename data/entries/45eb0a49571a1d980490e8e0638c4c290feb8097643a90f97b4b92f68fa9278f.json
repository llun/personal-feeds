Now the Mac has a low power mode too, and it does a similar thing: Reduces energy consumption by automatically turning down the screen brightness and system clock speed to save battery life and make your Mac run more quietly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low power mode is available on the MacBook (Early 2016 and later) and MacBook Pro (Early 2016 and later) running macOS Monterey. Here’s how to turn it on:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Launch System Preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Select the <em>Battery</em> pane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. In the left column, click <em>Battery</em>. Check the box for <em>Low power mode</em> if you want to use it while you’re running off of the MacBook’s battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macos-monterey-low-power-mode-battery.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p> Low Power Mode setting while on battery power.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also turn on low power mode when plugged in. In the left column, click <em>Power Adapter</em>. Check the box for <em>Low power mode</em> if you want to use it while your MacBook is connected to the power adapter. Your Mac will presumably run cooler and quieter when enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/macos-monterey-low-power-mode-power-adapter.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>Low Power Mode setting while connected to the power adapter.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There isn’t a quick way to turn on or off Low Power Mode; it’s not available for Control Center or in the Battery menu bar item. Hopefully that will change in a future version of Monterey.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"45eb0a49571a1d980490e8e0638c4c290feb8097643a90f97b4b92f68fa9278f","category":"Apple"}
