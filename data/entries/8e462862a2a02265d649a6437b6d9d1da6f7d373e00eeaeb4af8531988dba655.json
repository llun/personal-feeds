No rockets have ever launched into orbit from UK soil, but now the government is seeking to become both a launch center of Europe and a small satellite manufacturer.</p>\n<p>In choosing ABL Space, Lockheed has chosen a company that has not yet launched a rocket, although its RS1 vehicle is expected to make its debut during the second quarter of this year. Lockheed is an investor in the El Segundo, California-based ABL Space and believes it is on track to succeed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740153#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740153&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8e462862a2a02265d649a6437b6d9d1da6f7d373e00eeaeb4af8531988dba655","category":"Tech"}
