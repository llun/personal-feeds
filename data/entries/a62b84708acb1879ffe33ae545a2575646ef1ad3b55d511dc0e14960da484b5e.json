(credit: Samuel Axon)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>After a multi-month beta period, software company Adobe has publicly released a version of its Photoshop image-editing software that runs natively on M1 Macs like the late-2020 models of the MacBook Air, Mac mini, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/10/adobe-photoshop-ships-on-macs-with-apple-silicon-gains-speedier-selections-filters-and-performance-boosts.html#gs.v8o1o7\">blog post</a> announcing the release, Adobe's Pam Clark claims that Photoshop will now run \"significantly\" faster on M1 Macs. Here's a snippet:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our internal tests show a wide range of features running an average of 1.5X the speed of similarly configured previous generation systems. Our tests covered a broad scope of activities, including opening and saving files, running filters, and compute-heavy operations like Content-Aware Fill and Select Subject, which all feel noticeably faster. Our early benchmarking also shows that some operations are substantially faster with the new chip.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Naturally, Adobe says it plans to continue optimizing and improving the Apple Silicon version of Photoshop. The blog post notes a couple features that didn't make it to this initial public release for the architecture: \"Invite to Edit Cloud Documents\" and \"Present Syncing.\" There are a few others that aren't named in the post, but the post does point out that they're mostly features that were only recently added to other Photoshop builds.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748550#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748550&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a62b84708acb1879ffe33ae545a2575646ef1ad3b55d511dc0e14960da484b5e","category":"Tech"}
