But now the military faces the problem it deferred at the beginning of the so-called “Global War on Terror”—how to operate a connected battlefield in a world where the enemy is very capable in the air, in space, and in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>\n<p>The new holy grail is “Joint All-Domain Command and Control,” or \"JADC2\" (pronounced \"jad-see-two\"). JADC2 is the aggregation of command and control for sea, air, space, land, electromagnetic spectrum, and other cyber-y things. It’s not going to happen overnight. But with the hard-learned lessons of the past few decades and the rise of technologies that can begin to help manage the information overload of the battlefield, JADC2 appears to need a lot less unobtainium that previous integrated battlespace plans were made of.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740213#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740213&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sean Gallagher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"55c36fb42b0df88b30575eb92c9fea2a2c68515eb979eba5e308c2c1ebe02a1b","category":"Tech"}
