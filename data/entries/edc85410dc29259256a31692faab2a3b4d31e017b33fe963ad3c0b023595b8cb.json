In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/apple-releases-macos-big-sur-11-3-beta-3/\">the latest beta</a>, Apple has added game controller emulation for &zwnj;M1&zwnj; devices, allowing a keyboard or the keyboard and mouse combo to function as a game controller.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/game-control-emulation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1382\" height=\"706\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790230\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new game controller feature was discovered by <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser\">MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a>. When running an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app, opening up the preferences brings up a Touch Alternatives and Game Control interface that can be used to make touch-based &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps run better with Mac controls.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWith Controller Emulation toggled on, common game controller buttons are mapped to keyboard keys and mouse buttons. X, for example, is mapped to Q, the direction stick is mapped to WASD, and Y is mapped to E. L1 and L2 can be accessed by pressing Tab and Shift, respectively, and the Space Bar is the A button.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nController Emulation will allow &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; games that have controller support built in to be accurately controlled with a keyboard and/or mouse when those games are played on an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Mac. This feature is designed for those who don't have a game controller, as those who do can just connect a controller to play.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe macOS 11.3 Big Sur beta also includes the aforementioned Touch Alternatives panel for mapping touch-based features like tap, swipe, drag, and tilt to keyboard keys, and it has a feature for making &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app windows larger.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/touch-alternatives-m1-macs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1382\" height=\"808\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-790231\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nController Emulation and Touch Alternatives work independently of one another, and only one of these features can be enabled at a time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs for game controller support, many current controllers from Sony and Microsoft are compatible with &zwnj;M1&zwnj; Macs, and the beta adds support for the latest PlayStation 5 and Xbox One X controllers.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/macos-big-sur-11-3-controller-emulation-m1/\">macOS Big Sur 11.3 Includes Game Controller Emulation for iPhone/iPad Apps on M1 Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-big-sur-11-3-includes-game-controller-emulation-for-iphone-ipad-apps-on-m1-macs.2289234/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ilfrGSSXL8g:u0zitGrKkkY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ilfrGSSXL8g:u0zitGrKkkY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ilfrGSSXL8g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"edc85410dc29259256a31692faab2a3b4d31e017b33fe963ad3c0b023595b8cb","category":"Apple"}
