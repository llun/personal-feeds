And yet we all have our own favourites among this glittering group.</p>\n<p>We’ll be bringing you full reviews of all 32 bikes tested for Bike of the Year 2021.

He’s smitten by the cheaper version of the nine-grand Giant TCR Advanced SL 0. In fact, Ade is in awe of the £4,199 TCR Advanced Pro 1 option we tested for Bike of the Year and I’m a huge fan of this TCR too.\n<p>Ade and I are in firm agreement that Giant’s TCR Advanced Pro 1 package, while not cheap, is of exceptional value. The finishing kit is top-grade, the SLR-1 wheelset is superb and the Ultegra groupset is completed with Giant’s own dual-sided power meter built into the crankset. Ade has a history of training with power meters when riding some of Europe’s toughest sportives.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,199</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.65kg (L)</li>\n<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Advanced-Grade composite</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Advanced-Grade composite</li>\n<li><strong>Gears:</strong> Shimano Ultegra 52/36, 11-30</li>\n<li><strong>Crank:</strong> Giant integrated crank-based Power Pro power meter</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano Ultegra hydraulic disc</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Giant SLR-1 42mm Carbon Disc WheelSystem</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Giant Gavia Course 1 Tubeless 25mm</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Giant Fleet SL</li>\n<li><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Giant Variant composite</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> Giant Contact SL</li>\n<li><strong>Bar:</strong> Giant Contact SL</li>\n</ul><hr /><h2>Cannondale SuperSix Evo Carbon Ultegra</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Cannondale SuperSix EVO was once again a contender for the Bike of the Year title.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Next up it’s our resident ultra-marathon runner and <a href=\"https://www.cyclingplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling Plus</a> magazine’s senior art editor, Steve.

roads in Gran Canaria, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-we-tested-boty/\">where we chose the final winner of last year’s test</a>.\n<p>Now the proud father of two young children, Rob’s priorities have changed somewhat and he’s looking for a bike that’ll be fast but also versatile with it, due to space being at a premium.</p>\n<p>The Rondo HVRT (£4,699) hits the right notes. With its Twin-Tip forks, this clever piece of design can be an aero-road bike with speedy handling or a long-distance endurance bike that’s more stable; a swift switch of wheels makes it a gravel bike par-excellence, too.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,699</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 8.41kg (L)</li>\n<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Gears:</strong> Shimano Ultegra, 52/36, 11-30</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano Ultegra Disc</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Hunt/Rondo Carbon Limitless Aerodynamicist 44 carbon tubeless-ready</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Continental Grand Prix 5000 25mm</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Fabric ALM Ultimate</li>\n<li><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Rondo CF aero</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> Rondo CF</li>\n<li><strong>Bar:</strong> Easton EC70 aero carbon</li>\n</ul><hr /><h2>Boardman SLR 9.4 Rival AXS</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Road-Bike-of-the-year-2021-06-cd0d684.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Boardman SLR has a clean and uncluttered finish, with the classy paintwork also ensuring a great-looking design.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Road-Bike-of-the-year-2021-16-4461286.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Alloy Alexrims are light and help keep the price down.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Road-Bike-of-the-year-2021-13-c36f137.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The SLR combines a smooth and stiff ride with nimble handling, making for a superb all-round ride.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Road-Bike-of-the-year-2021-14-78c2ad2.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Boardman provides much of the SLR’s finishing kit, including the saddle.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/05/Road-Bike-of-the-year-2021-17-0995557.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s plenty of tyre clearance and mounts for mudguards.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThat just leaves my own contender, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/boardman-slr-9-4-axs-disc-carbon-review/\">Boardman SLR 9.4 AXS Disc Carbon</a> (£2,700). It’s the least expensive bike in this final shootout and, next to the Cannondale and Giant, it doesn’t have the same ‘premium’ brand reputation. (Rondo may be a smaller brand, but it does have the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/rondo-hvrt-cf0-review/\">2019 Bike of the Year award</a> under its belt for the original HVRT).\n<p>And yet the Boardman genuinely surprised me. I tested the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/boardman-slr-9-2-disc-review-2/\">mechanical Ultegra-equipped 9.2</a> last year and the chassis, frame and fork combination, drivetrain efficiency and compliant comfort all made for a bike that rides beautifully. That the sub-900g frame and sub-350g fork are respectably lightweight only adds to the charm.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £2,700</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 8.01kg (L)</li>\n<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Fork:</strong> Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Gears:</strong> SRAM Rival eTap AXS (46/33, 10-30)</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Rival hydraulic disc</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Alexrims RXD3 30mm</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Vittoria Rubino Pro Graphene 2.0 28mm</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Boardman SLR</li>\n<li><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Boardman SLR carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> Boardman Elite alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Bar:</strong> Boardman Elite alloy</li>\n</ul><hr /><h2>Ebb and flow</h2>\n<p>I’ve struggled so much to pick an overall Bike of the Year winner. During the online debates, I’ve found myself ebbing and flowing between these four brilliant bikes.</p>\n<p>The Giant TCR’s ride is second nature to me. I love its responsive handling and the way it climbs is out of this world. The Pro 1 package is pricey at £4,199, but believe me when I say that it’s a great-value package.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a> wheelset (which comes set up tubeless with excellent tyres) weighs just 1,452g a pair and alone would set you back £1,200. Add in a carbon seatpost, carbon bar, full mechanical Ultegra groupset, a dual-sided Giant Power-Pro power meter built into the Ultegra crank (which again retails for £800) and you’re getting a serious amount of bike for the money. The Pro 1 is such a complete package that the thought of upgrades should be put far from your mind.</p>\n<p>The Cannondale SuperSix has handling that I tend to judge all other race-style bikes by. It’s a bike that gives me absolute confidence when heading downhill, knowing that it’ll fly through corners holding its line with pin-point accuracy. It also refuses to be flustered on less than ideal surfaces.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> After months of online debate, the BOTY jury finally met in the flesh.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Rondo HVRT is adaptable, versatile and rapid, and in the new Ultegra package with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hunt-aerodynamicist-wheels/\">Hunt’s Aerodynamicist wheelset</a> it’s an impressive package. Add in the Easton carbon bar and Fabric ALM saddle, which on its own retails at a penny shy of £200, and you can rest assured that the Rondo also isn’t in need of upgrades anytime soon. You’ll just want to get your hands on that all-important second set of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">gravel wheels</a> for some guaranteed off-road fun.</p>\n<p>We’ve all come to feel very positive about the Boardman 9.4 SLR. The red-to-black fade paintwork is a great-looking design, and the wireless drivetrain gives the bike a clean and uncluttered finish.</p>\n<h2>The great debate</h2>\n<p>Our online debates centred around me and my three fellow adjudicators arguing their corners. Steve talks about setting PBs on the Evo; Rob dreams of hitting the road one day and gravel the next on the HVRT and Ade enthuses about making the most of his training rides with power measurement on tap, thanks to Giant’s all-in package. I, meanwhile, celebrate the Boardman and its ace in the deck: SRAM’s new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">12-speed wireless Rival AXS groupset</a>.</p>\n<p>We all agreed on the Boardman’s brilliant frame and fork, and that it’d cleverly gone outside of the standard brands and sourced a light, great value alloy wheelset. The Alexrims, which offer tubeless compatibility and a low weight without the price penalty of carbon, help keep the SLR down to more than £1,000 cheaper than its closest finalist.</p>\n<p>The real proof, however, was judging everyone’s thoughts on the bike as a whole. The Boardman has great handling, located in the sweet-spot between endurance stability and a nimble race feel – I compared it to both Cannondale’s sporty Synapse and BMC’s ground-breaking <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/horse-for-the-course-bmc-gf01-for-flanders/\">GF01</a> (which Steve agreed with wholeheartedly as his own bike is a GF01 Disc) in our round-laptop talks.</p>\n<p>The addition of Rival AXS, with its eTap shift logic (right-hand button harder gear, left-hand lighter, both buttons together shifts the front mech) was celebrated as soon as everyone became accustomed to its intuitive, accurate and dependable shifting.</p>\n<p>Ade and I soon delved into the SRAM AXS specifics of the Boardman. Ade has previously spent plenty of time on a Canyon with Red AXS, and one of my own bikes is equipped with Force AXS, so we’re both used to riding with AXS in its more expensive forms. And both of us genuinely couldn’t feel a difference in shifting performance between SRAM’s three Rival, Red and Force AXS groupsets.</p>\n<p>Impressive stuff for the Boardman’s ‘cheaper’ Rival setup and the weight increase for the lower groupset is less than you’d think, only 233g heavier in a similar 2x setup than Force.</p>\n<h2>Things become clearer</h2>\n<p>Every year I say that it gets tougher for us to pick a Bike of the Year winner as the standard of bikes is increasing and improving annually. This year we’ve got a stunning display of bikes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-year/2020-winners-announced/\">Cannondale as the 2020 Bike of the Year</a> currently wears the crown. The Rondo HVRT has form in being the winning bike from 2019. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-year/the-giant-tcr-advanced-2-is-bikeradars-road-bike-of-the-year-2018/\">TCR is also a former champion</a> (in a previous form) from 2018, and each is a deserving winning bike in its own right. If we get hyper-critical – and we really have to – then things become a little clearer.</p>\n<p>The Rondo, with its anomalous attitude in the world of road bikes, has plenty going for it. As we see more and more niches and sub-niches – from race bikes to all-road bikes, aero-road bikes, endurance bikes, gravel bikes, fast-gravel, bikepackers – this polished bike hits so many targets with impressive competence that I’m sure it has versatility as the first marker in its DNA.</p>\n<p>The only downside with the 8.41kg Rondo is that it’s heavier than its rivals (though by no means a porker).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Every year it gets tougher for us to pick an overall Bike of the Year winner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cannondale’s SuperSix Evo Carbon Ultegra takes the (very minimal) criticism we had of the bike last year and makes upgrades using the aerodynamic KNØT stem and matching aero HollowGram KNØT Save bar.</p>\n<p>The new cockpit looks superb and makes the most of the Evo’s internal cable and hose routing to its fullest. The stem, with its cradle design and bolt-thru clamp, still offers rotational adjustment but loses the forward-facing clamp, and the integrated GPS mount unit keeps everything smooth and clean.</p>\n<p>You’re getting the full Evo experience here, in a bike made famous by Cannondale’s pro-tour EF riders. Yet money is an issue. Cannondale has been hit hard by pricing pressures, meaning this Evo has seen increases and, in flat terms compared to the 2020 bike, it’s nigh-on £1,000 more. If you can stretch to the £3,950 price tag you won’t be disappointed, it’s just a lot of cash for most of us.</p>\n<p>The Giant TCR Advanced Pro 1 is also a heap of money at £4,199, but <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-giant-tcr/\">the latest TCR</a> is absolutely the finest race bike Giant has ever produced. You’ve no idea how crushing that feels to someone whose pride and joy is the previous but now-not-quite-as-good model that’s had a huge amount spent on it!</p>\n<p>For the UK, though, I’d like to have seen Giant complete the bike with 28mm tyres rather than the narrower 25s it comes with. Similar to the Cannondale, it offers a pure-race experience with a specification that (besides the slimmer tyres) is nigh-on flawless. Plus, it comes with an accurate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-power-meters-9-tested/\">power meter</a> that’ll help you improve your fitness and riding prowess. These gains come at a price but they are worth it.</p>\n<p>Coming up like a true underdog is the Boardman SLR 9.4. Yes, its three rivals all come with pretty special carbon wheels, hence the jump in price from the SLR’s £2,700 to the Cannondale’s £3,950, Giant’s £4,199, and Rondo’s £4,699. Yet the numbers on the Boardman’s ‘modest’ Alexrims wheels impress as the RXD3 are fully tubeless compatible and weigh in at a very respectable 1,550g a pair.</p>\n<p>This is compared to the Giant’s 1,404g a pair with the same 19mm internal measure, the Cannondale’s just shy of 1,500g weight, and the Hunt wheels on the Rondo tipping the scales at around 1,300g, so they aren’t that far apart for a much lower initial outlay.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the complete bikes, the Boardman’s light sub-900g frame and feathery 350g fork come into play – only the flyweight 7.65kg Giant beats out the Boardman’s 8.01kg weight, with the Cannondale at 8.13kg and Rondo at 8.41kg.</p>\n\n<h2>Deep data dive</h2>\n<p>Weight is only one factor, of course. When it comes to victory, what the Boardman does and does exceptionally well is ride. The handling is swift, so it’s exciting when riding fast, but it never feels unsettled or twitchy. When it comes to gearing, the SRAM Rival AXS controls – and some may call this sacrilege – are simply better than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/shimano-ultegra-r8000-groupset-review/\">mechanical Ultegra</a>, which has long been the benchmark of bikes between £2,750 and £4,500.</p>\n<p>Mechanical Ultegra is superb for cable-operated gear changing, and none of us four could find ourselves justifying upgrading to Dura-Ace, for instance, but Rival AXS is just simply easier to live with. Maintenance is simpler because there’s no complex internal cable routing and the motorised shifting doesn’t deviate because a cable is rubbing, stretched, contaminated or any other external factor. With AXS, the smart electronic brain simply tells the motors in the mechs to move the designated amount.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rival AXS offers fast, accurate shifting without the need for cables.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The app integration that comes as standard with AXS brings the humble bicycle right into the modern data-driven age. It warrants plenty of praise for the way it offers more analysis opportunities for your riding because the app will record a ride with all the usual metrics: speed, distance, moving time, heart rate (if paired with a heart-rate monitor) and full GPS tracking, which it uploads to Strava automatically. It also adds in useful component data.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boardman has great handling that’s located in the sweet-spot between endurance stability and a nimble race feel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>So if you’ve ever wondered how many times you shift gears in a ride, your overall gear usage, or the time and distance you spend in each gear, then you’ll wonder no more.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a power meter (and SRAM <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-rival-axs/\">offers a Rival power meter upgrade for just £230</a>) it’ll add those metrics. If you run a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/pressure-gauge/quarq-tyrewiz-tyre-pressure-monitor-review/\">Quarq TyreWiz</a> (a Bluetooth device that fixes to your tyre valves to measure and transmit pressures) then even tyre pressure is relayed.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Getting a wireless electronic groupset for this price helped set the Boardman apart from its rivals.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The app can also provide both power and heart-rate analysis, so with the AXS app you can take a deep dive into your ride data before learning from it and using it for constructive training improvements.</p>\n<p>The app even helps take the guesswork out of getting the right gear. You can set the bike up in compensation mode, so that when you shift the front mech to the other chainring it’ll automatically shift the rear to put you in the next best gear. Or you can go full-assist and you only need worry about rear mech shifts because it’ll change up or down at the front for you.</p>\n<p>All of this tech was only available previously on SRAM Force- or Red-equipped bikes starting at prices around £7,000 and up. That you can get these kind of tech advancements, that truly offer a better ride experience for much less outlay, is impressive. Especially when bike pricing has been under so much pressure.</p>\n<h2>Underdog story</h2>\n<p>Boardman should be praised for not only taking a leap into the unknown but being one of the first brands to get on board with SRAM’s affordable AXS.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that Boardman was also one of the first brands to use SRAM road components back when mechanical Double Tap launched, as well as the original eTap.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 9.4 scores Boardman’s first overall Bike of the Year win.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It also deserves just as much praise for producing a chassis made from high-grade carbon that’s superbly designed for all-riders, all-year-round with its big tyre clearances and proper mudguard provisions not dimming the excitement of a race bike and the comfort of an endurance machine.</p>\n<p>That you can buy a bike this good to ride, this great-looking and packed with this much value from Halfords, the same place as you can buy a pine-scented dangling tree for your rear-view mirror, is perhaps even more remarkable.</p>\n<p>The British-designed SLR is the epitome of the plucky underdog beating out more established competition, just as its founder Chris Boardman was the plucky time trialist from a small island taking on the world’s best riders back in Barcelona at the 1992 Olympics.</p>\n<p>When it comes to 2021’s Bike of the Year, it’s been a stellar competition and each of the final four could take the overall title. Yet the Boardman SLR 9.4 represents a perfect mix of performance, speed, comfort, agility and prudence to your pocket. In these uncertain times, it’s the bike to buy with your head and your heart.</p>","author":"Warren Rossiter","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f66c6c55066b97c6b1c59501880ad7e6818983114aed2aa0b8e1d52404055326","category":"Cycling"}
