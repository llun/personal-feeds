If the campaign is successful, it will then be available via the Rover Development website.</p>\n<h2>How does the PSIcle work?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The PSIcle sensor provides tyre pressure readings via an NFC chip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rover Development</i></span></div>\n<p>The PSIcle screws into a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">Presta valve</a> stem with the Presta valve core screwing back into the top of the PSIcle.</p>\n<p>Once in place, the PSIcle uses a near field communicator (NFC) chip, which is fitted in its body. The chip is battery-free and relies on the electromagnetic field of compatible Android and iOS smartphones to power it up. It then launches and sends tyre pressure data back to the PSIcle <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/top-5-smartphone-apps-for-cycle-commuters/\">smartphone app</a>.</p>\n<p>Rover Development says there is no delay in readouts, so the sensor can be used while inflating tyres.</p>\n<p>As the smartphone has to be held close to the sensor, you will have to stop cycling and hold your phone next to the valve to get a reading.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The PSIcle fits into existing Presta valves, whether they are part of an inner tube or tubeless valves.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Rover Development </i></span></div>\n<p>For live, on-bike readouts there is the battery-powered <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/tools-kits-and-boxes/pressure-gauge/quarq-tyrewiz-tyre-pressure-monitor-review/\">Quarq Tyrewiz</a>, which also fits a Presta valve. However, the PSIcle might win out for some thanks to its battery-free design and significantly lower price.</p>\n<p>Rover Development also points out that the battery-free design “eliminates extra weight” when compared to sensors that use a battery.</p>\n<p>The company says the PSIcle measures tyre pressure with “extreme accuracy”, claiming the high-pressure version is accurate to +/- 0.7psi while the low-pressure version can measure to +/- 0.06psi.</p>\n<p>If the PSIcle hits its Kickstarter goal, we’ll be sure to get a set in to review to see if these claims ring true.</p>\n<p>Find out more on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roverdev/psicle-sensor\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a>.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b9acdff0185c70501aa13324714f8e3b9cc970caa7d966d63198d767065fe115","category":"Cycling"}
