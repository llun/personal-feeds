But these vibrations are also our best way of getting a clear picture of our planet's internal structure. By watching how the vibrations' paths shift as they encounter different materials, we can get a picture of where different rock layers meet, where rock becomes molten, and more.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we get this picture by waiting for a natural event to produce the seismic waves. In others, we get impatient and set off explosive charges or use a powerful sound-making device. Today, V<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">áclav Kuna and John </span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nábėlek of Oregon State University</span> are describing yet another option: waiting for a whale to float by. Using the songs of passing fin whales, the researchers were able to reconstruct the upper layers of the seafloor off the coast of Oregon.</p>\n<h2>Quite a song</h2>\n<p>The song of a fin whale is not exactly the sort of thing you'd typically describe as musical. It's generally in the area of 20Hz, which sounds more like a series of clicks than a continual sound, and the whales produce it in second-long bursts separated by dozens of seconds. But they are <em>loud</em>. A <a href=\"https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/tf4173\">guidance on hearing risks</a> places danger at any level above 80 decibels and the loudest concerts as hitting roughly 120 decibels. A fin whale's song can be in the neighborhood of 190 decibels, and it typically goes on for hours.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741444#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741444&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cdefe01d389f2a6a98c4dc607bd82db8a714c449ee5857039c9ccf722578ff47","category":"Tech"}
