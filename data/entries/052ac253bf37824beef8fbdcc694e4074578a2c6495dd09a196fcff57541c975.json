Federal officials\nattributed the mistake to human error. […]</p>\n\n<p>The mistake is a major embarrassment for Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose\none-dose vaccine has been credited with speeding up the national\nimmunization program. It does not affect Johnson &amp; Johnson doses\nthat are currently being delivered and used nationwide. All those\ndoses were produced in the Netherlands, where operations have been\nfully approved by federal regulators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Pilot of Ever Given Takes New Job at Baltimore Vaccine Plant”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/31/johnson-and-johnson-screwup\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"052ac253bf37824beef8fbdcc694e4074578a2c6495dd09a196fcff57541c975","category":"Tech"}
