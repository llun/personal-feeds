Kuo said the lenses will bring electronics from the era of \"visible computing\" to \"invisible computing.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/smart-contact-lens.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787409\" /><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em>Mojo Vision smart contact lens</em></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo said the lenses are \"unlikely to have independent computing power and storage,\" suggesting that they might rely on a connection to an iPhone or other device, but he did not offer any further details. Kuo said there is \"no visibility\" for this product currently, so this sounds more like a moonshot prediction rather than a guaranteed product.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's contact lenses could provide a lightweight augmented reality experience without the need to wear glasses or a headset. In simple terms, augmented reality overlays digital information over a real-world view; for example, a person walking in an outdoor shopping plaza could easily view each store's hours of operation. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn the more immediate future, Kuo said Apple plans to release its long-rumored mixed reality headset \"in mid-2022,\" followed by augmented reality glasses by 2025.
