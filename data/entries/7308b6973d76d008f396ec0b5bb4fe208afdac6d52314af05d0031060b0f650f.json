Carbon wheels have gotten incredibly good at the opposite end of the price spectrum, and we make the argument that, unless you’re dripping with cash, it’s awfully tough to justify the price premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, we also chat about Wahoo Fitness’s new Elemnt Bolt GPS cycling computer, which makes us wonder where the company might go from here. A new high-end model sort of makes sense, but a killer budget model even more so.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/c74257e0-deda-49fc-b2ea-551819ac9483.gif\" />     SUBSCRIBE TO THE ‘NERD ALERT’ PODCAST</strong><br />Never miss an episode.
