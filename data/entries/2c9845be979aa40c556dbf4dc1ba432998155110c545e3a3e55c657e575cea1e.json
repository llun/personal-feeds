Bissegger now leads the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14.4 km TT in Gien featured numerous lead changes after Maxime Bouet rolled down the ramp as the first rider on the course. <strong>Rohan Dennis</strong> spent time in the hot seat after setting a strong early time of 17:47. <strong>Soren Kragh Andersen</strong> took the provisional lead for a little while with a time of 17:44. That held up until Roglic set a mark of 17:40, but the Vuelta a España champ would not spend long in the hot seat as Cavagna went six seconds faster for a time of 17:34.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bissegger, however, was three seconds faster than Cavagna at the first time check and maintained a pace just strong enough through the second half of the course to secure the victory and the overall lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, stage 3</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 BISSEGGER Stefan (EF Education &#8211; Nippo) 0:17:34<br>2 CAVAGNA Rémi (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step)<br>3 ROGLIC Primoz (Team Jumbo-Visma) 0:06<br>4 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:09<br>5 KRAGH ANDERSEN Soren (Team DSM) 0:10<br>6 DENNIS Rohan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:13<br>7 LAPORTE Christophe (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits)<br>8 VAN BAARLE Dylan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:14<br>9 LAMPAERT Yves (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:16<br>10 BEVIN Patrick (Israel Start-Up Nation)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10, GC</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 BISSEGGER Stefan (EF Education &#8211; Nippo) 8:37:11<br>2 CAVAGNA Rémi (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step)<br>3 ROGLIC Primoz (Team Jumbo-Visma) 0:06<br>4 MCNULTY Brandon (UAE-Team Emirates) 0:09<br>5 MATTHEWS Michael (Team BikeExchange)<br>6 KRAGH ANDERSEN Søren (Team DSM) 0:10<br>7 PEDERSEN Mads (Trek &#8211; Segafredo) 0:12<br>8 LAPORTE Christophe (Cofidis, Solutions Crédits) 0:13<br>9 VAN BAARLE Dylan (INEOS Grenadiers) 0:14<br>10 LAMPAERT Yves (Deceuninck &#8211; Quick Step) 0:15</p>\n\n\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP7niN-kLjs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n\n\n<h3>Ciccone extends through 2024 with Trek-Segafredo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Giulio Ciccone</strong> has extended with <strong>Trek-Segafredo</strong> through the 2024 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 26-year-old Italian, who counts two Giro d&#8217;Italia stage wins and a Giro king of the mountains title on his career palmares, has been with the team since 2019. He is set to race the Giro alongside Vincenzo Nibali this May and is expected to lead Trek-Segafredo at the Vuelta a España later in the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Woods and Martin will miss Tirreno-Adriatico</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither <strong>Mike Woods</strong> nor <strong>Dan Martin</strong> will start <strong>Tirreno-Adriatico</strong> on Wednesday as originally planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israel Start-Up Nation said on Tuesday that Woods and Martin were not in the final Israel Start-Up Nation roster for the Italian stage race &#8220;because of some late developing health issues.&#8221; According to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/cycling/mike-woods-bronchitis-tirreno-adriatico-1.5942214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CBC</a>, Woods has been sidelined by bronchitis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pogacar: &#8216;Maybe next year it&#8217;ll finally be time for the Giro&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tadej Pogacar</strong> suggested that there is at least some possibility he&#8217;ll race the <strong>Giro d&#8217;Italia</strong> next year in a media appearance ahead of <strong>Tirreno-Adriatico</strong>. The reigning <strong>Tour de France</strong> champ, who is gearing up for another season targeting the Tour, has yet to race the Giro in his career, having started only one Tour and one <strong>Vuelta a España</strong> so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This year I’ll do the Tour de France, Olympics, and probably the Vuelta, so maybe next year it’ll be finally time for the Giro,” Pogacar said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tirreno-Adriatico will mark Pogacar&#8217;s first race in Italy as a pro, and he is aiming high in what will be his third race of the season after he won the UAE Tour and finished seventh at Strade Bianche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m coming here in good shape, I just hope for some solid results and will try for the win,&#8221; Pogacar said. &#8220;We’ve got a great quality team here too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zwift names Pichette and Burgoyne to board</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Patrick Pichette</strong> and <strong>Celeste Burgoyne</strong> have joined the <strong>Zwift</strong> board of directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pichette was the CFO of Google from 2008 to 2015 and is currently Chair of both the Twitter and Lightspeed boards of directors, as well as being a partner at Inovia Capital, which has invested in Zwift. Burgoyne has been with Lululemon since 2006 and is currently in the role of President, Americas and Global Guest Innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We made a commitment to invest in the very best talent to support Zwift’s growth as a brand, so I’m delighted to be in a position to welcome Patrick Pichette and Celeste Burgoyne to our board of directors,&#8221; said Zwift CEO Eric Min in a statement. “Both bring an enormous wealth of experience from their respective fields, covering finance, technology, brand &amp; marketing, retail, eCommerce and fitness. Importantly for us, they are both passionate about our product and share our vision to help support millions of people enjoying an active lifestyle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coming Up …</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be plenty of pro cycling to watch on Wednesday. Paris-Nice continues with a challenging fourth stage that closes out on a first-category climb. Meanwhile, both Tirreno-Adriatico and the Healthy Ageing Tour will be getting underway. Stage 1 of Tirreno-Adriatico starts and finishes in Lido di Camaiore and should be one for the sprinters, while the Healthy Ageing Tour will kick off with a flat first day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In case you missed it &#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Alan Coté takes a look at <strong>patent filings</strong> to find out whether <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/are-cleat-based-power-meters-on-the-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cleat-based power meters</a> might be coming.</li><li>Iain Treloar <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/rapha-explore-powerweave-gravel-shoe-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reviews</a> <strong>Rapha&#8217;s Explore Powerweave</strong> shoes.</li><li>As Ronan Mc Laughlin writes, <strong>Kask&#8217;s</strong> new <strong>Wasabi</strong> helmet offers <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/kask-offers-aero-and-thermoregulation-gains-with-new-wasabi-helmet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">aero and thermoregulation gains</a>.</li><li>James Huang <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/specialized-s-works-prevail-ii-vent-helmet-review-so-much-air/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reviews</a> the <strong>Specialized S-Works Prevail</strong> <strong>II</strong> helmet.</li><li>As Iain Treloar writes, <strong>Remco Evenepoel</strong> has signed a multi-year deal to be <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/remco-evenepoel-is-the-face-of-pizza-hut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pizza Hut Belgium&#8217;s new ambassador</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/bissegger-wins-stage-3-tt-at-paris-nice-daily-news/\">Bissegger wins stage 3 TT at Paris-Nice: Daily News</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"2c9845be979aa40c556dbf4dc1ba432998155110c545e3a3e55c657e575cea1e","category":"Cycling"}
