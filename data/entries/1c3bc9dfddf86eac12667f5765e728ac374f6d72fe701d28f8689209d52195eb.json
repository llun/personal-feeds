In response to\nthis need, some creative companies are transitioning their\noutgoing Chief Executive Officer to the position of Executive\nChairman of the Board. The Executive Chairman position allows the\norganization to leverage the former CEO’s personal client\nrelationships and institutional knowledge while allowing him to\nretain employee rights and benefits, assist in the transition\nprocess, and gradually phase out of CEO responsibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s what Jeff Bezos is doing at Amazon.
