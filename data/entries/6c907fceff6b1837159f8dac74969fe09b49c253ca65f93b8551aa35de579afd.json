Apple's talks with Hyundai have been known since early January when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-hyundai-negotiations/\">Hyundai confirmed</a> that it had held discussions with Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"We understand that Apple is in discussion with a variety of global automakers, including Hyundai Motor. As the discussion is at its early stage, nothing has been decided,\" the company said. Just hours later, Hyundai walked back the statement and eliminated the reference to Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHyundai's announcement and other detailed rumors about Apple's negotiations with the automaker have upset Apple. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, it is not clear if and when discussions between Apple and Hyundai might resume, but there are a limited number of automakers that would be capable of manufacturing vehicles for Apple.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIf talks do resume, it is likely that Apple will end up partnering with Kia to manufacture the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; at Kia's U.S. factory located in Georgia.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has some time to sort out its manufacturing and production plans as <em>Bloomberg</em> in an earlier report said that it will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/07/apple-car-launch-5-to-7-years-away/\">five to seven years</a> before the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; is ready to launch.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-pauses-car-talks-hyundai-kia/\">Apple Pauses Electric Car Talks With Hyundai and Kia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pauses-electric-car-talks-with-hyundai-and-kia.2283502/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DSFBuUNVPUY:ZS_K6XQwv08:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=DSFBuUNVPUY:ZS_K6XQwv08:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/DSFBuUNVPUY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6c907fceff6b1837159f8dac74969fe09b49c253ca65f93b8551aa35de579afd","category":"Apple"}
