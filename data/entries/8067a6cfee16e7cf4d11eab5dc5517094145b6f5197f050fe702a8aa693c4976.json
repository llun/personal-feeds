Google told the site it doesn't know of any software issues, suggesting that all these people are experiencing a hardware failure.</p>\n<p>The problems range from the camera app instantly crashing when it is opened, displaying a black screen, or showing an error message that reads \"Something went wrong. Close and open the camera app again.\" Claims for what exactly is causing the issues are all over the place, but it seems hard to blame a software bug since both the Google camera and third-party apps are affected, and uninstalling updates and factory resets don't fix the problem.</p>\n<p>The main complaint thread on the Pixel Help forums is up to almost <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/3317373?hl=en\">900 replies</a> now. The oldest device, the Pixel 2 seems to be the most affected, but reports for the Pixel 3, 3a, and 4 are out there. Every Pixel camera from the Pixel 2 to the Pixel 5 has the same camera sensor (a Sony IMX363/IMX362), so it's possible they are all affected.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743126#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743126&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8067a6cfee16e7cf4d11eab5dc5517094145b6f5197f050fe702a8aa693c4976","category":"Tech"}
