A nifty alerting tool for you (US/Europe)","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/02/trying-to-find-a-trainer-in-stock-a-nifty-alerting-tool-for-you-us-europe.html","date":1613572435000,"content":"<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/DSC_3160.jpg\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"DSC_3160\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/DSC_3160_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_3160\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>TLDR: You can now get instant alerts when trainers are in stock, </em><a href=\"http://www.dcrainmaker.com/trainer-stock\"><em>go here</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n<p>You know what Iâ€™m surprisingly good at? Pressing the refresh button on the Internet. Seriously, if someone gave me a task to find something in stock, Iâ€™m gonna eventually find it in stock. Albeit, in the least efficient manner â€“ but by gosh, I can refresh a browser like nobodyâ€™s business.</p>\n<p>And in fact, over the last few months I was manually tracking trainer stock for some of the more in-demand units. Things like the Wahoo KICKR, Tacx NEO, Stages Bike, Elite Sterzo Smart, etcâ€¦ I was mostly checking US sites, but also a handful of European sites. From there Iâ€™d drop comments in the comments section of my review, or on Twitter, when things were in-stock. However, that wasnâ€™t super scalable or timely. Mostly just a lot of luck.</p>\n<p>Thus, introducing an automated version of me: <a href=\"http://www.dcrainmaker.com/trainer-stock\">The DCR Smart Trainer Alerting Tool</a> (STAT?). Thatâ€™s not an official name, because Iâ€™m horrible at naming/branding. Itâ€™s just a simple consolidated site that you can go to <strong>and check the stock of various trainers</strong> from various DC Rainmaker partner retailers, and then <strong>set an e-mail alert for a given trainer when itâ€™s in stock</strong>. The frequency of the checking is pretty high, and in my and many other peopleâ€™s testing if you click the link as soon as you get the alert â€“ youâ€™re able to <strong>nab that trainer</strong> (whereas if you wait till after making a pancake breakfastâ€¦not so likely to win).</p>\n<p>In any case, itâ€™s incredibly simple. You go to the <a href=\"http://www.dcrainmaker.com/trainer-stock\">trainer stock page</a>, and then see which units are in-stock. For ones not in stock, you can set an e-mail alert to be notified the second itâ€™s in stock. Note that we automatically check the appropriate stock for your country. Below, you can see the US:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/image-79.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/image_thumb-79.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"574\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Yet when I check from Germany, I see appropriate local prices/stock/options there for the sites Iâ€™m currently checking. Same goes for other European countries:</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/image-80.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/image_thumb-80.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"574\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Simply click that little checkbox to enter your e-mail address and then confirm the sign-up.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s an example of the e-mail alert youâ€™ll get when something is found. Short and to the point (somewhat unlike a typical DCR Review):</p>\n<p><a data-fancybox=\"gallery\" href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/image-81.png\"><img style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2021/02/image_thumb-81.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"722\" height=\"431\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>Right now I track the most popular (and hard to get) smart trainers across three main categories:</p>\n<p>&#8211; <strong>High-end models:</strong> Wahoo KICKR V5/2020, Tacx NEO 2T, Elite Direto XR, Saris H3<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Midrange models:</strong> Wahoo KICKR CORE, Tacx FLUX 2, Tacx FLUX S, Elite Suito<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Wheel-on models:</strong> Wahoo KICKR SNAP, Tacx Flow Smart, Elite Tuo, Saris M2</p>\n<p>And then atop that, two more categories of things:</p>\n<p>&#8211; <strong>Smart bikes:</strong> Wahoo KICKR Bike, Stages Bike SB20, Tacx NEO Bike Smart<br />\n<strong>&#8211; Hard to get trainer accessories:</strong> Wahoo KICKR CLIMB, Elite Sterzo Smart, Saris MP1 Rocker Plate</p>\n<p>Currently, this <strong>service is targeted at US and Europe</strong>, though it also covers Amazon Canada and a few other Amazon country sites. We do plan to expand it, but honestly like anything else, trying not to boil the ocean here in one go.</p>\n<p>Same goes for retailers. Right now Iâ€™m just covering the retailers that support the site here, so that includes Wiggle, REI, Backcountry, CompetitiveCyclist, and Amazon (all Amazon Europe sites are covered). Iâ€™ve got a few more in mind to expand it to perhaps down the road.</p>\n<p>A couple more notables about the alerts:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Your e-mail address is never shared with anyone (period), itâ€™s just used here to notify you of trainer availability for the unit you selected<br />\n&#8211; You can instantly unsubscribe to alerts using the well-labeled â€˜Unsubscribeâ€™ option within the e-mail, at any time<br />\n&#8211; Itâ€™s possible using this service will cause you to spend money on a trainer that may or may not be approved by your partner. If you get in trouble with your partner for buying a trainer without permissionâ€¦thatâ€™s totally on you. Though, I do appreciate your support via the links. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>I initially rolled it out to <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/support\">DCR Supporters</a> about two weeks ago, and then incorporated a pile of feedback from them. And more importantly for a number of people: They snagged trainers and smart bikes theyâ€™d been trying to find for weeks (or longer). Boom!</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes weâ€™re tracking lots of details about the trainers, including stock history and exactly how long every trainer stays in-stock, and even pricing shifts. Itâ€™s something weâ€™ll likely be able to expand to other products down the road, and use in other interesting ways.</p>\n<p>With that â€“ <a href=\"http://www.dcrainmaker.com/trainer-stock\">go forth and enjoy, and good luck finding that smart trainer</a>!</p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"81d0051ca882bb6c033c842652e0f9848053dcaaf5f4f6972e4b3441ca0ab73e","category":"Cycling"}
