The Tag attaches with a strong 1.5 mm stainless steel wire that threads through a metal grommet, while perforated holes in a diamond pattern allow sound to travel from the AirTag's built-in speakers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn included address card or a business card can be slid behind a clear window that's covered by a secure leather flap. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, offering something different to the typical polycarbonate AirTag holders, WaterField Design's more traditional-looking Keychain accessories house the AirTag within a layer of full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather, which protects the tracker while also concealing it from view.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Key-Chain-All-Colors_1800x1800.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe AirTag Keychain has nine small perforations in the raindrop-shaped leather pouch that allow AirTag sound alerts to pass through, and a heavy-duty matte black ring that can hold multiple keys. The accessory can be attached to items with a metal screw fastener. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA Matte black metal screw stud closes the pouch but allows access for battery replacement, and WaterField Design offers the Keychain with a choice of carabiner or 1.5mm stainless-steel cable, with a barrel closure, that threads through a metal grommet to attach to bags, belt hooks, and so on.\r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtag-accessories/\">AirTag Accessories: Keyrings and Holders for Apple's AirTags</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/products/airtag-leather-keychain?tab=Details\">Leather AirTag Keychain</a> is available from May 28 for $25 in Acorn, Black, Blue, and Red, while the <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/products/airtag-leather-luggage-tag\">Leather AirTag Luggage Tag</a> is available from June 9 for $49 in a Black exterior/Black interior, Blue/Black, Crimson/Black, and Grizzly Brown/Black. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/waterfield-designs/\">WaterField Designs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/25/waterfield-designs-leather-airtag-keychain-luggage/\">WaterField Designs Launches Leather AirTag Keychain and Luggage Tag</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/waterfield-designs-launches-leather-airtag-keychain-and-luggage-tag.2297709/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4bbJUBJph1k:W7wLbvlFsEc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=4bbJUBJph1k:W7wLbvlFsEc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/4bbJUBJph1k\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8ca7930117d30e51dbe03fa646a1a8f7fa69dd48cf952999ab0e03b53f92d1bc","category":"Apple"}
