The Massachusetts-born Skerry recalls visiting the beaches of New England as a child and being fascinating by nature documentaries about the ocean. \"There was something especially awe-inspiring about whales,\" he told Ars. \"There are so many secrets. If I spent the rest of my life just [filming] whales, I would be very happy.\"</p>\n<p>Skerry pitched a one-hour documentary to National Geographic about his project, which turned into four hours when producer, writer, and director Brian Armstrong (Red Rock Films) signed on, along with Oscar-winning director James Cameron as executive producer. \"It started off as a photographer profile [of Skerry], but the scope became so big,\" Armstrong told Ars. \"[We realized] it's about the whales and their culture—a big breakthrough topic.
