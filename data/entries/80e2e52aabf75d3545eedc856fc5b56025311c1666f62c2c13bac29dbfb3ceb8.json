Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid\">reports</a> that Tesla is currently building a battery installation in Tesla CEO Elon Musk's new home state of Texas. The project is in Angleton, about an hour south of Houston.</p>\n<p>Tesla hasn't publicized the project, which is operating under the name of an obscure Tesla subsidiary called Gambit Energy Storage LLC. When a Bloomberg photographer visited, a worker discouraged picture-taking and said the project was \"secretive.\" The project appears to consist of 20 large banks of batteries that have been covered by white sheets.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://angleton.tx.us/DocumentCenter/View/3793/Gambit-Energy-Storage-Park-FAQ?bidId=\">document on the city of Angleton's website</a> provides some details about the project. It's listed as being a project of Plus Power but includes a photo of a Tesla battery cabinet. Plus Power counts two former Tesla employees among its executives. Plus confirmed to Bloomberg that it had started the project, then sold it to an undisclosed party.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747865#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747865&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
