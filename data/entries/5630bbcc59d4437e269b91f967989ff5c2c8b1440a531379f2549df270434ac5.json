{"title":"Godzilla vs. Kong review: Kaiju greatness that lives up to its absurd title","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753417","date":1617192540000,"content":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Recently, I've heard the phrase \"pandemic fatigue\" come up in terms of people getting antsy about returning to \"normal.\" I don't know how long we have left to go (though Ars has plenty of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/as-coronavirus-variants-spread-the-us-struggles-to-keep-up\">articles</a> on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/covid-19/\">topic</a>), but I can say that even through my vigilance about safety and health, my own patience sometimes gets seriously tested—especially whenever a hint of normalcy flashes before my eyes.</p>\n<p>One example is watching a bombastic movie that gets me so amped up, it makes me finally dream of going to a movie theater again. And I'm absolutely shocked to admit that the film to test my patience the most in the past 12 months might very well be <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>, out today in theaters and on HBO Max. (Seriously, I am stunned to say this, after <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-film-review-fart-noises/\">what I said about the last official Godzilla film</a>.)</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/godzilla_vs_kong-listing.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Everything I hoped for from a picture like this comes to fruition in <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>—and then some.

This film is a lot like its titular beasts: big, splashy, and sometimes quite dumb on the surface, yet full of animal-like cunning and able to land massive blows at crucial moments.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753417#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753417&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5630bbcc59d4437e269b91f967989ff5c2c8b1440a531379f2549df270434ac5","category":"Tech"}
