With that longterm relationship established and no co-title sponsor to share space in the name any longer, one of Quick-Step’s products will be reflected in the team’s name starting in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A press release described the company’s Alpha Vinyl floors as “rigid, 100%-watertight, ultra-strong vinyl flooring solutions that are almost indistinguishable from real wood or stone.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/deceuninck-quick-step-will-become-quick-step-alpha-vinyl-in-2022/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"724eb82a7fdf31b60482395f02def985e085d79eea2ac10adecdf6aefe0d036b","category":"Cycling"}
