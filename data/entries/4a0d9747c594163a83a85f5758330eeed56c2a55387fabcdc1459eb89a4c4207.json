As crews made landfall on many islands, rats hopped off and made themselves new homes.</p>\n<p>The rats prospered, out-competing, eating, or otherwise driving off native species, and fragile island ecosystems suffered. However, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(21)00477-2\">new research</a> suggests that these remote, isolated ecosystems can bounce back relatively quickly after conservation groups eliminate the rats, a practice that is becoming increasingly common. And the changes caused by the rats’ removal are even felt in offshore ecosystems.</p>\n<h2>Rats actually harm coral</h2>\n<p>Rats are not picky when it comes to food. They’ll happily chow down on fruit, seeds, nuts, insects, and almost anything else they can stomach. This has a notable impact on the islands’ terrestrial habitats. But in a stark yet roundabout way, rats also harm marine habitats.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761169#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1761169&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a0d9747c594163a83a85f5758330eeed56c2a55387fabcdc1459eb89a4c4207","category":"Tech"}
