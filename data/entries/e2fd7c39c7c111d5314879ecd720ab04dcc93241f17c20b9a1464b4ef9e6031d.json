From the <a href=\"https://weatherlineapp.com/blog/weather-line-is-being-acquired\">Weather Line blog</a>:\r\n<br/>\r\n<blockquote>In recent months, we were approached by a buyer. They saw the uniqueness of Weather Line and the strong foundation we’ve built. While we aren’t able to provide further details on their future plans for the app, we hope you can understand, and will look forward to it.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe acquisition means the app is going away. Today, we removed Weather Line from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. For all existing Weather Line users, free and paid, the app will continue working for 13 months, until April 1, 2022.</blockquote>The developers went on to emphasize that no personal user data, such as email addresses and payment information, was included in the acquisition deal, and there are no circumstances in which anyone will be billed again by the app.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWeather Line's smart infographic-focused design, streamlined forecast interface, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">widgets</a> proved a hit with iOS users, so it will be interesting to see what comes of it in future. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDark Sky, another popular third-party weather app, was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/31/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky/\">acquired</a> by Apple last year, but there's currently no suggestion that Apple is behind the Weather Line buyout. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/weather-line-ios-app-acquired/\">Popular Weather Line App Acquired By Unnamed Buyer, Service to Shut Down Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-weather-line-app-acquired-by-unnamed-buyer-service-to-shut-down-next-year.2286755/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Gr825qNvBwY:TAnjXqVCln8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Gr825qNvBwY:TAnjXqVCln8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Gr825qNvBwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2fd7c39c7c111d5314879ecd720ab04dcc93241f17c20b9a1464b4ef9e6031d","category":"Apple"}
