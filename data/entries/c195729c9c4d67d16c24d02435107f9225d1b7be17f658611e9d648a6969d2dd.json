This includes everything from home electronics to clothing, jewelry, video games, movies, and much more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with these vendors.

Right now, that includes savings on AirPods, AirPods Max, iPads, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and other devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMany retailers are challenging Amazon with summertime sale events of their own, so when prices are matching -- or beating -- Amazon Prime Day, we'll mark them below. Readers should also note that sometimes Prime Day sales are time sensitive, so purchase quickly if you're interested.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAmazon Prime Day sales require an Amazon Prime membership. Additionally, deals change fast during Prime Day, so the prices you see below may eventually change on Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods Pro</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe popular AirPods Pro are down to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$189.99</strong></a> during Prime Day, from an original price of $249.00. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/AirPods-Pro-Discount-Feature-Yellow.jpg\" /><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$59 OFF</div>$189.99 For Prime Day</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>AirPods</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll also find discounts on the regular AirPods models.
