I have tried with 2 different displays with 2 different HDMI cables with the same thing occurring on each one. I am currently only using one at a time. I also noticed some pink squares/graphics glitches on the Big Sur boot/log in screen (with the coloured background, not the black and white boot up)</blockquote><em>MacRumors</em> reader Mike, who emailed us about the issue, has seen the same problems.<blockquote>I have a new Mac Mini &zwnj;M1&zwnj; with 16 GB of RAM running Big Sur 11.2.3 and every time the computer and screen go to sleep, the computer will not be able to wake the screen up.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nActually, I get \"No Signal\" displayed on the screen after the Mini wakes so technically the computer wakes the monitor but it fails to send a video signal. The screen is a 34\" LG Ultrawide 4K Thunderbolt. It wakes fine with my 2018 MacBook Pro so there's nothing wrong with the display itself.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe only way I can get the Mini to send a signal to the display is to unplug and replug in the Thunderbolt cable. Sometimes repeatedly. Obviously, this is not an ideal solution.</blockquote>This issue appears to be affecting a wide range of displays that connect over Thunderbolt, HDMI, and DisplayPort adapters, but there are also plenty of people who are having no issues at all.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's not clear what the problem is, but Apple has been looking into one &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; display issue that causes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/21/pink-squares-external-display-m1-mac-mini/\">strange pink squares</a> to appear on displays connected to one of the machines.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is aware of the issue, and there could be a fix in the works that's coming in a future update. One solution for now may be to disable the feature that puts the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; to sleep, but that's not ideal. The other solution is to unplug and replug in a display that's not responding after a &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; wakes from sleep, but that too is an inelegant solution. There appears to be no other fix available at this time.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/25/m1-mac-mini-connected-display-issue/\">M1 Mac Mini Won&#039;t Wake Connected Displays, Some Owners Complain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-mac-mini-wont-wake-connected-displays-some-owners-complain.2289623/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YRNb-2KL9Z4:nNgMh1x__tI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YRNb-2KL9Z4:nNgMh1x__tI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YRNb-2KL9Z4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d2e343773152656619d401bfbf6d88e9e6e45a0141a137a211e95c3940554b89","category":"Apple"}
