The name Cox isn’t uncommon, so he figured there must be another David Cox doing AI research. “Then I opened up the PDF and saw my own picture looking back at me,” <a href=\"https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/david-cox/\">Cox</a> says. “It was unbelievable.”</p>\n<p>It isn’t clear how prevalent this kind of academic fraud may be or why someone would list as a co-author someone not involved in the research. By checking other papers written by the same Chinese authors, WIRED found a third example, where the photo and biography of an MIT researcher were listed under a fictitious name.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743891#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743891&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"288a0c25be70ad5a22281709a3c4aa3efd87c69f375413d38d87ac130587cd0a","category":"Tech"}
