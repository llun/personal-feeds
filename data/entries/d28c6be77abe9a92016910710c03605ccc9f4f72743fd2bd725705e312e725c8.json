In a follow-up tweet, he seems to have ruled out new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models being unveiled at this time, suggesting that it is still too early for an announcement.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/wwdc-2021-details.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nLeading up to WWDC, which kicks off today with Apple's Keynote at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, there had been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/wwdc-new-macbook-pro-models/\">some rumors</a> that at least one new MacBook Pro model with Apple silicon would be announced at the developer conference.
