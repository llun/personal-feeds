This time around, the \"setting has been expanded to include the skies above Hyrule,\" a move highlighted by Link falling through the clouds to an island below at the trailer's introduction (a scene that brings <em>Skyward Sword</em> to mind).</p>\n<p>The brief trailer teases a few new and upgraded abilities, including Link phasing through solid rock to rise up through the bottom of a floating island and freezing a giant spiked cement ball to roll it back at the enemies who sent it. The trailer concludes with scenes of a castle being violently ripped from the ground and suspended mid-air in a field of wispy red miasma.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773583\">Read on Ars Technica</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773583&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2b8b338dbafe5cc4749866b11589e0c8bd873642838aab6690de78bd52800910","category":"Tech"}
