The Volta a Catalunya, a WorldTour stage race that features plenty of climbing, should provide ample opportunity for Sagan to continue improving his form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before he heads to the Volta a Catalunya, however, Sagan will take on Milan-San Remo this weekend. He has often started among the pre-race favorites for the Italian Monument, but he has never won the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I started the Tirreno with little preparation. Milan-Sanremo will be a lottery for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That can turn out well or badly. And then another week of hard racing awaits me in the Volta a Catalunya. I&#8217;ll give it a try and we&#8217;ll see what it turns out to be. Another week of hard racing seems to us to be the best way to prepare for the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/after-covid-setback-peter-sagan-will-seek-flanders-and-roubaix-form-at-catalunya/\">After COVID setback, Sagan will seek classics form at Catalunya</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4c2dcbd146abe7d7a1611f21267c02e1c8f854f3f60bca6f15ba074c5e166bb0","category":"Cycling"}
