No ‌AirPower‌ materialized in 2018 and after months of rumors of development issues, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/\">canceled the project</a> in March 2019.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌AirPower‌ failed because Apple engineers were unable to solve multiple bugs affecting the device, including interference problems and issues with overheating. In 2020 alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, Apple instead unveiled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>, a magnetic wireless charging alternative.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince the ‌AirPower‌ was canceled, there have been persistent rumors that Apple is still working on some kind of charging mat, but most have been nebulous. Gurman's report is the clearest hint we've had yet that some kind of AirPower-like device could still come out in the future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to a wireless charger that's similar to the ‌AirPower‌, Apple is also said to be \"internally investigating\" alternative wireless charging methods that can work over greater distances. Work on long range charging is in the early stages, though, and it's likely to be several years before we see any kind of new long-range wireless charging technology from Apple.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">bloomberg.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/apple-developing-airpower-like-charger/\">Apple Still Developing AirPower-Like Charger, Also Exploring Long-Range Wireless Charging</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-developing-airpower-like-charger-also-exploring-long-range-wireless-charging.2299149/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ks8Gh4eJyDc:khhhxwamoJU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ks8Gh4eJyDc:khhhxwamoJU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ks8Gh4eJyDc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba85b79181e0aa5ed6e1df79ee8bc6e104a069e74d0e100d7a967ad7f60f51c9","category":"Apple"}
