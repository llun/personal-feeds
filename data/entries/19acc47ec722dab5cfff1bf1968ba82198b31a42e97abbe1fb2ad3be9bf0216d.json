Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> long thought lost has resurfaced. The 1991 Soviet television adaptation has been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vquKyNdgH3s\">uploaded</a> to YouTube in two one-hour videos.</p>\n<p>The film focuses on the events of the first book in the trilogy, <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, and features many elements that were excluded from the popular global theatrical release by director Peter Jackson, including an extended sequence featuring the character Tom Bombadil—one of the biggest omissions by the bigger-budget 2001 film far more of us have seen.</p>\n<p>Originally broadcast on TV in 1991 (and then never aired again), the film was thought lost to time by those who had seen it. But as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/05/soviet-tv-version-lord-of-the-rings-rediscovered-after-30-years\">reported</a> in The Guardian, Leningrad Television successor Channel 5 uploaded the film to its YouTube page with little fanfare, surprising fans who had given up on seeing the production again. It is believed to be the only adaptation of these books produced in the Soviet Union.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754541#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754541&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19acc47ec722dab5cfff1bf1968ba82198b31a42e97abbe1fb2ad3be9bf0216d","category":"Tech"}
