This is the first significant deal we've seen for the PlayStation 5 gamepad, which has retailed for $70 at major retailers since the PS5's launch last year.</p>\n<p>Our PS5 review gave a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/\">favorable impression of the DualSense</a>: it's a bit bigger than the old DualShock 4 but still comfortable to hold, and it has an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/hands-on-with-the-ps5s-synesthetic-dualsense-controller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">impressively detailed haptic rumble system</a>, a built-in microphone for voice chat (with a built-in mute function), USB-C charging, and the same general layout that PlayStation owners have become accustomed to over the past couple of decades.</p>\n<p>There <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/16/tech/sony-ps5-controller-drift-lawsuit/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>have</em> been reports</a> of controllers suffering <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/ps5-controllers-are-drifting-and-the-repairs-are-a-has-1846233739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">from drifting joysticks</a> and <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/ps5-dualsense-adaptive-trigger-broken/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">busted triggers</a> in the months since the PS5's launch, which is worrying, though Sony at least appears to cover those issues under warranty (albeit with an added shipping cost). Either way, with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/ps4-gamepads-wont-work-for-ps5-games-sony-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PS4 controllers only supported on PS4 games</a> and the market for third-party PS5 controllers almost entirely barren, the DualSense is more or less the only option PS5 owners have. If you need a spare today—and are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/sony-playstation-5-where-to-pre-order/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actually able to purchase</a> a PS5 in the first place—this deal should lessen the blow to some extent.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748776#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1748776&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"23848765f66144754dffd5c1c1497fcf92b6d15d1b2334b21ee0c059148d6740","category":"Tech"}
