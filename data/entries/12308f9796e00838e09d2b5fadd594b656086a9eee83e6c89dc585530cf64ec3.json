That target happens to be an entirely different video game: <em>No Man's Sky</em>!                      [credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://hellogames.org/\">Hello Games</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>We at Ars Technica love crossover events in every pop-culture format, but they're arguably the best in video games, since they let fans settle playground arguments regarding which superhero or mascot could win in a fight. Still, that affection doesn't mean Ars must keep up with every single \"dream\" announcement about third-party characters in games like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/smash-bros-ultimate-review-the-best-fighting-game-on-any-nintendo-system/\"><em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, <em>Soulcalibur VI</em>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/tekken-7-review-get-ready-for-the-next-good-pc-fighting-game/\"><em>Tekken 7</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/mortal-kombat-11-review-great-gameplay-excessively-packaged/\"><em>Mortal Kombat 11</em></a>, <em>Samurai Shodown</em>, <em>Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid</em>, and so on. We love them! Bring them on! But most IP crossovers don't warrant a headline. (Sorry, <a href=\"https://www.mortalkombat.com/roster/rambo\">John</a> \"two games in one year\" <a href=\"https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/05/rambo-john-mcclane-limited-time-bundle-bio-bocw-warzone\">Rambo</a>.)</p>\n<p>In today's case, I've made an exception.</p>\n<p>The latest update to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/no-mans-sky/\"><em>No Man's Sky</em></a>, which goes live sometime today, unlocks a very familiar spaceship inside <em>NMS</em>'s nearly infinite universe: the SSV <em>Normandy</em> SR-1, lifted from the first <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/mass-effect/\"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> game. Yes, that's the SR-1, not the eventual SR-2. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX6JgWh7OXk\">Tali would approve</a>.) While <em>Normandy</em> doesn't come with a handy Mako for players to drop onto Hello Games' <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/08/no-mans-sky-review-total-eclipse-of-the-galaxys-heart/\">18 quintillion planets</a>, it <em>does</em> include an incredible S rating (seen in the above gallery). As far as <em>No Man's Sky</em> frigates go, the SR-1 is SR-number-one.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766418#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766418&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"12308f9796e00838e09d2b5fadd594b656086a9eee83e6c89dc585530cf64ec3","category":"Tech"}
