For the past 13 years, Microsoft has required third-party drivers and other code that runs in the Windows kernel to be tested and digitally signed by the OS maker to ensure stability and security. Without a Microsoft certificate, these types of programs can’t be installed by default.</p>\n<h2>Eavesdropping on SSL connections</h2>\n<p>Earlier this month, Karsten Hahn, a researcher at security firm G Data, found that his company’s malware detection system <a href=\"https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/microsoft-signed-a-malicious-netfilter-rootkit\">flagged a driver named Netfilter</a>.
