Jakobsen offered his own take on the situation on Thursday on Twitter. He also noted that his lawyers were handling proceedings against Groenewegen now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would like to set the record straight, though: Dylan has not offered a personal apology and he has not shown willingness to take any responsibility for his actions,” Jakobsen wrote amid a series of tweets. “I still would like to reach an understanding with Dylan, but it takes two to tango.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>EF Education-Nippo unveils Giro kit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second straight year, the <strong>EF Education-Nippo</strong> organization will take on the <strong>Giro d’Italia</strong> in an <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/no-pink-and-no-ducks-efs-new-giro-swap-out-kit/\">alternate kit</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American WorldTour team, whose kit collaboration with Palace generated plenty of conversation last year, unveiled its new look for this year’s race on Thursday.
