On the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> with 5G, Apple has a \"Smart Data Mode,\" which automatically switches between a 5G and 4G/LTE connection depending on the user's current needs, connection strength, and battery life.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to code within the beta, Apple may take a similar approach with HiFi support on ‌Apple Music‌, only offering users high-fidelity audio streaming when there's sufficient bandwidth or depending on other factors such as a user's data consumption.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/spotify-hifi-lossless-streaming-option/\">Spotify has announced plans to include HiFi support</a> for subscribers sometime this year but has yet to announce a specific date. Apple is reportedly preparing to announce the new HiFi tier as soon as a few weeks alongside the release of new third-generation ‌AirPods‌. The new tier will reportedly cost the same as the current individual ‌Apple Music‌ tier. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the evidence that HiFi ‌Apple Music‌ support could be limited to only newer ‌AirPods‌ models, Apple may offer HiFi as a separate, more expensive tier for owners of compatible ‌AirPods‌. Thus, customers with older ‌AirPods‌ would be able to retain their existing ‌Apple Music‌ subscription without HiFi support.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt WWDC last year, Apple did announce automatic switching for ‌AirPods‌ and Spatial Audio for ‌AirPods Pro‌ and newer AirPod products. With <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2021</a> being just weeks away, Apple could announce the new ‌Apple Music‌ tier at the event, marketing them as an add-on feature for the third-generation ‌AirPods‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> previously reported that the new ‌AirPods‌ would enter <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">mass production in the third quarter of the year</a>. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/01/ios-14-6-beta-6-hifi-apple-music/\">iOS 14.6 Beta 1 Code Hints at Upcoming HiFi Apple Music Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-14-6-beta-1-code-hints-at-upcoming-hifi-apple-music-support.2294343/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PHxfJiRzlxc:1VUXdv2SObo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=PHxfJiRzlxc:1VUXdv2SObo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/PHxfJiRzlxc\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c410ed38a62b7c37f40445278db682f2b44e71c9fb0f34a60b4d058d674b68ba","category":"Apple"}
