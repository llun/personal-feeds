But tracking can go on in your email inbox, too.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/04/mail-ios-app-icon.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nUnsolicited marketing emails will sometimes know whether you've opened their email, and if so, when you did so. They can even know where you were at the time, thanks to tracking methods employed by marketing platforms like MailChimp.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe way they track is very discreet and kind of creepy. Embedded in the email will be a tracking pixel, often hidden within a signature image or a link. When the message is opened in your email client, code within the pixel silently sends this information back to the company.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome email account providers attempt to limit this sort of tracking by routing images through proxy servers, for example, which hides your location. But there's actually a simple way of preventing tracking pixels altogether, and that's by disabling the automatic loading of images in your email client. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe following steps show you how to disable automatic image loading in Apple Mail for macOS, and below them, you'll find instructions to do the same in iOS.\r\n<br />\r\n<ol><li>Launch <strong>Apple Mail</strong>.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Select <strong>Mail -&gt; Preferences</strong> from the menu bar.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/apple-mail-prevent-tracking1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n</li><li>Click the <strong>Viewing</strong> tab.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Uncheck the box next to <strong>Load remote content in messages</strong>.\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/apple-mail-prevent-tracking2.jpg\" /></li></ol>If you're using Mail for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, you can find the same setting in the <strong>Settings</strong> app. Tap <strong>Mail</strong>, look under \"Messages,\" and turn off the toggle next to <strong>Load Remote Images</strong>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mail/\">Mail</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/stop-emails-tracking-you-apple-mail/\">How to Prevent Emails From Tracking You in Apple Mail</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-prevent-emails-from-tracking-you-in-apple-mail.2296033/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Jtyia-wmLdc:6Z7jpRYFXzo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Jtyia-wmLdc:6Z7jpRYFXzo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Jtyia-wmLdc\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"25838e1ab95ccbdf7273e4518759eb5c915d9b36b121d0b376394f7e9f30301e","category":"Apple"}
