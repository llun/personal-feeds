Even though 2/3 of the data in the new normals is present in the previous ones, the last decade's still been hot enough to drag the temperatures upwards.

They also reveal that while much of the US is getting wetter with the changing climate, California and the Southwest are in the midst of a dramatic drying trend.</p>\n<h2>What’s normal, anyway?</h2>\n<p>As NOAA puts it, you're most likely to come across its climate normals on a weather forecast when the projected conditions are compared to the ones typical for that location and time of year. The normals provide information on what's typical.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762457#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1762457&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c52471b51accdbe80bc7d664193d75f37ecf85e41b5eac41028433dbf88d9f0f","category":"Tech"}
