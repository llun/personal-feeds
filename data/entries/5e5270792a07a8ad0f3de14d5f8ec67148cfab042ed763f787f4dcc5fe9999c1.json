The new spec allows for considerably heftier charging rates between compliant USB-PD devices.</p>\n<h2>Relatively minimal changes</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/arcy-sparky.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/arcy-sparky-640x194.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/arcy-sparky.jpg\">Bumping allowed voltage up from 20 V to 48 V means greater potential for damage due to arcing as cables are unplugged.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-21\">USB 3.0 Promoter Group</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Although Leung points out that the new specification has been under development for two years, very little has changed. Comparing the USB-C 2.0 standard to today's 2.1 standard, the optional new Extended Power Range (EPR) specification—which bumps maximum voltage up to 48 V, sufficient to deliver 240 W at 5 A—seems to be by far the largest change.</p>\n<p>From a consumer's perspective, the physical standard hasn't changed—USB-C type 2.1 devices will plug into USB-C type 2.0 ports, and vice versa. Under the hood, the standards on the midplate have gotten stricter—a new paragraph has been added mandating that pins A4-A9 and B4-B9 (power, power delivery, and legacy USB 2.0 support) must not short to ground during connector mating.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767661#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1767661&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e5270792a07a8ad0f3de14d5f8ec67148cfab042ed763f787f4dcc5fe9999c1","category":"Tech"}
