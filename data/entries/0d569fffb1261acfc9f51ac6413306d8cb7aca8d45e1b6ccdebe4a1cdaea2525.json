The ‌iPhone 12 Pro Max‌ zooms in at its max 12x ability, while the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra gets a closer shot thanks to its 100x digital zoom feature. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TZQSRQ53Sx8\">second ad</a>, Samsung targets the ‌iPhone 12 Pro Max‌ 12MP wide camera, compared to the Galaxy S21 Ultra 108MP main camera. The video features both flagship devices zooming into a burger, concluding that the photo taken with the Galaxy Ultra 21 allows users to see \"pin-sharp details,\" while the photo taken with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> does not.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSamsung starts both ads by saying, \"Your smartphone upgrade shouldn't be a downgrade,\" insinuating that an upgrade to an ‌iPhone‌ is a downgrade rather than an upgrade. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra features a wide array of camera features, including a 108MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, and a telephoto lens. The 100x zoom featured in the Galaxy S21 Ultra is, however, only digital. Compared to optical zoom, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 12 Pro Max‌ features up to 2.5x zoom-in, while the Galaxy offers up to 3x. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/galaxy-s21-ultra-ad-versus-iphone-12-pro-max/\">Samsung Pokes Fun at iPhone 12 Pro Max's Lack of 100x Digital Zoom in New Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CtAft4LAS_8:LAlrZAQuYwQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CtAft4LAS_8:LAlrZAQuYwQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CtAft4LAS_8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d569fffb1261acfc9f51ac6413306d8cb7aca8d45e1b6ccdebe4a1cdaea2525","category":"Apple"}
