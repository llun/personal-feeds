Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar went head-to-head last year, with Pogacar coming out on top to win the yellow jersey at the first attempt. Ahead of the 2021 edition, their rematch is taking the headlines, and deservedly so.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, there will be 182 other riders that depart from Brest, and although few others have a genuine chance of riding through </span><span>Champs-Élysées in the yellow jersey,</span><span> many could have a substantial impact on the Tour and could be going under the radar.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\">Tour de France 2021 Guide</a></strong></em></p>\n<h4><em><strong></strong></em></h4>\n<h4><b>Mark Padun</b></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1322129773_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623328364\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Mark Padun wins at the Criterium du Dauphine (Image credit: Bas Czerwinski/Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p><span>Mark Padun enjoyed a quiet start to the 2021 season. He had no outstanding results to speak of at Tirreno-Adriatico, the Itzulia Basque Country Tour or the Tour of the Alps. The 24-year-old from Ukraine was unlucky not to win a stage at the Giro d’Italia last year when he suffered a mechanical, which resigned him to finishing second behind Jhonatan Narváez in Cesenatico.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, Padun burst into life at the Criterium du Dauphine this season. He dropped time early in the race which allowed him the freedom to attack in the final stages. Then, Padun won the first of the two big mountain stages in sublime fashion, where he attacked away from the favourites early on La Plagne. It was the first WorldTour victory of Padun’s career. He wasn’t done there, though, and won in emphatic fashion the next day with over 90 seconds to guess who, Jonas Vingegaard in second.</span></p>\n<p><span>Padun has been inconsistent in his career so far and we can’t expect him to be more than a domestique at the Tour de France for Bahrain-Victorious who hope to start with Pello Bilbao, Jack Haig and Wout Poels. However, given Padun’s stage hunting prowess, he could walk away from the Tour de France as a Grand Tour stage winner. Watch out for him in the breakaway on mountain stages.</span></p>\n<b></b>\n<h4><b>Alex Aranburu</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1321925108_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623328346\" /></span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>Image credit: Bas Czerwinski/Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Alex Aranburu has three Grand Tour starts to his name, but all three have been at his home Vuelta Espana. The Spaniard first displayed his attributes at WorldTour level with Caja Rural at the 2019 Vuelta, when he was second on two occasions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Aranburu joined Astana in 2020 and after numerous near misses, he broke his duck at the Itzulia Basque Country Tour in 2021. Aranburu attacked late on stage 2 and was never seen again before crossing the finish line in Sestao.</span></p>\n<p><span>Aranburu is a very well-rounded rider, who can sprint capably and get over climbs both long and short. He already has two top-tens to his name at Milan San Remo and was in the top 10 on four of the eight stages at the recent Criterium du Dauphine. Despite that, Aranburu wasn’t able to win a stage in France, and that seems to be Aranburu’s only issue right now. His all-terrain ability usually puts him in a great position and means he could be a serial winner in his career. However, he has often struggled to convert opportunities into victories — he has 18 top tens with Astana already, but just one victory.</span></p>\n<p><span>Aranburu will almost certainly get chances either</span><span> from the breakaway or on punchy finishes which lie somewhere between the pure sprinters and punchers. Can he increase his strike rate?</span></p>\n\n<h4><strong>Jonas Vingegaard</strong></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1304049314_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623328288\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Jonas Vingegaard wins atop Jebel Jais at the UAE Tour (</em><em>Image credit: Tim de Waele/Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p><span>A late call-up to Jumbo-Visma’s TDF lineup. Jonas Vingegaard joined the Dutch outfit in 2019, and his standout result was a stage win at the Tour of Poland until this season. Vingegaard has elevated his game to a whole new level in 2021. He won on Jebel Jais at the UAE Tour, before winning two stages and the overall classification at Coppi e Bartali in March. The Italian five-day stage race isn’t WorldTour level, but Vingegaard defeated a plethora of talented riders including Mikkel Honore, Ethan Hayer and Mauri Vansevenant.</span></p>\n<p><span>Vingegaard’s impressive run only continued at the Itzulia Basque Country Tour. He was third in the opening time trial and although he didn’t win a stage, he claimed second overall behind his leader Primoz Roglic. As Roglic attacked up the road on the final stage to Arrate, Vingegaard sat behind and marked Pogacar’s every move. This is no mean feat by any stretch, but Vingegaard made it look easy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Still just 24 years of age, Vingegaard has demonstrated that he could be a GC challenger for years to come at Grand Tours — he is adept on uphill terrain and is a very good time trialist. However, entering his first Tour de France and only his second Grand Tour, it will be too soon for him to have his own ambitions in the GC. Instead, he’ll act as one of Primoz Roglic’s top domestiques.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Mikkel Bjerg</b></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1320802740_1024x1024.jpg?v=1623328321\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Mikkel Bjerg heads the pack at the Criterium du Dauphine (<span>Image credit: Bas Czerwinski/Getty Images)</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Mikkel Bjerg is just 22 years old and has only been a WorldTour rider since the beginning of the 2020 season. However, the Dane has consistently proven that he is a threat on a variety of terrains.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bjerg joined UAE Team Emirates as a time-trialist, and it remains his strongest discipline. He was third on the opening time-trial at the UAE Tour where he was only beaten by Filippo Ganna and Stefan Bissegger. However, Bjerg had a solid cobble classics campaign in Belgium, and he was a noteworthy third on stage 9 of the Giro d’Italia last year. He was only beaten by Ruben Guerreiro and Jonathan Castroviejo on a stage which featured over 4,500 metres of climbing and finished on the Roccaraso.</span></p>\n<p><span>This all means that he will be a crucial domestique for Tadej Pogacar yellow jersey defence, particularly on the flatter terrain in a team which boasts an array of strong climbers such as Rafal Majka and David de la Cruz. Further, look out for Bjerg in the stage 5 and stage 20 time-trials where he could spring a surprise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: Bas Czerwinski/Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"d7a42f5a7b7933a4d5612d4f3e82533e047036fbf275a0b790f0737c11691b76","category":"Cycling"}
