You'll also find more information about data collected in web views and data that may be entered by users within documents or other file types.</blockquote>On its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/\">developer website</a>, Apple has a detailed list of the kind of information that developers must provide for their apps, and explanations of the types of data collection that must be disclosed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nData collection for tracking purposes, third-party advertising, marketing, and other reasons must be disclosed to users, and developers are required to self-report using Apple's guidelines. As of December, Apple has been requiring &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; developers to provide App Privacy label information to submit new apps and app updates to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple does not check the data that each app submits, and in January, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/29/app-store-privacy-labels-accuracy-report/\">more than a dozen apps</a> providing inaccurate or misleading data in their privacy labels.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple said in response that it is subjecting developers to routine and ongoing audits of information provided. The company works with developers to correct inaccuracies and has said that apps that fail to disclose accurate privacy information may have future updates rejected or could be removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; entirely.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/\">privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/app-privacy-labels-developer-info/\">Apple Offers Developers Clarification on Some App Privacy Data Reporting Requirements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-developers-clarification-on-some-app-privacy-data-reporting-requirements.2285945/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zy2q1dQPgdI:5S8OTFbYo2U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=zy2q1dQPgdI:5S8OTFbYo2U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/zy2q1dQPgdI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"051d43e488b21111571cc7174cd264ecf54359a5c7ea6b843122fe4f8cdeb761","category":"Apple"}
