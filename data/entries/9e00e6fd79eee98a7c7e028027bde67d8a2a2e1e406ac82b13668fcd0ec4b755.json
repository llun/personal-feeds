The notch on each iPhone is visibly smaller as a result of the earpiece speaker being moved up into the top bezel, a design choice that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/20/leaked-iphone-12-schematics-smaller-notch/\">first rumored for iPhone 12 models</a> last year but failed to materialize.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and a few other sources previously claimed that a few Face ID components will be consolidated in iPhone 13 models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">resulting in a smaller notch</a>, but they did not mention the earpiece being repositioned.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe notch's design has gone unchanged since it debuted on the iPhone X in 2017. After shrinking the notch this year, Kuo said that Apple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">switch to a hole-punch display design for at least some 2022 iPhone models</a>, similar to Samsung's Galaxy S21 and other recent smartphones, followed by an iPhone with a true all-screen design without a notch or holes and an under-display fingerprint scanner as early as 2023. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBeyond the notch, iPhone 13 models are expected to have a virtually identical design as iPhone 12 models, with key new features rumored to include a 120Hz display on Pro models, larger batteries, a faster A15 chip, and camera improvements. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 13 lineup in September, marking a return to its usual launch timeframe.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/23/alleged-iphone-13-front-glass-photo/\">iPhone 13 Front Glass Reveals Smaller Notch With Earpiece Relocated to Top Bezel</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-front-glass-reveals-smaller-notch-with-earpiece-relocated-to-top-bezel.2289346/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=W2XbbJ-4uWU:b1nbJpE-f_Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=W2XbbJ-4uWU:b1nbJpE-f_Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/W2XbbJ-4uWU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e00e6fd79eee98a7c7e028027bde67d8a2a2e1e406ac82b13668fcd0ec4b755","category":"Apple"}
