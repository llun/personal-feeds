The news comes from a <a href=\"https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/5111363002?gh_jid=5111363002\">job posting</a> for an automation and controls engineer position flagged in a <a href=\"https://www.kxan.com/news/local/elon-musks-spacex-is-building-a-manufacturing-facility-in-austin/\">story Tuesday</a> by local news channel KXAN.</p>\n<p>\"To keep up with global demand, SpaceX is breaking ground on a new, state of the art manufacturing facility in Austin, TX,\" the job posting said. \"The Automation &amp; Controls Engineer will play a key role as we strive to manufacture millions of consumer facing devices that we ship directly to customers (Starlink dishes, Wi-Fi routers, mounting hardware, etc).\"</p>\n<p>The factory apparently won't make the dishes and routers on site but will instead design systems that improve the manufacturing process. \"Specifically, they will design and develop control systems and software for production line machineryâ€”ultimately tackling the toughest mechanical, software, and electrical challenges that come with high-volume manufacturing, all while maintaining a focus on flexibility, reliability, maintainability, and ease of use,\" the job posting said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747067#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1747067&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d3575512cb5ed743d9005ae9379799d35f4f75ae2641634574e9f1ed66779671","category":"Tech"}
