Apple has also released iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 betas for public beta testers, with the software able to be updated with the proper profile from Apple's public beta testing website. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\niOS 14.5 is the biggest update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> to date, introducing several significant new features. First and foremost, Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/iphone-apple-watch-unlocking-ios-14-5/\">making it easier to unlock an iPhone</a> when you're wearing a face mask with a new \"Unlock with Apple Watch\" feature.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdVmNcq6jD0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nThis opt-in option lets you use an unlocked and authenticated Apple Watch as a secondary authentication method to unlock an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; alongside Face ID. With this feature, you no longer have to enter a passcode or remove your mask to unlock your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Both an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running iOS 14.5 and an Apple Watch are required to use this, and the Apple Watch cannot authenticate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> purchases, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases, or unlock third-party apps that use Face ID.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/iphone-apple-watch-unlock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1140\" height=\"847\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781387\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe update also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-enables-5g-in-dual-sim-mode/\">brings worldwide support</a> for 5G in Dual-SIM mode on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models, so if you use multiple lines, both can now connect at 5G speeds.
