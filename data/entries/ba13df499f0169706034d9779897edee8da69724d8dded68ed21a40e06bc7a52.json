The latest versions of our software now\nrun natively on the new Apple Silicon-powered machines, to provide\nthe best possible performance on this impressive new hardware. If\nyou’ve already got an M chip-based Mac, just download the latest\nversions of our products and you should be all set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not an easy transition for Rogue Amoeba, either:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As we noted in previous posts, a bit more setup is required to\ninstall our audio handling extension “ACE”, used by Airfoil, Audio\nHijack, Loopback, Piezo, and SoundSource. Those apps will guide\nyou through the necessary steps to get up and running, but if you\nneed more assistance, we have a <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=ACE-BigSur#mchipinstructions\">comprehensive step-by-step\nguide</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, this process is quick, and it only needs to be done\nonce. After you’ve authorized ACE on your Mac, future updates will\nbe lightning-fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I use a few Rogue Amoeba utilities (a Mac feels broken to me without <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/\">SoundSource</a>, for example), and their beta versions during the Big Sur/Apple Silicon transition were more reliable than most apps’ stable releases. This was a difficult transition for something like their ACE extension, but as a user, Rogue Amoeba made it look like it was no sweat.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘All Rogue Amoeba Apps Now Have Official Support for the New M1 Macs and Big Sur’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/03/rogue-amoeba-m1-support\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ba13df499f0169706034d9779897edee8da69724d8dded68ed21a40e06bc7a52","category":"Tech"}
