It will provide a more visual output of the stats that Strava currently emails out monthly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As with many of its enhanced features, including the changes to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-personal-heatmap/\">personal heatmaps</a> made in January, the Monthly Stats feature will only be fully available to Strava users paying a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-leaderboards-routes-subscription/\">monthly subscription</a>, although free users will get a limited preview of their stats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new Monthly Stats feature is one of a stream of updates that Strava is making to the app, as it looks to revamp the experience and make more features available to its paying subscribers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maybe seeing that you cycled 500km less last month than the previous one will motivate you to get out a bit more. Or maybe you’ll just sink further into your sofa and trawl Netflix for yet another series you’ve missed. It’s your choice.</span></p></body>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"af9e9f756e4db7f79bbbbf9d764c8fedc2bdd9b94adc1415ed81afa59bea2e13","category":"Cycling"}
