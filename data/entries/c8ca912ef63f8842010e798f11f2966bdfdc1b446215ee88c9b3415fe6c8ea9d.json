Today, we learned the price points of each TV in the lineup, from the new, lower-end A series to the ultrapremium G series.</p>\n<p>This year, LG's OLED TVs will range between $1,300 and $6,000, depending on the specific product line and screen size.</p>\n<p>At the bottom end is the LG A1, which omits costly, mostly gaming-specific features—like 120Hz panels, variable refresh rate (VRR), and the HDMI 2.1 connection that makes those possible—to get OLEDs more accessible (and more competitive with the cheaper-to-produce LCD TV alternatives) than before. Available in 48-, 55-, 65-, and 77-inch sizes, the A1 will ship with a suggested retail price of $1,300, $1,600, $2,200, or $3,200, respectively.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752247#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752247&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c8ca912ef63f8842010e798f11f2966bdfdc1b446215ee88c9b3415fe6c8ea9d","category":"Tech"}
