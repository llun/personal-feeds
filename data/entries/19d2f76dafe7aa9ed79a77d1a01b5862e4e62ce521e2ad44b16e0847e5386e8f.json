Also, the company announced that a much-anticipated Showtime show will end up on Paramount+ instead.</p>\n<p>Paramount+, which was announced several months ago, will launch on March 4 in the United States, Canada, and 18 Latin American countries. As with CBS All Access, both an ad-supported and ad-free plan will be offered. In the US, the ad-supported one will cost $4.99 per month, while the ad-free plan will cost $9.99.</p>\n<p>That $4.99 per month is $1 cheaper than the ad-supported version of CBS All Access. However, this cheaper plan will not include local CBS stations. The service is also expected to launch in Nordic countries within a few weeks and in Australia sometime later this year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745261#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1745261&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19d2f76dafe7aa9ed79a77d1a01b5862e4e62ce521e2ad44b16e0847e5386e8f","category":"Tech"}
