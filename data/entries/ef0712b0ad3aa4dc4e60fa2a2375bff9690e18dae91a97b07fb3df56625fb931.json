After all, who really wants to spend more time in front of their screen? That’s exactly why we’ve <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/\">designed the online workshop experience from scratch</a>, accounting for the time needed to take in all the content, understand it and have enough time to ask <em>just</em> the right questions.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\"><img src=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/394a4d0e-4c57-4d55-a72a-87f244ab1320/kececypa-1.png\" /></a>\nIn <a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">our workshops</a>, everybody is just a slightly blurry rectangle on the screen; everybody is equal, and invited to participate.\n\n\n<p>Our online workshops take place <strong>live</strong> and span <strong>multiple days across weeks.</strong> They are split into 2.5h-sessions, and in every session there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don’t rush through the content, but instead try to create a welcoming, friendly and inclusive environment for everyone to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/\">things to expect from a Smashing workshop</a>, but the most important one is focus on <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques. The workshops aren’t talks; they are <strong>interactive</strong>, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work.</p>\n<p>Of course, you get all workshop materials and <strong>video recordings</strong> as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.</p>\n<h4>TL;DR</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshops span <strong>multiple days</strong>, split in <em>2.5h-sessions</em>.</li>\n<li>Enough time for live Q&amp;A every day.</li>\n<li>Dozens of <strong>practical examples</strong> and techniques.</li>\n<li>You’ll get all workshop materials &amp; recordings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/workshops\">All workshops</a> are focused on front-end &amp; UX.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/bundles\">Get a workshop bundle</a> and <strong>save $250</strong> off the price.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Jump to all workshops →</a></div>\n\n<h3>Thank You!</h3>\n<p>We hope that the <strong>insights from the workshops</strong> will help you improve your skills and the quality of your work.
