It’s magnetic, and it works with MagSafe iPhones, but the charger itself doesn’t support MagSafe. It’s just a lousy 5W Qi charger that has a circle of magnets to help it stay in place — charging is going to be <em>very</em> slow compared to actual MagSafe, and even slower compared to using a Lightning cable charger. When I use a portable charger to top off my phone, I want it to work fast. It also seems very inefficient — why would a 5,000 mAh charger only be able to charge an iPhone 12 Mini <em>once</em>? (I also don’t know why MacRumors is promoting this as “MagSafe”. Yes, in the review, they do mention that it’s <em>not</em> MagSafe, but the headline says “MagSafe” and the promotional graphic for the review just say “$40 MagSafe”.)</p>\n\n<p>Let’s hope Apple is nearing completion on the portable MagSafe charger <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-19/apple-is-working-on-magnetic-battery-pack-attachment-for-iphones\">that Gurman said they were working on</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/16/anker-portable-magnetic-charging-pack\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"743cef1ba34d1dc816c0b7a5e9911e57607f938180bf23140bdd71f366d52599","category":"Tech"}
