However, the automaker walked back the statement just hours later, and merely said that it had \"received requests for potential cooperation from various companies regarding development of autonomous EVs.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>Bloomberg</em> on Friday reported that talks between Apple and Hyundai had \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-pauses-car-talks-hyundai-kia/\">paused recently</a>,\" adding that Hyundai's original statement and the subsequent reports \"upset Apple,\" a company known for its culture of secrecy.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLast week, Korean newspaper <em>Dong-A Ilbo</em> reported that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/03/apple-car-kia-investment/\">planning to invest the equivalent of &#36;3.6 billion in Kia</a> as part of a planned manufacturing partnership between the two companies that would have seen Kia build the Apple Car at its assembly plant in Georgia. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the Apple Car would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/kuo-apple-car-use-hyundai-e-gmp-platform/\">based on Hyundai's E-GMP electric vehicle platform</a>, which would have allowed for a range of over 300 miles, acceleration from 0-60 miles per hour in as little as 3.5 seconds, a top speed of 160 miles per hour, up to an 80% charge within 18 minutes, and more.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>Nikkei Asia</em> reported that Apple is in discussions with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/05/apple-car-kia-talks-georgia-assembly/\">at least six Japanese automakers</a> over potential supply and manufacturing partnerships, so it sounds like Apple is still in the early stage of negotiations with automakers around the world.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIn any case, it's believed that the Apple Car is still years away from being released, with predictions ranging from 2024 all the way to 2028.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hyundai/\">Hyundai</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/07/hyundai-says-not-in-apple-car-discussions/\">Hyundai and Kia Now Say They Aren&#039;t in Discussions to Develop Apple Car</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hyundai-and-kia-now-say-they-arent-in-discussions-to-develop-apple-car.2283764/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gjmbCg-mYHU:SXSgC3GwDzE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gjmbCg-mYHU:SXSgC3GwDzE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gjmbCg-mYHU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3863b6a8325ad51b248cfaf1ad9877691c9ff26d5e6a56b0a39d44628bc22e45","category":"Apple"}
