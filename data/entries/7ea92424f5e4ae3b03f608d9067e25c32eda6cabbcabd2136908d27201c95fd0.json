Hinault is the most recent French winner of the Tour de France, he won his fifth yellow jersey in 1985.

No other active riders has more than one Tour de France title. Technically, Froome still has a shot at equalling the all-time record of five Tour de France titles. However, Israel Start-Up Nation have announced that Froome will be riding the 2021 Tour de France as a road captain, not a general classification leader.</span></p>\n<p><span>Lance Armstrong had held the record with seven Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005, but was stripped of all his accolades over this period after he was found guilty of doping in 2012.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>5 wins - Jacques Anquetil (1957 - 1964), Eddy Merckx (1969 - 1974), Bernard Hinault (1978 - 1985) and Miguel Indurain (1991 - 1995)</span></li>\n<li><span>4 wins - Chris Froome (2013 - 2017)</span></li>\n<li><span>3 wins - Philippe Thys (1913 - 1920), Louison Bobet (1953 - 55), Greg LeMond (1986 - 1990)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Youngest Tour de France Winners</strong></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-55749636_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624032595\" /></span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>Henri Cornet, the youngest winner of the Tour de France (Image credit: Branger/Roger Viollet via Getty Images)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>One of the recent trends that can be observed in professional cycling is the increased level of opportunity and confidence given to young riders. This means that some of the youngest Tour de France champions in history have won the race in the previous couple of years. Egan Bernal became the third youngest rider to win the Tour de France in 2019 — he was aged just 22 years old and 196 days.</span></p>\n<p><span>The most recent winner of the Tour de France is Tadej Pogačar, who became only the second rider to win the Tour de France aged under 22 — he was crowned champion just one day prior to his 22nd birthday. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, Henri Cornet remains the youngest rider to win the Tour de France. He won the yellow jersey in 1904 by a margin of more than two hours, which was just the second edition of the race. Originally, Cornet was fifth to finish, but the race was riddled with various scandals. After numerous disqualifications, Cornet was handed victory.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>1904 - Henri Cornet, 19 years and 352 days</span></li>\n<li><span>2020 - Tadej Pogacar, 21 years and 365 days</span></li>\n<li><span>1909 - François Faber, 22 years and 187 days</span></li>\n<li><span>2019 - Egan Bernal, 22 years and 196 days</span></li>\n<li><span>1910 - Octave Lapize, 22 years and 280 days</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Oldest Tour de France Winners</strong></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-162199728_1024x1024.jpg?v=1624032735\" /></em></p>\n<p><em>Cadel Evans on the way to winning the 2011 Tour de France (Image credit: Joel Saget/AFP via Getty Images)</em></p>\n<p>Some of the oldest Tour de France victors came in the race's early years too.
