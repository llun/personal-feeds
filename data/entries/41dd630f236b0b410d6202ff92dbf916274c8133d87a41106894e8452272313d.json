The change may be in line with a number of amendments to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s artwork that have taken place <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/07/apple-music-animated-artwork/\">over the last year</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/11/apple-music-animated-album-artwork/\">animated album covers</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe change, first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/m83bgp/did_apple_really_remove_the_profile_pictures_out/\">users on Reddit</a>, appears to have taken place very recently. Some users seem to be unhappy about the change, commenting that the \"profile picture variant made it feel more personal than this.\" Another downside seems to be that when listening to another user's personal radio station now, the only way to tell who the station is from is by a small profile picture in the bottom right-hand corner, rather than from the artwork itself.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/19/apple-music-scraps-personalized-artwork-stations/\">Apple Music Scraps Personalized Artwork for Personal Radio Stations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-scraps-personalized-artwork-for-personal-radio-stations.2288910/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Pi8iFO8xAhA:tB-39SG8Nns:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Pi8iFO8xAhA:tB-39SG8Nns:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Pi8iFO8xAhA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41dd630f236b0b410d6202ff92dbf916274c8133d87a41106894e8452272313d","category":"Apple"}
