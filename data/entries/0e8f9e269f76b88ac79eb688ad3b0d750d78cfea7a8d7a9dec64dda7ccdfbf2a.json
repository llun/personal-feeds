Take for instance their new ultra-packable backpacks. These bags are partially made from upcycled sails and have a 14L capacity that packs down into a tiny store pocket. They weigh 64g and are perfect for overnighters and long tours alike.</p>\n<p><em>Outer Shell collaborated with <a href=\"https://mafiabags.com/\">Mafia Bags</a> to source some of the materials from upcycled sails. Note that the cords come in many different colors so expect minor variations in the bag you receive.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSC02865.jpeg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Available in three colors and for sale for $70.
