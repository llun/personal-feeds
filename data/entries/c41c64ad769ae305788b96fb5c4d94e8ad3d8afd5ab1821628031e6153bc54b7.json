Often lost in a sea of better-known (and better-marketed) cycling helmets and sunglasses, Bolle Brands — the parent company of Bolle, Serengeti (and Serengeti Sport), and Spy Optics — has opted for the third option with two new products developed with an emphasis on long-term sustainability that the company hopes will prompt hesitant buyers to give them a second look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Bolle Eco React MIPS helmet is aimed at the urban and commuter crowd with its integrated hat-like brim and smart styling. But instead of using a typical expanded polystyrene foam liner, a virgin polycarbonate shell, and synthetic pads and straps, the Eco React MIPS’s liner has a 20% natural cork content, the shell uses 40% recycled materials, the pads are made of bamboo fiber, and the straps are constructed using 50% cotton. Even the brim is made of bamboo (and it’s removable, too). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail price is US$180 / £130 / €150.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-503148\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bolle-Eco-React-MIPS-2.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the eyewear front, Serengeti Sport is now offering a range of sunglasses with frames made from Grilamid BTR, an &#8220;amorphous, transparent polyamide&#8221; made from castor oil that can be directly substituted for the more common petroleum-based Grilamid TR90 nylon. According to Serengeti, Grilamid BTR &#8220;offers the same characteristics that frames made with TR90 Nylon offer, which include durability, flexibility, and strength without the use of petrol.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the India-sourced castor oil seeds are claimed to reduce overall CO2 emissions relative to more conventional petroleum-based plastics by &#8220;more than 40%&#8221;. Serengeti has extended that eco-focus to the packaging, too, which is almost entirely recycled or recyclable cardboard with any remaining plastic bits made of recyclable &#8220;Bio-Plastics&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon-1340x754.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-503150\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon-650x366.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon-190x107.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon-1080x608.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serengeti-Sport-Eco-Nylon.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, Bolle Brands’ use of the new Grilamid BTR material is limited too Serengeti’s more casual eyewear offerings, not any cycling-specific offerings under the Bolle brand, although that’s likely to change moving forward. Retail prices start at US$160 / £140 / €150.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australian prices for all of these items are to be confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, none of this stuff by itself is going to &#8220;save the planet&#8221; or anything, but it’s a step in a good direction nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.bolle.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.bolle.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.serengeti-eyewear.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.serengeti-eyewear.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/bolle-brands-announces-new-eco-range-of-helmets-and-sunglasses/\">Bolle Brands announces new &#8216;Eco&#8217; range of helmets and sunglasses</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"James Huang","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"c41c64ad769ae305788b96fb5c4d94e8ad3d8afd5ab1821628031e6153bc54b7","category":"Cycling"}
