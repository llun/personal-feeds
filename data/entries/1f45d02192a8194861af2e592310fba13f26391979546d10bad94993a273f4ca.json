This new model was created with Target's guests in mind, and we'll continue to learn and enhance the experience through future rollouts later this year.</blockquote>The new space, rolling out to 17 Target locations currently, replicates an Apple Store like-experience with custom light fixtures, displays for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, and other Apple accessories.
