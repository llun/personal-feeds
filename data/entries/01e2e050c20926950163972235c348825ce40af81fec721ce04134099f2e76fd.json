When it comes to inequality, however, the pandemic is competing for attention with other indications of the US' problems, with issues ranging from income inequality toÂ <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/derek-chauvin-trial-04-02-21/index.html\">police brutality</a> to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/04/01/stem-jobs-see-uneven-progress-in-increasing-gender-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/\">minority participation in science</a> making headlines.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most striking aspect is that, when polled, a substantial portion of the US public doesn't seem to <a href=\"https://www.uml.edu/News/press-releases/2020/SocialIssuesPoll092220.aspx\">recognize that disparities exist</a>, or they think that dominant groups <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/24/559604836/majority-of-white-americans-think-theyre-discriminated-against\">are victims of discrimination</a>.
