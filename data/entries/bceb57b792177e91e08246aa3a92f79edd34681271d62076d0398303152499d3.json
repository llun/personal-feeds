While the new AirPods may look similar to the AirPods Pro, they are not expected to feature Active Noise Cancellation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"Kang\" also shared their belief that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro will outsell the 11-inch model in 2021, suggesting that the next-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro could have at least one exclusive feature compared to the 11-inch model. Apple is widely rumored to have a new iPad Pro with a Mini-LED display in the pipeline, but most rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mini-led-ipad-pro-release-date-rumor/\">have only mentioned the 12.9-inch model</a>, so perhaps Mini-LED will be exclusive to the 12.9-inch model.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe new 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/03/ipad-pro-5g-a14x-mini-led-2021-rumor/\">faster A14X chip and support for 5G networks</a> on models with cellular connectivity. It's possible these two features could extend to a new 11-inch model, but it's unclear.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"Kang\" recently suggested that Apple plans to host an event <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">on Tuesday, March 23</a>, where the new AirPods and new iPad Pro could be announced. Other products rumored to be in Apple's pipeline include the long-awaited AirTags item trackers, a new Apple TV with more of a gaming focus, and a redesigned iMac powered by Apple silicon, but it's unclear if any of those products will be unveiled this month.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"Kang\" has a nearly perfect track record with Apple rumors, having previously leaked accurate details about iPhone 12 models, Apple Watch Series 6 models, the fourth-generation iPad Air, the HomePod mini, and many other devices in recent months.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kang/\">Kang</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/new-airpods-ready-to-ship-kang/\">Proven Leaker Says New AirPods Ready to Ship, New 12.9-Inch iPad Pro Will Likely Outsell 11-Inch Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proven-leaker-says-new-airpods-ready-to-ship-new-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-will-likely-outsell-11-inch-model.2288086/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XRbCs8oh6YA:oKQJ2wV6AW4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=XRbCs8oh6YA:oKQJ2wV6AW4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/XRbCs8oh6YA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bceb57b792177e91e08246aa3a92f79edd34681271d62076d0398303152499d3","category":"Apple"}
