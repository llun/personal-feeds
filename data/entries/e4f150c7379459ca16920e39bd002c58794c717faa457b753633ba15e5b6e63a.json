The change will go into effect as early as Tuesday, and employees have been told that they won’t be required to ask customers for verification of vaccination.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWorkers will still need to wear masks at stores, Apple told staff. The company could change its plans or delay the loosening of the restriction. The requirement for face coverings will also be dropped at some of the Cupertino, California-based company’s U.S. offices, according to a memo sent to corporate employees.</blockquote>Apple last month told retail employees that mask requirements would stay in place following updated guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which states that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask outdoors or in the majority of indoor settings.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn an internal memo obtained by <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple says that thanks to the progress that has been made in the U.S., it can now safely begin \"moving to the next phase of resumption and will begin to operate under Phase 3 onsite protocol.\" Phase 3 protocol, according to the memo, includes Apple protocol being updated to \"permit optional masking for vaccinated individuals.\" Physical distancing requirements are also being \"relaxed.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs part of the return to normalcy, Apple also plans to begin a slow transition to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/02/apple-employees-returning-to-work/\">moving back to in-person work at Apple Park this fall</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/13/apple-stores-dropping-mask-requirement/\">Apple Stores to Drop Mask Requirement for Vaccinated Customers This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stores-to-drop-mask-requirement-for-vaccinated-customers-this-week.2300757/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uAzZhsCIdtg:nKrcb1wuiKE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=uAzZhsCIdtg:nKrcb1wuiKE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/uAzZhsCIdtg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e4f150c7379459ca16920e39bd002c58794c717faa457b753633ba15e5b6e63a","category":"Apple"}
