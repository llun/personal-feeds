He initially went clear in a big group that came together early on the longest stage of this year’s Tour.</p>\n<p>Then he distanced everyone over the lumpy second half of the course to finish 80 seconds clear of Jasper Stuyven and 100 ahead of what was left of the chase, which included race leader Mathieu van der Poel and lifelong shadow Wout van Aert.</p>\n<p>But there were plenty of other sub-plots to savour on another fascinating day of racing – the last before the Tour enters the mountains proper over the weekend.</p>\n<p>There was the sight of the main break of the day containing both the yellow jersey of Van der Poel himself – defending the only way he seems to know how, by attacking – and the green jersey of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\">Mark Cavendish</a>, who duly mopped up the points in the intermediate sprint before slipping back, his job done for the day.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8632/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9838/gallery-bikes-of-the-tour-de-france-2021\">Gallery: Bikes of the Tour de France 2021</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nThen there was major GC threat Richard Carapaz of Ineos Grenadiers, who launched a big attack from the peloton on the steeper ramps of the final big climb of the day inside the last 20km, just as we had the shock sight of seeing Primoz Roglic going in the opposite direction and being dropped.</p>\n<p>Carapaz gave it his all, and his gap was as wide as 40 seconds at one point, but with Movistar riding hard in pursuit he was caught metres from the line.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel and Van Aert now sit first and second overall, the latter supplanting Pogacar, who slips to fifth, now 3:43 down but still the leading GC contender.</p>\n<p>Here’s the pick of Cyclist photographer Chris Auld’s images from the day’s action:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9826/tour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 41</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/chris_auld_stage_7_03_0.jpg?itok=ptc5_2DA\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>41</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9826/tour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery\">Tour de France 2021 Stage 7 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>3 Jul 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9826%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%207%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9826%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%207%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9826%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Tour%20de%20France%202021%20Stage%207%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9826%2Ftour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9826/tour-de-france-2021-stage-7-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 41</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/07/chris_auld_stage_7_03_0.jpg?itok=ptc5_2DA\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9b00c598d261c2cd54c8bf9236b99ba315d7af88f39a31e1ba2d7ae551731666","category":"Cycling"}
