Stacksmashing demonstrated this by reprogramming an AirTag to pass a non-Apple URL while in Lost Mode.</p>\n<h2>Lost Mode gets a little more lost</h2>\n<p>When an AirTag is set to <a href=\"https://the8-bit.com/airtag-will-interact-with-any-nfc-capable-smartphone-to-view-a-lost-mode-message/\">Lost Mode</a>, tapping any NFC-enabled smartphone to the tag brings up a notification with a link to found.apple.com. The link allows whoever found the lost object to contact its owner, hopefully resulting in the lost object finding its way home.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763811#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763811&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9bae5362a817f1d4e8269b073e96de13eca2aaaeb456ce901f2d4965230a097","category":"Tech"}
