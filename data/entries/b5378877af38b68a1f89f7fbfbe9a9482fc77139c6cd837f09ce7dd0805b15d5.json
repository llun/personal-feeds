After NTT decided that it would not continue in the role of title sponsor, the team spent months searching for a new partner. The squad ultimately stayed afloat thanks to the arrival of Assos as a co-title sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, the Qhubeka charity, with which the team has partnered for years, will remain a part of the name alongside new arrival NextHash. The team is set to reveal its new kit at Thursday’s Tour de France team presentation.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/qhubeka-assos-becomes-qhubeka-nexthash-with-lengthy-new-sponsorship-deal/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b5378877af38b68a1f89f7fbfbe9a9482fc77139c6cd837f09ce7dd0805b15d5","category":"Cycling"}
