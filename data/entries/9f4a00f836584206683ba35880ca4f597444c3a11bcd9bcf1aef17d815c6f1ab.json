More importantly, the company fixed a zero-day vulnerability that hackers were actively exploiting to install malware without triggering core Mac security mechanisms, some that were in place for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Together, the defenses provide a comprehensive set of protections designed to prevent users from inadvertently installing malware on their Macs.
