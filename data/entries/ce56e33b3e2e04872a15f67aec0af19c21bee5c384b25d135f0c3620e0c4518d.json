With an image bolstered by halo cars like the M3, the small BMW four-door was the car to have, particularly if you enjoyed driving. But for the last few years, it has felt like BMW has been missing some of its mojo. The German company built up early expertise in electrification but failed to capitalize on it, ceding a lot of ground to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/the-tesla-model-3-reviewed-finally/\">Tesla's Model 3 electric sedan</a> as BMW instead built a bewildering array of crossovers with ever-larger kidney grilles.</p>\n<p>BMW got a new CEO <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/bmws-big-electric-car-push-selling-2-million-new-evs-by-2025/\">and an order to amp up the electrification effort</a> in 2019, and now the results of that project are right around the corner. Obviously, a lot will depend on how the car drives, but BMW just brought one of its new electric i4s to Washington, DC, and after having a good poke around, I can say that Bavarian Motor Works has its groove back.</p>\n<p>My thesis can be boiled down pretty simply: the car looks good, the specs look good, and the price looks good.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773491#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773491&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
