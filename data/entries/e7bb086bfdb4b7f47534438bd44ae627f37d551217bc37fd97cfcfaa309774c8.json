That means that\nApple will stop making the 5.4-inch iPhone mini starting from next\nyear — there will still be an iPhone 13 mini in 2021, but it’s\nexpected to be made in lower quantities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Say it ain’t so — I love the Mini.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here are some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1382785384648695815\">not-so-good usage numbers</a> from David Smith. But I’ll offer one reason to hold out hope. I think you need to see and feel the iPhone 12 Mini to truly grok just how much smaller and lighter it is, while still having the same A14 chip and same camera system as the regular iPhone 12. Yet almost no one has been able or willing to go to stores to play with phones since it’s been out because of the pandemic. You tell people it’s 5.4 inches diagonal instead of 6.1 and sure, that sounds smaller. But you pick it up and hold it and use it and it’s like, <em>Holy shit, this is so nice and small</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/15/kuo-iphone-mini\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e7bb086bfdb4b7f47534438bd44ae627f37d551217bc37fd97cfcfaa309774c8","category":"Tech"}
