The continued trend threatens to further drag out the devastating pandemic. It also now <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/biden-shifts-strategy-as-national-vaccination-rate-continues-to-slow/\">imperils a goal set just last month by President Joe Biden</a> to have 70 percent of American adults vaccinated with at least one dose by July 4.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the country’s seven-day average of doses administered per day was again below 1 million, where it has been now for several days. The average hasn’t been this low since January 22. In mid-April, the average peaked at nearly 3.4 million doses a day, following a record of over 4.6 million doses administered in a single day.</p>\n<p>With less than a month to go until Independence Day, there’s a real possibility that the US will fall shy of Biden’s 70-percent goal. Currently, about <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">63.7 percent of adults</a> in the country have received at least one dose. But a chunk of daily doses are now going to adolescents ages 12 to 17, who <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/05/fda-authorizes-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-for-12-to-15-year-olds/\">became eligible for vaccination last month</a>. And total vaccination numbers are still on a significant decline. If current trends hold, the US may only have about <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/06/07/covid-vaccine-variant-cdc-world-health-organization/7576680002/\">67 percent</a> of adults vaccinated with at least one dose by the Fourth of July, according to one analysis conducted by USA Today.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771195#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1771195&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c9d4becc4709f8fe1016dd4f9b4b87317ae4211a626e34391e6d225a7dcf79b","category":"Tech"}
