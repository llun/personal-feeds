It can run a router or a cable modem to keep you connected, or run lights and other accessories when you're out camping.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere's a handle that makes the Jackery Explorer 500 easy to carry, and there are built-in fans to keep it cool. An LCD screen on the front displays the current power level and the watts that are being drawn so you can keep track of your power usage.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/jackery-e500-charging-macbook.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-777025\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nJackery will soon celebrate Jackery Day, which will see brand new power station models <a href=\"https://www.jackery.com/pages/jackery-day\">coming out on March 17</a>.
