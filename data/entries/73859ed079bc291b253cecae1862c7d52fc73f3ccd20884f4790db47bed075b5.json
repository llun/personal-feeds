Phone-makers can customize the chips so they do additional things like handle SIM unlock requests. The chips run in 31 percent of the world's smartphones, according to <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/foundry-supply-constraints-competition/\">figures</a> from Counterpoint Research.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/how-security-flaws-work-the-buffer-overflow/\">heap overflow</a> the researchers found can be exploited by a malicious app installed on the phone, and from there the app can plant malicious code inside the MSM, Check Point researchers said in a <a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/05/06/android-users-privacy-at-risk-as-check-point-research-identifies-vulnerability-on-qualcomms-mobile-station-modems/\">blog post</a> published Thursday. The nearly undetectable code might then be able to tap into some of a phone’s most vital functions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763019#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1763019&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73859ed079bc291b253cecae1862c7d52fc73f3ccd20884f4790db47bed075b5","category":"Tech"}
