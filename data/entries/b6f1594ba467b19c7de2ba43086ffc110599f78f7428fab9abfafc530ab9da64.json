The developer isn’t running the online casinos. He’s just showing the casino websites in a web view, and collecting new user bonuses when people sign up through his embedded affiliate code.</p>\n\n<p>Countdown until this app is removed from the App Store in 3… 2… 1…</p>\n\n<p>(Pedantic note, but no real-money casino could ever use Apple’s in-app purchases. App Store developers get paid by Apple monthly (a whole ‘nother issue — Stripe can pay out weekly or even daily). Real-money online casinos only accept instant irrevocable transfers.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/15/eleftheriou-turkish-casino-app\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b6f1594ba467b19c7de2ba43086ffc110599f78f7428fab9abfafc530ab9da64","category":"Tech"}
