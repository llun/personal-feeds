They outlined their findings in two separate papers, one <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.13730\">published last fall</a> in the journal Functional Ecology and the other <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.2898\">published last month</a> in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.</p>\n<p>Intraspecies battle is commonly found in nature, usually over competition for limited resources (mates, food, or shelter). According to the authors, it's generally been assumed that whichever creature inflicts the most damage wins the fight. That's one possible explanation for why so many species have evolved various defensive structures to protect them from damage during a fight. For instance, goats have <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3798378?seq=1\">dermal shields</a>, crocodiles sport <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoderm\">dorsal osteoderms</a>, and mantis shrimp boast <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0203\">armored telsons</a>. But do these structures actually influence the outcomes of fights?</p>\n<p>\"Biologists have generally assumed that the individual who inflicts more damage on their opponent will be more likely to win a given fight,\" <a href=\"https://news.arizona.edu/story/battling-bugs-help-solve-mysteries-weapon-evolution\">said co-author John J. Wiens</a> of the University of Arizona while explaining the reasoning behind Bug Fight Club. \"Surprisingly, this fundamental assumption had yet to be tested in an experimental study.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740335#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1740335&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"90d27812f7b5861c48a4a0abce3a72b7a011eacbc54e87ad3ca3c0f62a4e193b","category":"Tech"}
