This particular model is the Vaya “3” stock frame. It’s an all-around adventure machine suited for just about everything – commuting, touring, gravel, pavement, you name it. I love the versatility and have evolved the build over the last few years with a few modern changes here and there.</p>\n<p>I still remember test riding a Vaya at Montlake Bicycle Shop back in 2012, and it completely changed how I thought of cycling and what could be possible on a drop bar bike. I had been riding skinny tire carbon fiber road bikes, and I felt restricted on the type of riding I could realistically do on them. This bike opened the doorway into a whole new world of cycling adventure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSCF4168.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The bike was purchased new in 2013 from Huckleberry Bicycles out of San Francisco. I love the brick red frame and have kept the gold Salsa skewers that came with the original hubs that Salsa spec’d the bike with. Looking back, this bike was ahead of it’s time and has allowed me to shape it into what it is today.</p>\n<p>The stock build can be found at <a href=\"https://salsacycles.com/bikes/archive/2013_vaya_3\" target=\"_blank\">Salsa’s archives</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSCF4119.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSCF4268.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSCF4163.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Anyway, enough background and onto the current build:</p>\n<p>Frame: Vaya 3 CroMoly<br />\nFork: Vaya, Cromoly, 1-1/8″<br />\nSize: 58 cm</p>\n<p>Front Der: n/a<br />\nRear Der: Shimano RD-M7000 SLX<br />\nCrankset: Shimano GRX 810 1×11<br />\nCassette: SunRace CSMX8 11-46T (11 speed)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSCF4120.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/05/DSCF4157.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Headset: Chris King<br />\nStem: Simworks<br />\nHandlebar: Crust Towel Rack v2 small<br />\nBartape: Camp and Go Slow Western Rattler<br />\nShifter: Microshift BS-M11 Bar End<br />\nBrakes: Avid BB7 Road S<br />\nBrake Lever: TRP RRL w/ Gum Hood replacement<br />\nSeatpost: Nitto S92<br />\nSaddle: Brooks B17 Brown<br />\nTires: F:Ultradynamico Rose 650×47.99 \\ R: Ultradynamico Cava 650×47.99</p>\n<p>Front Hub: Shutter Precision PD-8 Dynamo<br />\nRear Hub: Velocity ATB Disc<br />\nLight: Sinewave Cyles Beacon Custom – Silver body w/brown caps<br />\nRims: Velocity Cliffhanger 650b</p>\n<p>Front Bag: Swift Industries Fabio’s Chest (Size: Small) w/two Swift Industries Rando Pockets<br />\nRear Bag: Swift Industries Bandito (Coyote)</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
