Windows currently only supports SBC codec and aptX for Bluetooth devices.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Enjoy premium audio streaming quality wirelessly on your Bluetooth headphones and speakers with AAC codec. Short for Advanced Audio Codec, AAC is a lossy codec that delivers high quality audio streaming in smaller files – great for listening to music online.</blockquote>Alongside AAC support, the Windows 10 update will make it easier to select Bluetooth headphones, speakers, and earbuds from the Windows bar. As Microsoft describes:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>No more clicking through multiple audio endpoints to make your Bluetooth headset's voice and mic work properly. We now only expose one audio endpoint in the UI and will switch to the correct one automatically for you for a seamless experience. Listening to Spotify and then have to hop onto a Teams call? You can also now directly control the volume of your headset</blockquote>The new features, accompanied with bug fixes and improvements, will be available to all Windows 10 users later this year. However, members of the Windows Insider program can receive a beta with the new additions with Preview Build 21370.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows-10/\">Windows 10</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/30/windows-10-update-improved-airpods-support/\">Windows 10 Gaining Improved Audio Support for AirPods in Future Update</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OvB_C9f6HqI:DEod7CxVSXI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=OvB_C9f6HqI:DEod7CxVSXI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/OvB_C9f6HqI\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a60fba2950724e6ba6a91ea1f20baf563af6ef0809a79b976b692ca8d9c6a29","category":"Apple"}
