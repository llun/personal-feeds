The April 2021 security update for the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a (5G) came with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/105130965\">a note</a> saying that it includes \"performance optimizations for certain graphics-intensive apps &amp; games.\" Hands-on testing reveals the update apparently dramatically improves the Pixel 5 GPU, reportedly showing performance gains of up to 50 percent in some apps and benchmarks.</p>\n<p>We don't have a Pixel 5 on hand to test, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suka_hiroaki/status/1379153849559179264\">Andreas Proschofsky</a> from Der Standard tipped off the Internet that he's seeing \"30-50 percent better\" performance in 3DMark after the update. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreif7/status/1379143336943058952\">Andrei Frumusanu</a> from Anandtech confirmed \"performance has been essentially doubled from the scores published [in <a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16442/the-google-pixel-5-a-minireview/3\">Anandtech's review</a>], and in line or better than other 765G phones,\" adding that \"the fact it took 6 months is sad, though.\" Hmm. Yes.</p>\n<p>It might seem impossible to add 50 percent better performance from a mere software update, but Google is just fixing the terrible state of the launch phone. There was simply that much room for improvement relative to other phones. When <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/pixel-5-review-google-spends-its-bill-of-materials-budget-unwisely/\">we reviewed</a> the device, we called it \"the world's slowest Snapdragon 765G phone,\" noting that other Snapdragon 765G smartphones like the OnePlus Nord could wipe the floor with the device in head-to-head GPU benchmarks. It wasn't a great look for the Pixel 5, which was already facing a switch to mid-range hardware that meant it would be slower than the Pixel 4. Benchmarks allow us to put exact numbers on the changes, but this isn't a trick of benchmarking; the numbers reflected real-world performance when it came to 3D gaming, which was terrible on the Pixel 5.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754819#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754819&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"361d260cb48821ce458f2d444bdcbbcbe8864141801e24e4bf8063856b1f8531","category":"Tech"}
