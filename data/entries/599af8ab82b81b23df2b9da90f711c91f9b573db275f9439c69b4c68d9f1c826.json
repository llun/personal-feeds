The new program, somewhat like Walmart's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/walmart-takes-aim-at-amazon-prime-launches-september-15/\">Walmart+</a>, takes aim at Amazon's immensely popular Prime membership service—but does so while focusing on Best Buy's own corporate strengths, in addition to the usual free shipping perks.</p>\n<p>For $200 per year—or $180, for Best Buy credit card holders—Beta members get unlimited Geek Squad tech support, included extended protection (up to two years) on most purchases, free standard shipping, and free installation for most products and appliances. There's also a 24/7 \"concierge\" service available exclusively to Beta members by phone, chat, or email.</p>\n<p>The details Best Buy's corporate <a href=\"https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-piloting-paid-membership-program-in-select-markets/\">announcement</a> provides about the concierge service are slim, but it sounds like a sort of generic \"niece or nephew who's good at technology\" who can can answer questions.
