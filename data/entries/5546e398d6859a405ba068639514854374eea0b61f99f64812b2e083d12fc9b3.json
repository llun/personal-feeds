{"title":"Some iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 Models Losing Color From Aluminum Body","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/iphone-12-aluminum-color-issues/","date":1615827747000,"content":"Some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> models have been losing color from their aluminum chassis, according to a new report from <em><a href=\"https://svetapple.sk/english/does-apple-have-a-problem-the-color-disappears-from-the-aluminum-chassis-of-the-iphone-12-and-other-models/\">Svetapple.sk</a></em>, which includes photos of a PRODUCT(RED) &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; model that has been noticeably leached of color.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/iphone-12-red-color-fading.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1223\" height=\"688\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788930\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe side of the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; near the power button has faded to an orange shade and there's a clear delineation where the red coloring has worn off.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>Svetapple.sk</em> says that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> has been used in a transparent case, so friction from a hand has not been a factor, though it's not clear if the case itself may have caused the issue.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere have been similar reports of fading from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> 2 users. <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/red-iphone-11-issue.2240815/\">t101</a>, for example, shared photos of an &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; with a dramatic loss of color on the edges. That &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model had also been in a transparent case. While many of the reports have focused on the Red &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, the fading has been seen less frequently on &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj; models in different colors.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSome <em>MacRumors</em> readers speculated that the color fading is due to UV exposure enabled by the clear case, but the problem would likely be more widespread if it was a UV exposure issue. There has also been speculation that the issue could be caused by a chemical reaction with a case, but there's no clear cut explanation.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere are a limited number of reports about color fading, but this is a problem that seems to have <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250202390\">persisted for years</a> as there are complaints about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/\">iPhone XR</a>, too. Aside from the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; photos shared by <em>Svetapple.sk</em>, we have not seen similar reports about color loss on other &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; devices, and this could be a manufacturing defect that's not widespread.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple likely considers the color fading to be a cosmetic issue, so it's not known if devices that are suffering from color loss will be replaced.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/iphone-12-aluminum-color-issues/\">Some iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 Models Losing Color From Aluminum Body</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-11-and-iphone-12-models-losing-color-from-aluminum-body.2288385/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JNTcg-lTOEA:4qCu9u1-a78:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JNTcg-lTOEA:4qCu9u1-a78:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JNTcg-lTOEA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5546e398d6859a405ba068639514854374eea0b61f99f64812b2e083d12fc9b3","category":"Apple"}
