Heading into the final stage, a 30km time trial in Milan, Caruso is set to finish second at the Giro.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2021: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9247/womens-tour-2021-postponed\">Women's Tour 2021 postponed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 114: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAfter Landa crashed out of the race on Stage 5, Caruso had an opportunity he has never previously been afforded, the chance to race for himself. As he told the press yesterday, having taken his first-ever Grand Tour stage victory, he took that chance with both hands.</p>\n<p>'The biggest difference between being a gregario and a leader is the pressure that you have to get a result. When you’re the leader, you know everything hinges on you. As a gregario, I had a job to do, but nobody would ever ask me why I hadn’t won. That changed on this Giro, but I didn’t. I just threw myself into this challenge, which was above all a challenge for myself,' said Caruso.</p>\n<p>'After the stage on the gravel at Montalcino, I was still up there and I started to think to myself, why settle? I’ve spent a life settling. Why not try to risk? What did I have to lose? Why not look for something more?'</p>\n<p>Below the best images from Stage 20 from Chris Auld:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9684/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery#3\"><p><span>Image 4 of</span> 24</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giroditalia2021-stage19-5_0.jpg?itok=kadvHUmr\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 4 of </span>24</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/9684/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery\">Giro d'Italia 2021 Stage 20 Gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>30 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9684%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2020%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9684%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2020%20Gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9684%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Giro%20d%27Italia%202021%20Stage%2020%20Gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F9684%2Fgiro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/9684/giro-ditalia-2021-stage-20-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 24</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/giroditalia2021-stage19-1_0.jpg?itok=8sMP2yNs\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0787792842f998962e7ff7dee1a8f3617beb66332683f7238a93ac23075af57b","category":"Cycling"}
