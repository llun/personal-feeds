Since relocating to Santa Fe last March, we&#8217;ve been looking for an office to run the webshop out of and to solidify the life/work balance. We finally found one, only a short bike ride from our house, so we&#8217;re going to be spending the day moving into it. We&#8217;ll see you back tomorrow with plenty of Radar and great Reportage to whet your appetite. I hope you can enjoy this day off.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"cf560982759ebe04ba5c61e1baa2ee9e3c9a6669eec781a5dd8b70c8521f9b13","category":"Cycling"}
