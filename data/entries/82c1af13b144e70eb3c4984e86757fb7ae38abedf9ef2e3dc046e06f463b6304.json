It signifies the leader of the points classification at the Tour de France. </span></p>\n<p><span>Points are awarded at stage finishes and intermediate sprints. Currently, 50 points are given to the stage winner on a flat stage and 20 points are given to the winner of each intermediate sprint. Less points are awarded at the finish line on hilly and mountain stages, which means the sprinters start with the best chance of winning the points classification.</span></p>\n\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021-standings\">Current Tour de France standings</a></strong></em></p>\n<div></div>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/tour-de-france-2021\"><b>Tour de France 2021 Guide</b></a></em></p>\n<p><span>Joining the breakaway can be a great method to gain an upper hand in the green jersey. This way, competitors can reach intermediate sprints ahead of their rivals. However, this tactic often requires climbing skills and powers of recovery, something that not all sprinters possess in abundance. Therefore, the eventual winner of the green jersey must be a somewhat complete rider and not simply the fastest sprinter.</span></p>\n<p><span>To win the green jersey, the victor must complete all 21 stages of the Tour de France. This means the winner must be able to cross the highest mountains within the time limit and <span>recover well between stages</span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>The green jersey was introduced at the 1953 Tour de France. The winner that year was Fritz Schär. In stark contrast to the modern profile of green jersey winners, </span>Schär came third in the overall general classification the following year.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1174265224_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625494613\" /></p>\n\n<p><em><span>Fritz Schär at the 1953 Tour de France.

The eventual winner that year was Franco Bitossi, though the colour of the jersey reverted to green only one year later, in 1969, and has remained green since.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/mark-cavendishs-transcendent-win\">Related – Mark Cavendish's transcendent win</a></strong></em></p>\n<h4><b>Winners of the Points Classification / Green Jersey</b></h4>\n<p><em><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/20190710TDF0006-A.S.O._Alex_BROADWAY-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625328124\" />Cover image: <span>A.S.O./Alex BROADWAY</span></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Peter Sagan - 7 (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019)</span></li>\n<li><span>Erik Zabel - 6 (1996,1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001)</span></li>\n<li><span>Sean Kelly - 4 (1982, 1983, 1985, 1989)</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Peter Sagan has won the points classification seven times, more than any other rider.
