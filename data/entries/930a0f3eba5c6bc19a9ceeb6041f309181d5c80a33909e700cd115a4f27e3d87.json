The lawsuit was filed by VLSI Technology LLC, a 4-year-old firm that Intel says has no products and no sources of revenue besides patent litigation.</p>\n<p>The patents at issue in the case previously belonged to NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch company that spun off from Philips in 2006. NXP acquired the patents when it bought Freescale Semiconductor (itself a spinoff of Motorola) in 2015. Intel's lawyer <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/intel-told-to-pay-2-18-billion-after-losing-texas-patent-trial\">told jurors</a> that NXP would get a portion of the proceeds from the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>The two patents focus on methods for minimizing the power consumption of computing chips. One way to do this is by varying the system voltage: setting a higher voltage when high performance is needed, then lowering the voltage to conserve power afterwards. One <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US7523373B2/en\">patent</a> claims the concept of storing information about a memory chip's minimum voltage in nonvolatile memory so the system can ensure that the memory circuit has a high-enough voltage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746490#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1746490&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
