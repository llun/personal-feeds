The GPS is now just as much a dedicated training tool and ride tracker as it once was a navigation unit.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> GPS cycling computers are now packed with features that improve training as well as navigation.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>GPS bike computers are now also hitting price points that rival basic bike computers. Using GPS technology to provide speed and distance information means it’s no longer necessary to use wheel-mounted magnets and sensors, so switching the computer between bikes has never been easier.</p>\n<p>The cycling GPS market is dominated by similar brands to the automotive GPS industry. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/garmin-edge-bike-computers-buyers-guide-to-all-the-models/\">Garmin</a> is the key player, but brands such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/wahoo/\">Wahoo</a>, Polar, Bryton, Suunto, Leyzyne and CatEye also offer GPS-equipped options.</p>\n<h2>What to consider when buying a GPS device for cycling</h2>\n<h3>Navigation or tracking?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Navigation and mapping is useful for riding near home and bikepacking.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest question when choosing a GPS unit is deciding whether you want it to guide you on a ride via maps and navigation, or if you simply want it to track your ride and give you the data to look back at after your ride.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, navigational GPS units will cost more because they feature built-in maps, additional storage, navigation software and often a much larger screen to make use of all of this information.</p>\n<p>Devices that offer mapping and directional guidance have come a long way. GPS accuracy has greatly improved, guiding you to within one or two metres of a desired location.</p>\n<p>Far more tracking GPS units are sold than those that include navigational aids. For most riders, all they want is live ride data with the option to undertake detailed analysis after a ride.</p>\n<p>However, they don’t offer nearly as detailed navigational information, and often only offer ‘breadcrumb’ navigation, which overlays a simple line over a blank screen for you to follow.</p>\n<h3>Connectivity</h3>\n<p>Mobile phone connectivity is desirable for a number of reasons. The likes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/gps-devices/garmin-edge-1030-plus-review/\">Garmin Edge 1030 Plus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/category/accessories/gadgets/cycle-computers/product/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-review-51034/\">Wahoo Elemnt Bolt</a> offer Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity and share information with compatible phones.</p>\n<p>Many bike computers now include a giddy array of features when linked up to phones and other sensors, including incoming call and text alerts, tracking which allows your riding buddies or family at home to see your location in real-time, and even which gear you are in with electronic drivetrains.</p>\n<p>Bluetooth and ANT+ cycling computers will link up to external sensors so you can pair them with devices such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart rate monitors</a>, cadence sensors, speed or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/\">power meters</a>, and more. This unlocks a whole host of possibilities and can help you step your training up a notch.</p>\n<p>Most high-end cycling computers will also neatly integrate with third-party <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-apps/\">cycling apps</a> such as Strava, TrainingPeaks and Komoot.</p>\n<p>Some will also link with WiFi for automatic uploads, avoiding any need to upload your ride via Bluetooth once you get home.</p>\n<h3>Cycling computer training functions</h3>\n<p>The main and most familiar way cycling computers can aid training is by linking up to a power meter or heart rate monitor,  providing live data about your power output or heart rate during your ride.</p>\n<p>There are benefits and disadvantages to both and many things to consider when deciding whether <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-vs-heart-rate/\">heart or power training is best for you</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond simply providing live readouts for auxiliary devices, some cycling computer brands claim their computers can use this data to establish <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/vo2-max/\">VO2 max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-ftp-and-why-it-matters-for-cyclists/\">FTP (Functional Threshold Power)</a>, as well as provide insight into needed recovery time and training load.</p>\n<p>Various bike computers now come with the option to load workouts and training plans directly onto the computer making structured training an easier affair.</p>\n<p>These plans are either available through brand-specific software (Garmin Connect for Garmin computers, for example) or in some instances through apps such as TrainerRoad and TrainingPeaks.</p>\n<p>Some other features available on cycling computers are framed as training tools but are also useful and enjoyable for cyclists who are just out riding for the fun of it. These include alerts signalling how much longer a climb is and live Strava segments introducing some friendly competition against others or your own personal bests.</p>\n<h3>How does a cycling computer mount to the bike?</h3>\n<p>A key factor, but one that’s easily overlooked, is how the device attaches to the bike.</p>\n<p>Most GPS units attach to either the handlebar or the stem of the bike. Generally speaking, the more common the brand, the more available mounting options there will be.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Outfront mounts are a popular choice, especially with performance-orientated cyclists.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter/Immediate media</i></span></div>\n<p>Garmin is no doubt the leader in this area, with scores of aftermarket mount options allowing you to decide exactly how and where the device sits on your handlebar or stem.</p>\n<p>Gamin and Wahoo use mounts that rely on a quarter-turn twist-lock to hold the computer in place. The 90-degree turn makes it easy to fit your computer but also easy to remove when popping into a shop or cafe.</p>\n<p>Out-front mounts are a popular choice because they put the computer in front of the bar making it easier to look at whilst moving. These mounts also make the cycling computer flush with the bar, giving a cleaner look for the more aesthetically minded.</p>\n<h3>Screen size and display type</h3>\n<p>As a general rule, the larger the screen size, the easier the information will be to read. You’ll also be able to show more information on the screen without having to scroll to another page.</p>\n<p>Of course, the downside is that larger units can be cumbersome, crowd your handlebar, and add extra heft – offending the more weight-conscious riders among us.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new version of the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt has switched from greyscale to a colour display.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For performance and general riding, the <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/category/accessories/gadgets/gps-devices/product/garmin-edge-820-review-vs-edge-520-and-edge-1000-50967/\">Garmin Edge 820</a>’s 2.3in (5.84cm) screen has become something of a benchmark. Most newer devices are this size or larger. For those looking for a truly diminutive option, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/garmin-edge-130-plus-1030-plus/\">Garmin Edge 130 Plus</a> would be our first recommendation.</p>\n<p>Screen size and resolution are a bigger concern if you want to use a cycling computer for routes and navigation. Here, being able to see waypoints and your desired route is crucial, so a screen size of 2.5in (6.35 cm) or larger is advisable.</p>\n<p>Colour displays are becoming the norm, which makes for easy reading, especially with detailed maps.</p>\n<p>Some cycling computers still use a greyscale screen because these can be more readable in bright light, but if Wahoo’s latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-v2/\">Elemnt Bolt</a> is anything to go by this might become less and less common.</p>\n<p>Touchscreens are becoming a standard on newer devices too, because they help simplify toggling menus and selecting desired data.</p>\n<h3>Mapping</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The iOS Garmin Connect app uses Google Maps.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Early GPS cycling computers offered turn-by-turn navigation via a snail trail (also known as a breadcrumb trail).</p>\n<p>Snail trails didn’t really give enough information as they were simply displayed as a single line over a blank screen with no landmarks or surrounding roads detailed, but you could get a fairly good sense of where you were going and were often notified if you drifted off course.</p>\n<p>Now, many cycling computers are preloaded with in-depth maps that are similar to topographic maps detailing roads, landscape, features, waypoints and any amenities. This is particularly useful for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a> but is great even if your cycling somewhere unfamiliar on holiday or close to home.</p>\n<p>Maps often only cover certain territories. For instance, in the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gps-computers/gps-devices/garmin-edge-1030-plus-review/\">Garmin 1030 Plus</a> comes preloaded with maps for Europe and North America but you will have to download maps for other regions.</p>\n<p>Plenty of computers allow you to sync courses from route building apps such as Ride With GPS or Komoot, and in some cases let you drop a pin on the computer’s map and will automatically route you to that location.</p>\n<h3>Battery life</h3>\n<p>Are you looking to complete long rides, multi-day adventures, or simply want to go out and not worry about having to recharge your device between training sessions?</p>\n<p>If any of these sound familiar it is probably worth seeking out a cycling computer with decent battery life. Many computers will have a claimed battery life of between 15 and 20 hours, but this is of course dependent on use.</p>\n<p>External battery expanders can bump up the battery life of your cycling computer if you’re out for a particularly long time.</p>\n<h2>Alternatives to GPS cycling computers</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Smartwatches are alternative to cycling computers with many of the same data functions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>While this buyer’s guide is dedicated to GPS units, there are viable alternatives to GPS cycling computers in the form of GPS watches and smartphones.</p>\n<h3>GPS watches</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-gps-and-smartwatches-for-cycling-how-to-choose-the-right-one-for-you/\">GPS watches</a> will record your cycling data much like a GPS cycling computer. They have the added benefit of having built-in heart rate monitors but don’t have the same mapping and navigation capabilities as many cycling GPS computers.</p>\n<p>If you do more than cycling – for instance running, swimming or indeed triathlon – GPS watches are a good choice for their versatility. But a major downside to these devices is the smaller screen size, so if you’re planning to keep the device on your bike, you’re better off with a cycling-specific unit.</p>\n<h3>Smartphones</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/top-5-smartphone-apps-for-cycle-commuters/\">Smartphones</a> are ideal if you’re looking for a way of navigating around town and don’t want to invest in a dedicated cycling device, or simply dip a toe in the world of GPS navigation and ride recording.</p>\n<p>Smartphones can be used with apps such as Strava and might prove just as useful as a cycling computer for casual riding.</p>\n<p>There are many <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-phone-holder/\">smartphone handlebar mounts</a> and cases available to keep your phone safe and secure whilst riding, but they are likely to be less waterproof than cycling-specific computers. That said, keeping the phone in your pocket or pack remains an option for data collection.</p>","author":"Matthew Loveridge","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"63fd665d602e8edd62e28d7ca85c51a9a64389f46ec671f872d1c8e2067524a1","category":"Cycling"}
