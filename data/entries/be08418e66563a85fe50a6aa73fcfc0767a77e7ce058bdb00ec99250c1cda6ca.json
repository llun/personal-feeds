While this number will clearly move around over the coming months, we believe this speaks to an increased confidence with Cook & Co. that this 5G driven product cycle will extend well into 2022 and should also benefit from a post vaccine consumer \"reopening environment.\" <strong>From a spec perspective, we have increased confidence that iPhone 13 will have a 1 terabyte storage option which is double from the highest Pro storage capacity today (512GB) and will also include a number of enhancements with Lidar across all iPhone 13 models.</strong> </blockquote>Apple leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> last month <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgeTioKF6mU&feature=emb_title\">doubled down</a> on an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1321241186313637888?s=20\">earlier claim</a> that the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup would feature a 1TB storage option. Apple currently only offers this capacity as an option in its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models, but the additional storage would make sense for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> owners, especially those taking advantage of new photography features like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/austin-mann-proraw-iphone-12-demo/\">ProRAW</a>. ProRAW files are 10 to 12 times larger than HEIF or JPEG files, which means users will need a great deal more on-device storage or else pay for larger amounts of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> storage space. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nA previous report has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/lidar-scanner-on-all-iphone-13-models-rumor/\">suggested</a> that Apple will expand its LiDAR Scanner to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup in 2021, rather than only the Pro and Pro Max models, as is the case in the current &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; series.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLooking ahead based on their initial build forecast for &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, Wedbush analysts remain bullish about Apple's prospects in the smartphone market, suggesting the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; could be \"a game changer indicating the supercycle party in Cupertino is going well in FY22.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is predicted to return to its traditional September smartphone unveiling for the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup, which is expected to include the same-sized model options, including a 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini, 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro, and 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro Max. (These names are simply placeholders and could always end up being different.)\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nMajor design changes are not expected, but we can likely count on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/iphone-13-upgraded-ultra-wide-lens-rumor/\">camera improvements</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/tsmc-apple-5nm-plus-4nm-chips/\">faster A-series processor</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/apple-qualcomm-5g-modem-roadmap/\">new 5G chip from Qualcomm</a>. Rumors suggest at least one &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2021 could feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/\">portless design</a> that relies entirely on wireless charging rather than a Lightning port, though it's not clear if this will pan out. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOther rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/14/iphone-13-pro-120hz-display-rumors/\">suggest</a> a 120Hz ProMotion display could feature in this year's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Apple could also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/21/iphone-13-smaller-notch-pro-cameras-larger-cis/\">shrink the notch</a> in 2021, with one rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/07/iphone-13-may-have-a-smaller-notch/\">suggesting</a> a shallower notch with a reduced height rather than reduced width will be added to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is also said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/\">considering adding</a> an in-display fingerprint sensor to the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; models, which would be used in addition to Face ID as an alternate biometric authentication method.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/\">Wedbush</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/wedbush-iphone-13-1tb-storage-lidar/\">iPhone 13 to Include 1TB Storage Option and LiDAR Across the Board, Says Wedbush Analyst</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-to-include-1tb-storage-option-and-lidar-across-the-board-says-wedbush-analyst.2286627/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oCMjvBHQJKU:qnMoGI89fXY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oCMjvBHQJKU:qnMoGI89fXY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oCMjvBHQJKU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"be08418e66563a85fe50a6aa73fcfc0767a77e7ce058bdb00ec99250c1cda6ca","category":"Apple"}
