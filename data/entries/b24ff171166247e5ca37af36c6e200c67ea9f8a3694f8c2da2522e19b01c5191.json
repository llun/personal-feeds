In that regard, Nadella says Microsoft would \"love to make sure that it works better,\" referencing the iPhone and Windows. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe CEO goes on to say that, like other companies, Apple is welcome to doing anything it wants on Windows, including bringing iMessage to the platform. iMessage has been a hallmark of Apple's devices, and despite the Cupertino tech giant <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/facetime-pc-android-users-ios-15/\">partially opening FaceTime to Android and Windows later this year</a>, iMessage remains an Apple product exclusive. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs part of the legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, court filings including internal emails between high-ranking Apple executives <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/09/epic-apple-no-imessage-on-android/\">revealed that at one point in time</a>, Apple had considered bringing iMessage to Android. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the emails, the executives felt that bringing iMessage to a competing platform \"would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\" While not explicitly stating Windows, Apple bringing iMessage to its largest computer competitor could be a business disadvantage. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/\">iMessage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/\">Windows</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-ceo-would-welcome-imessage-on-windows/\">Microsoft CEO Would 'Welcome' Apple to Bring iMessage to Windows</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-would-welcome-apple-to-bring-imessage-to-windows.2302163/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JFKn_4nKfRQ:QWpcbdLauEc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JFKn_4nKfRQ:QWpcbdLauEc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JFKn_4nKfRQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b24ff171166247e5ca37af36c6e200c67ea9f8a3694f8c2da2522e19b01c5191","category":"Apple"}
