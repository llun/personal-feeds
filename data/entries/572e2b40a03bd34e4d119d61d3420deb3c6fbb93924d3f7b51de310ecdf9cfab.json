Can you spot them all?</p>\n<p>The iconic Bauhaus art movement has impacted our ordinary lives in extraordinary ways. Its reach in the modern society is everywhere: From skyscrapers to household objects and even the humble bicycle. It brought art into everyday life and shaped the way we live today. Cycling, too, can be both an everyday affair and an art form.</em>&#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nDate of release: March 2021<br />\nSheet size: 840mm X 594mm (33 inch X 24 inch)<br />\nPrint Quality: Offset Lithographic Printing using 4 Pantone Colours to ensure colour accuracy and a high-quality print.
