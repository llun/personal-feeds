{"title":"Apple's Eddy Cue Reportedly Advising Tom Brady's New NFT Company","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/eddy-cue-advisor-tom-brady-nft-company/","date":1617906464000,"content":"NFL star quarterback Tom Brady is teaming up with entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt to launch a new NFT company called <a href=\"https://autograph.io/\">Autograph</a> this spring, and Apple executive Eddy Cue will serve as an advisor to the company, according to <em><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/06/tech/tom-brady-nft-autograph/index.html\">CNN</a></em>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/eddy-cue-photo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-793139\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAs a Senior Vice President at Apple, Cue oversees many of the company's services, such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Maps, and iCloud. Once a fixture at Apple Events, Cue has maintained a relatively low profile over the last few years, at least in the public eye. One of Cue's last appearances <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/22/british-telecom-5g-iphones-eddy-cue-video/\">was in September 2020</a>, when he praised British carrier EE's launch of smartphone plans bundled with multiple Apple services.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is not uncommon for Apple executives to serve as board members or advisors to other companies, with Cue also sitting on Ferrari's board.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nNFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are the latest cryptocurrency phenomenon. A non-fungible token is essentially a digital commodity like an image that has been authenticated with the same blockchain technology behind Ethereum. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's first-ever tweet sold as an NFT for &#36;2.9 million last month amid the NFT craze.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.myhealthyapple.com/\">MyHealthyApple</a>!)</em><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/\">Eddy Cue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/eddy-cue-advisor-tom-brady-nft-company/\">Apple&#039;s Eddy Cue Reportedly Advising Tom Brady&#039;s New NFT Company</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-eddy-cue-reportedly-advising-tom-bradys-new-nft-company.2291082/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nOzzyUcgIfo:m8TJswdLE6k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nOzzyUcgIfo:m8TJswdLE6k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nOzzyUcgIfo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f1c5a0a494390fc4ab997d162b573f7f6bccb9996078fee2004aba1a83050b8","category":"Apple"}
