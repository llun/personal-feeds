The white car has a 3.0 L straight-six engine and a <em>lot</em> of power, and the yellow car has a 2.0 L four-cylinder with less power.                      [credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/\">Toyota</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>The Toyota GR Supra is a divisive car among enthusiasts. Its fans will point to the fact that it's wild-looking, with similarly wild manners if you know where to look, and all for a price that wouldn't even get you in the door of a Porsche 718. Detractors can't get past the fact that it shares a platform with the BMW Z4 and that it's not available with a manual transmission. Or that it's not even built in Japan, but alongside the German two-seater in Austria. Some might be tempted to split the difference, labeling the Supra \"a land of contrasts.\" Well, forget that. I'm here to tell you that the haters are wrong—the Supra is the real deal.</p>\n<p>We've actually trodden this ground before. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/dont-dismiss-the-2020-toyota-supra-just-because-of-the-bmw-bits/\">When Ars contributor Jim Resnick drove the Supra in 2020</a>, he explained that the realities of the early 21st-century car industry meant that a collaboration was the only way the folks in Toyota's accounting department would sign off. And he was glad they did.</p>\n<p>Even though its turbocharged inline-six cylinder engine was less powerful than when installed in BMW's Z4, the 2020 Supra was more than quick enough. More than that, it was fun to drive, with crisp handling and a traditional approach to front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicle dynamics. Even BMW's iDrive infotainment, masquerading under the name Supra Command, was a welcome bit of badge engineering.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749996#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749996&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
