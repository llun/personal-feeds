Jeff West claimed that she was drunk and fell while he was asleep in bed, but the Health app on his &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; said otherwise.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWest told investigators that he fell asleep around 10:30 p.m. and was in bed until 5:15 a.m., but his Apple Health app showed that he took a total of 18 steps from 11:03 p.m. to 11:10 p.m., a fact that contradicted his claims. Data from Kat West's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; showed that she stopped moving after 10:54 p.m., corresponding to the time when Jeff West claimed to be in bed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWest's fingerprints were also found at the bottom of the bottle that was used to hit his wife in the head. Prosecutors believed that Jeff, a trained crime scene investigator, killed his wife after an argument about her line of work and then staged the scene to make himself look innocent.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nDespite proclaiming that he was uninvolved with the murder, West has been in prison for the past three years as the murder trial has unfolded. He has now been convicted of reckless manslaughter and ordered to serve a total of 16 years.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/\">health</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/apple-health-app-data-crime-investigation/\">Apple Health App Data Helps Send a Man to Prison for His Wife&#039;s Death</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-health-app-data-helps-send-a-man-to-prison-for-his-wifes-death.2284033/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=f9IOMyEIO9E:7mTfZgYxdrQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=f9IOMyEIO9E:7mTfZgYxdrQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/f9IOMyEIO9E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7fe1116004d34f423b568247c810f600d7d9c2a48edc2b14bc16813b4d1659aa","category":"Apple"}
