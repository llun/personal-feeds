The bicycle industry, as you may know, is really feeling it. In the past year, we have seen a tidal wave of people dusting off their old 90’s mountain bikes, or going to their local bike shop to snag that 2021 model, and heading out into the world to see what this two-wheeled miracle has to offer. While it is exciting to see the surge in support towards the bicycle world, the industry frankly wasn’t exactly equipped for the demand that has become the new norm for the time being. This has component lead times reading in years as opposed to their usual months, shipping costs rising to astronomical amounts, and brands (especially smaller ones) attempting to carefully navigate these obstacles and adapt.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07000-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07001-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With the scrambled supply chain, it was unexpected and exciting for us at Crust to have the opportunity to team up with <a href=\"https://www.enve.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE</a> to work on making something special. Having already been big fans of ENVE’s Adventure Fork for its versatility and aesthetic, the idea of offering a Crust frame paired up with it started getting tossed around. Inspired by Hailey Moore (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hailey.m.moore/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">@hailey.m.moore</a>) and her <a href=\"https://crustbikes.com/products/bombora\" target=\"_blank\">Bombora</a> that she put a paint-matched carbon fork on, it seemed the match was already made. A few changes were made to the existing Bombora to accommodate the Adventure fork and freshen the frame up a bit. Once the design changes were made, the plans were signed off, and a long wait ensued.<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07015-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07017-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After a long, LONG wait and some hefty shipping charges, the time has arrived! Miraculously, we are due to have a shipment of frames showing up in the next couple of weeks (if all goes smoothly…fingers crossed). The frames due to come are Bomboras with paint-matched Enve Adventure forks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07004-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07014-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>These Bomboras have undergone a few changes, perhaps the most notable being the tapered EC34/EC44 (1 1/8” to 1 1/2” seat) headtube to nicely match the lines of the ENVE Adventure fork. This version of the Bombora shares the same integrated shaka seat clamp as the Evasion, dainty loop cable guides on the chainstays, and bolt-on brass cable guides under the down tube. The size range, spacing, and geometry of the frame is unchanged minus the ENVE fork’s dropout inserts giving it an adjustable rake of 49 or 55.5 degrees (Axle to Crown of 398 or 406).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC06991-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>We will NOT be doing preorders or “holding” any frames, the three of us are spread thin enough. We will do our best to notify everyone ahead of time as to when the frames will go live on the site in an effort to make sure you have your fair chance at snagging one up. We recommend saving your shipping and billing info into your web browser if you’re really wanting one of these, that way you can make the jump on one.</p>\n<p>XOXO- Crust (Cheech, Matt, and Garrett)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07022-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07020-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07016-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07006-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07011-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC06994-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC06996-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC07002-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/DSC06992-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9e756e2f573c6951289531573f43d22dc36daec67bef534c87982cf438333d86","category":"Cycling"}
