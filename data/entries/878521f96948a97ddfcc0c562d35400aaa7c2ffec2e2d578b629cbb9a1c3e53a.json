Script Debugger is the integrated development\nenvironment that makes that happen by making your AppleScript\ncoding easier, faster, and more transparent. And now Script\nDebugger runs natively on M1 Macs, with full support for universal\napplets, Dark Mode, and themes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For anyone who uses AppleScript seriously, Script Debugger is a veritable bargain at $99 (with generous upgrade pricing for registers users of versions 7 and 6). And even if you’re just an AppleScript tinkerer, Script Debugger 8 <a href=\"https://latenightsw.com/sd8/feature-comparison/\">now has a free-to-use Lite mode</a> that is so much better than Apple’s own Script Editor.</p>\n\n<p>A good rule of thumb: it’s fair to gripe about the various idiosyncrasies and anachronisms in AppleScript, but try using Script Debugger before you complain.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/07/script-debugger-8\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"878521f96948a97ddfcc0c562d35400aaa7c2ffec2e2d578b629cbb9a1c3e53a","category":"Tech"}
