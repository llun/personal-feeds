Uh, it's got a screen in the camera bump?

Filipino YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TECHBUFFPH\">Tech Buff</a> brings us an exclusive leak of the device, which has some pixels where there are not normally pixels. If you're sitting there asking \"why?\" the answer is \"attention.\" The answer is always \"attention.\" We're writing about it right now, so it's totally working!</p>\n<p>Tech Buff ended up taking the video down, but <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-11-ultra-leak-120x-zoom-secondary-screen/\">XDA Developers</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1VIR6lenoU\">a mirror</a> of the video up on YouTube.</p>\n<p>We don't have official specs, a launch date, or marketing info yet, but the phone seems to be a pretty standard 2021 flagship with a Snapdragon 888 SoC. The back features what has to be the world's biggest camera bump, with two big lenses, a \"120x\" periscope camera (that's not the actual optical zoom rating), and an LED flash. Next to all that normal camera stuff is a <em>tiny little display</em>, which seems to be the same aspect ratio as the front display and appears to simply mirror the front display at all times. The video shows the back screen keeping up with the front screen as the user navigates around in a few apps. Hopefully, you can turn it off, too, for privacy's sake.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741863#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741863&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f56f672a9b2bac6095d97ec0d28caa9ecf8fd553bd67b630a128294390463f59","category":"Tech"}
