{"title":"Microsoft’s 2008 ‘I’m a PC’ Ad","link":"https://youtu.be/HrmF-mPLybw","date":1616112290000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/september\">I didn’t care for these spots when they were new</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pathetic. So sad. This campaign (which feels utterly unconnected\nto the Seinfeld spots) might as well be titled “Please stop making\nfun of Windows, Apple.” […]</p>\n\n<p>Directly responding to Apple’s campaign is weak. It’s playing\nPepsi to Apple’s Coke, Burger King to Apple’s McDonald’s. It’s an\nexplicit acknowledgement that Microsoft is the second-place brand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In hindsight, I see how the ads were a tacit acknowledgement that they’d dug themselves a hole to climb out of with Windows Vista. Much stronger ads than Intel’s this week — I really doubt there will be any nostalgia for this Intel campaign a decade from now.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/07/08/vista-ads\">There’s also this gem of a comment</a>: “They tell us it’s the iWay or the highway. We think that’s a sad message.”</p>\n\n<p><em>All of this</em> just goes to show how incredibly effective Apple’s 2006-2009 “Get a Mac” campaign was. And it was such a strange concept, really. There’s something ineffable about its effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1372419987894272003\">Via Harry McCracken</a>, who also points out that Apple had two commercials in the campaign that talked about Macs running Windows Vista.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Microsoft’s 2008 ‘I’m a PC’ Ad’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/18/microsoft-2008-im-a-pc\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"71014383a2ff204e4029e05c7e348ffa340d1fba59d950e0547e0e42e799ef1d","category":"Tech"}
