{"title":"Many Vaccinated Transplant Recipients Remain at Risk for COVID","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/opinion/organ-transplant-covid-vaccine.html","date":1622827094000,"content":"\n<p>Candida Moss, in a column (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/opinion/nyt-opinion-oped-redesign.html\">RIP “op-ed”</a>) for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is receiving considerably less attention, however, is that\nnot everyone who is vaccinated will develop antibodies, and many\nof those who don’t are at high risk for the most severe\nconsequences of Covid-19. As a kidney transplant recipient, I am\none of those people.</p>\n\n<p>Until recently, immunocompromised people were excluded from\nstudies of the mRNA vaccines for Covid-19, but data from clinical\ntrials is beginning to emerge. A study of fully vaccinated kidney\ntransplant patients published in April by researchers at New York-\nPresbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center\n<a href=\"https://www.kireports.org/article/S2468-0249(21)01130-X/fulltext\">revealed</a> that 75 percent of kidney transplant patients\nstudied did not develop measurable immunity after both doses of\nthe vaccine. A second study <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852\">published</a> by Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine researchers in May found that only\n54 percent of fully vaccinated organ transplant recipients studied\nhad antibodies. The numbers are different, but both studies showed\nthat immunocompromised people had significantly reduced responses\nto the mRNA vaccines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have “world’s smallest violin, playing just for you” levels of sympathy for anyone who has chosen not to get vaccinated and then gets sick. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/colorado-anti-vaxxer-sheriffs-deputy-dies-of-covid-19-complications-2021-5\">This guy</a>, for example — a 33-year-old Colorado sheriff who filled his Facebook page with anti-vax nonsense about the vaccines causing third arms to grow out of foreheads, and his natural immune system being all he needed to protect himself. He caught COVID and died three weeks later.</p>\n\n<p>But the unvaccinated are putting <em>others</em> at great risk — those who can’t get vaccinated (including children), or, as in Moss’s case, those for whom the vaccines don’t produce antibodies. Our overall nationwide rates are plummeting — thanks <em>entirely</em> to the vaccines — but the infection, hospitalization, and death rates <em>among the unvaccinated</em> are, in some states, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2021/covid-rates-unvaccinated-people/\">still raging</a>. Again, I have no sympathy for those at risk by choice — but profound sympathy for those still at risk with no choice.</p>\n\n<p>It is shameful to choose not to get vaccinated.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/06/04/vaccinated-transplant-recipients\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3c532ceb2df67170ee54df1d6ff654852a4e8c128462c038edd24e35b2a7ede7","category":"Tech"}
