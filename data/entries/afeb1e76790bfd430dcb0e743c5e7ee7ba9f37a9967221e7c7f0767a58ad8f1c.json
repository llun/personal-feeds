You can get all the details on Apple.com.\" The event will likely be a pre-recorded affair without media in attendance and should be live-streamed on Apple's website and YouTube channel.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Siri‌ is not providing the information in all instances and will in some cases simply refer you to Apple's website for information on events, but multiple <em>MacRumors</em> editors and readers have seen the premature information across Apple devices including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple typically sends out press invitations for its digital events around a week before the actual event, so it seems likely that Apple will confirm the event later today. <em>Bloomberg</em> has reported that Apple plans to showcase a brand <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/high-end-ipad-pro-mini-led-production-issue/\">new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with new mini-LED display technology</a> in the middle of this month. \r\n<br />\r\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/siri-apple-event-tuesday-april-20/\">Siri Reveals Apple Event Planned for Tuesday, April 20</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-reveals-apple-event-planned-for-tuesday-april-20.2291512/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6PXV8Fr0hfk:-qvb8-OvjI4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6PXV8Fr0hfk:-qvb8-OvjI4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6PXV8Fr0hfk\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"afeb1e76790bfd430dcb0e743c5e7ee7ba9f37a9967221e7c7f0767a58ad8f1c","category":"Apple"}
