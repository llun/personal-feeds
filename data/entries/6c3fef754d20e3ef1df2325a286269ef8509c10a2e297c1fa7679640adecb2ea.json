This image was pulled from footage of the rover's landing, captured by on-board cameras. A complete video of the dramatic landing sequence may be released as early as Monday after NASA engineers receive more data from Mars.</p>\n\n<p>\"It is exhilarating. It is absolutely exhilarating,\" said Adam Steltzner, the chief engineer for the Perseverance mission, which successfully landed on Mars on Thursday. These kinds of dramatic images, he said, help bring the world along for the ride on missions of exploration.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743889#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743889&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c3fef754d20e3ef1df2325a286269ef8509c10a2e297c1fa7679640adecb2ea","category":"Tech"}
