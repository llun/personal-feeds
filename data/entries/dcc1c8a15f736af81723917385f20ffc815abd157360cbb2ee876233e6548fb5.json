A beautiful piece that seemed very fitting to celebrate 40 years of building bikes. When we were thinking of what<span id=\"more-36467\"></span> we could do that would be special for the year, we started by looking back at what we had done in previous milestone years.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36647 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2082\" height=\"1353\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658.jpg 2082w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-300x195.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-768x499.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-1536x998.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-2048x1331.jpg 2048w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-88x57.jpg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Vamoots-20th-color-flat-copy-2-e1611963728658-1200x780.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2082px) 100vw, 2082px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The 2001 VAMOOTS 20TH ANNIVERSARY LIMITED EDITION ROAD BIKE.</p>\n<p>Starting with the 20th year anniversary in which we produced a road bike edition that had a very unique paint job on fifty of them. This was well before social media and mass amounts of internet reach. It was successful but was limited to those that wanted a road bike that year. During our 20th anniversary we also had a decal that went on every bike out the door that year. To this day we still have owners that seek us out at events and show us their 20th anniversary decal on the seat tube. They are proud and honored to own that edition each one of them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36648 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1955\" height=\"1409\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM.png 1955w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM-300x216.png 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM-1024x738.png 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM-768x554.png 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM-1536x1107.png 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM-82x59.png 82w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2020-08-27-at-10.26.55-AM-1200x865.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1955px) 100vw, 1955px\" /></p>\n<p>In 2010 we produced a 10th Anniversary of the Mooto X YBB, which was celebrating a decade of making 29inch wheels. That bike was built-out with a specific build kit with white and red accents throughout. Again, a full bike that limited participation by our customers to those that wanted a 29er soft tail in a white and red color scheme. It was a show stopper that year in Vegas as I remember and still being ridden on trail to this day.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36655 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-300x300.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-150x150.jpg 150w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-768x768.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-59x59.jpg 59w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-64x64.jpg 64w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-100x100.jpg 100w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8262-1200x1200.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The &#8220;cartoon catalog&#8221; cover of 2006.

We also hosted a party at the HQ in which some crazed Kiwi stayed with us until the keg was gone, or he may have even left with it! During the 25th year we also had a special bottling of wine by Silverado Winery, again, if you know where to look you can find bottles for sale for upwards of 200-300 bucks.

This build had a special motif of a Colorado themed color paint job, ENVE wheels with matching colorway decals, special saddle &amp; bar tape and was offered in limited numbers.  You had to be in the market for a road bike and you had to like the colorway we landed on.  Not everyone’s taste, but still a beautiful build.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36479 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1325\" height=\"958\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1.jpg 1325w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1-768x555.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1-82x59.jpg 82w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5734-Edit-1-1200x868.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1325px) 100vw, 1325px\" /></p>\n<p>So that leads us to the 40th milestone. It&#8217;s a big number. It&#8217;s a HUGE number in the bike world. When we sat down as a small steering group and before we decided on anything, we looked back at the previous special touches we had put on those years along the way. All very special to each owner as well as those here at Moots.  As a group we really felt that whatever we did, everyone that received a bike from us in 2021 should be a part of it. After all, our customers are the reason we are still able to do this over 4 decades. This is how we landed on the head badge that would go on every build. The 40 Anniversary bikes, like those 20th Anniversary bikes with the special paint or special decal will be around in 20 years from now, when we turn, gulp&#8230;..60.</p>\n<p>As we launched the 40th badge to the public in early January we tracked which bike would finish first and receive this special badge. That bike turned out to be a  ROUTT YBB that landed at our dealer/partner STUDIO VELO and is pictured below with full build details.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36476\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit.jpg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit-88x59.jpg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5615-Edit-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Named after the county which we have called home since 1981: Routt County, Colorado.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36470\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit.jpg 1333w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit-39x59.jpg 39w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5553-Edit-800x1200.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The legendary YBB unit built into a modern gravel bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-36469 size-full\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit.jpg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit-88x59.jpg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5549-Edit-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The STANLEY finish does not make for a dull boy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36473 aligncenter\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit.jpg 1333w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit-39x59.jpg 39w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5569-Edit-800x1200.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px\" />The build out for the customer used the ENVE ADVENTURE FORK for the added ability to carry more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-36472\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit.jpg 2000w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit-88x59.jpg 88w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/DSCF5563-Edit-1200x800.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">To top off the bottom end of the bike a titanium crank by Cane Creek.
