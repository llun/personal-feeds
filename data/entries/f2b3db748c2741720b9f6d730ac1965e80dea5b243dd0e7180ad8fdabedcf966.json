(credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"http://blizzard.com/\">Blizzard</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Ahead of this weekend's BlizzCon game-announcement frenzy, two of Blizzard's secrets have sneaked out in the form of a leak. Both revolve around <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/\"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>: one for the latest <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-impressions-leveling-alts-is-about-to-get-a-lot-more-fun/\"><em>Shadowlands</em></a> expansion, and another for the <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> server option.</p>\n<p>In the latter case, 2007's hugely popularÂ <em>WoW</em> expansion pack, <em>The Burning Crusade</em>, will be bolted onto the <em>WoW Classic</em> option inside the Blizzard Launcher starting sometime in \"2021.\" The news comes from <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/0av4M78\">an apparent leak of official BlizzCon press release materials</a>, all formatted with official images and descriptions of what's to come, as found on Blizzard's official servers by users at Reddit's <em>WoW</em> community.</p>\n<p>As with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/wow-classic-announces-testing-schedule-full-launch-on-august-27/\">2019's official <em>WoW</em> vanilla launch</a>, <em>The Burning Crusade</em> will return without any new or special features on top of what originally came with the game. You may recall that this expansion pack included a trickle of content drops while Blizzard maintained it before selling <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/wrath-of-the-lich-king/\"><em>Wrath of the Lich King</em></a> in 2008. Meanwhile, Blizzard's leaked document claims that the original version's update cadence will return: \"Content from the original game will roll out in phases, at a cadence paced for the <em>WoW Classic</em> community. Prepare for the opening of the Black Temple, gear up to confront the gods of Zul'Aman, and gather your allies to face the fury of the Sunwell.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743757#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743757&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2b3db748c2741720b9f6d730ac1965e80dea5b243dd0e7180ad8fdabedcf966","category":"Tech"}
