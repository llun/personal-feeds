Designed with speed in mind, Schwalbe says the G-One R is good for use on light terrain, gravel roads, and asphalt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new tire was formally unveiled on the eve of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/2021-unbound-gravel/\">Unbound Gravel</a>, where it will be ridden by defending champion Amity Rockwell (you can <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/bikes-of-unbound-gravel-amity-rockwells-pinarello-grevil/\">check out here bike here.</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schwalbe has constructed the new tyre using its Super Race carcass. This casing is said to offer a smooth ride with low rolling resistance with high levels of road and off-road grip. Schwalbe adds its V-Guard puncture protection layer under the tread to maintain a level of air holding and durability required for gravel riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the tyre features a closely packed tread pattern that offers a “Boomerang profile.” Where Schwalbe previous gravel tyres have traditionally offered a shallow depth tread, these are noticeably more raised. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new tyres also come with Schwalbe’s Tubeless Easy stamp and are available in 700 x 40 and 45 mm options. No word of 650B options, but that’s expected given the smaller wheel size isn’t so common in gravel racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Huang has a pair in for review, keep an eye out for that in the months to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Schwalbe-G-One-R-5-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Tan sidewalls, works every time!</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Schwalbe-G-One-R-7-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The “Boomerang” profile on the tread is said to improve uphill traction and “rolling behaviour”.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Schwalbe-G-One-R-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Another view of that tread pattern.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Schwalbe-G-One-R-1-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Schwalbe claims the angled side lugs in combination with the Super Race carcass, offers the “best cornering grip”.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Schwalbe-G-One-R-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>.</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/schwalbe-announces-new-g-one-r-gravel-tyres/\">Schwalbe announces new G-One R gravel tyres</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Ronan Mc Laughlin","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"41f2d0575fe84ed301d7c4e517f4bc7808dc7ff4196430b031c6aade0a75e87f","category":"Cycling"}
