A significant contributing factor is that both companies offer cheaper, low-end tablets compared to Apple's &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; line.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n2020 saw millions of students work from home, and strong &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and other tablet sales have largely reflected the new learn-from-home reality. Apple released a new low-end &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; during the year, alongside a redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>. The launch of the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models and Apple's online store in India likely played roles in Apple's market share increase.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/apple-indian-tablet-market-gains/\">IDC: Apple Was Third Largest Seller of Tablets in India in 2020</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/idc-apple-was-third-largest-seller-of-tablets-in-india-in-2020.2286634/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=x3yg-jGosck:8OiJHfqnivc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=x3yg-jGosck:8OiJHfqnivc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/x3yg-jGosck\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f2ddc8f4d32e710c4351ed3cb9a9cbdc3ca432579a9f1430cc3d1431778c0b1","category":"Apple"}
