Although the team received another wildcard invite to the Italian Grand Tour this year, a suspension could preclude their participation, depending on the length of the suspension and the timing.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/police-reportedly-conduct-searches-in-connection-with-vini-zabu/\">Police reportedly conduct searches in connection with Vini Zabù</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"93dad34ee60e6ca1dfa1f78a3b64a01831efca971b3709e058076a23a92193d7","category":"Cycling"}
