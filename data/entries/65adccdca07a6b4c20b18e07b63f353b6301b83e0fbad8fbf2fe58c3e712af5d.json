Trachtenberg, reporting for The Wall Street Journal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Online marketplace eBay Inc. said it is working to prevent the\nresale of six Dr. Seuss books that were pulled earlier this week\nby the company in charge of the late author’s works because they\ncontain offensive imagery.</p>\n\n<p>“EBay is currently sweeping our marketplace to remove these\nitems,” a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. New copies\nof the six books were no longer for sale online at major retailers\nsuch as Barnes &amp; Noble on Thursday afternoon, which put eBay among\nthe most prominent platforms for the books to be sold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1367601051755372548\">Harry McCracken</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ending publication of these books is a reasonable move, but I’m\nnot sure about eBay’s logic here, other than avoiding bad PR.\nUnless it now wants to police its site and remove every old item\ncontaining offensive stereotypes, which would be a LOT of stuff.</p>\n\n<p>(BTW, I would also have been fine with Dr. Seuss Enterprises\nrevising these books to remove the stereotypes. They’ve already\ntampered with the Dr.’s legacy in a zillion ways that bother me a\nlot more.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I agree with McCracken on both points. I mean, you can buy copies of <em>Mein Kampf</em> but not <em>If I Ran the Zoo</em>? Banning books is always a sign of out-of-control zealotry.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘eBay Is Delisting Dr. Seuss Books Taken Out of Print This Week’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/04/ebay-dr-seuss\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"65adccdca07a6b4c20b18e07b63f353b6301b83e0fbad8fbf2fe58c3e712af5d","category":"Tech"}
