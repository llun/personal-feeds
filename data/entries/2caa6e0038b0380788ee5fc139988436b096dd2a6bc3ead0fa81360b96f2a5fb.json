It's known that human children can reason about the physical world, and have sufficient social cognitive skills for cooperative communication by the age of two-and-a-half years. But according to the authors, there is also a growing body of research showing evidence that domesticated dogs share similar social cognitive skills, although possible biological bases for those abilities had not been tested.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769901#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1769901&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2caa6e0038b0380788ee5fc139988436b096dd2a6bc3ead0fa81360b96f2a5fb","category":"Tech"}
