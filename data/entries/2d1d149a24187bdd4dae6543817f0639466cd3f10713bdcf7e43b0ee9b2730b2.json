A Friday evening after a long work week. A fridge full of food but nothing jumps out. A family movie night where no one can agree.

That's why we've created Play Something, an exciting new way to kick back and watch.</blockquote>Netflix says that Play Something will offer a new series or film that's similar to something you've watched before, an episode or film you've seen but might want to watch again if it's been a long time, a series or film on your watch list, or an episode from a show that you've started but haven't finished.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>PLAY SOMETHING will show you:<br /><br />✔️ A new series/film similar to one you've watched before<br /><br />✔️An episode/film you’ve already watched and may want to watch again if it's been a while <br /><br />✔️ An episode from a show you've started but haven't finished (it will pick up where you left off) <a href=\"https://t.co/cVAVkraeOk\">pic.twitter.com/cVAVkraeOk</a></p>— Netflix (@netflix) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1387406467393757188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nPlay Something can be accessed from the login screen when you're choosing a profile, from the main home screen, or from the navigation menu.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNetflix has been testing this feature with some users for the last several months, but it is now rolling out to everyone.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/netflix-launches-play-something/\">Netflix Launches New 'Play Something' Shuffle Feature</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-launches-new-play-something-shuffle-feature.2293740/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NitJ0ybTrng:juHeBpgiROg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NitJ0ybTrng:juHeBpgiROg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NitJ0ybTrng\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2d1d149a24187bdd4dae6543817f0639466cd3f10713bdcf7e43b0ee9b2730b2","category":"Apple"}
