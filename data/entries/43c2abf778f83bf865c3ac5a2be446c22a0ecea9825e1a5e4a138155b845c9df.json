It is stylish. It is limited to 2,000 units.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is &#8230; <a href=\"https://www.shimano.com/en/100th/100works/\">a coffee-table book</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1340\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm-1340x697.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-505140\" srcset=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm-1340x697.jpg 1340w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm-650x338.jpg 650w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm-190x99.jpg 190w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm-1080x562.jpg 1080w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm-16x8.jpg 16w, https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-2.52.56-pm.jpg 1857w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px\" /><figcaption>Image: Shimano.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More specifically, it is the chance to enter a lottery to secure the right to buy a copy of the book, titled ‘Shimano 100 Works’. Successful applicants will find out in early June if they have earned the right to spend 10,000 Yen (AU$119 / US$92, inclusive of international shipping) on the 264-page volume, which Shimano estimates will begin shipping in September. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, extreme close-up photos of shiny vintage fishing reels and bike parts may not be the centennial product you were dreaming of –&nbsp;even if it is perfect-bound, on semi-gloss stock –&nbsp;but it’s what Shimano has decided you deserve* (<em>*the right to enter a lottery to maybe buy</em>,<em> if you&#8217;re very lucky and have &#8220;reached the age of adulthood in the country / region of the sales destination</em>.&#8221;) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking on the bright side, it’s certainly cheaper than a trickle-down Di2 groupset, and more limited than the new 12-speed Dura Ace will be (whenever it actually comes out). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>    <div data-block-name=\"highlight-box\" class=\"highlight-box \" id=\"\">\n    <div class=\"highlight-box__inner-container\">\n\t<em>To secure a headscratching piece of history, sign up for the lottery at <a href=\"https://www.shimano.com/en/100th/100works/\">Shimano.com</a>.
