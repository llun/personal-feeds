Due to the number of accusations over multiple years, the UCI hired Sport Resolutions, an external agency, to investigate the accusations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI Ethics Commission <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/?p=483315&amp;preview=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">found Van Gansen guilty</a> of violating the Code of Ethics in 2020 and handed the case to the UCI Disciplinary Commission to determine Van Gansen&#8217;s punishment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first reports of accusations filed against Van Gansen were in June of 2019. Initially, three separate reports were filed, two by riders and one by the parent of a rider, stating that Van Gansen had violated the Code of Ethics. After these reports became public, six more riders came forward with similar stories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least 10 riders reported an unhealthy working environment under Van Gansen, most of whom remained anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Gansen&#8217;s suspension will run until December 31, 2022. He has said that he no longer wishes to work in women&#8217;s cycling, but if he does wish to work in cycling again when his suspension is up, he will need to take a class about workplace sexual harassment. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/02/patrick-van-gansen-receives-suspension-following-uci-code-of-ethics-violations/\">Patrick van Gansen suspended by UCI following abuse case</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"5ee3e0580fbbdca2fa754cf369723fb8ce0a9852bdd59c51c8c5eb0f43af85a0","category":"Cycling"}
