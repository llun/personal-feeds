It also requires that all numbers in a group call must be manually blocked for the call to be stopped.</p>\n<p>“I got my first facetime spam starting 4 days ago,” one user reported to an <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251234413\">Apple support forum</a> earlier this month. “It has been non-stop, over 300 numbers blocked so far. My 3 year old daughter has been accidentally answering them and going on video without a t-shirt on.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749815#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1749815&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"64b35acd1157ba824cd36e0544122ab10e111e04dcf9796f6052c2ede0edca88","category":"Tech"}
