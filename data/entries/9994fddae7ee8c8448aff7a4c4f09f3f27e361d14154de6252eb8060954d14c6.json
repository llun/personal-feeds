Jobs also oversaw the opening of the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a> locations in 2001, and he established a company culture that Apple still operates under today.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> has said multiple times in the past, Jobs' thinking, unwavering perfectionism, dedication to hard work, and lust for innovation are the \"foundation of Apple.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/steve-jobs-holding-iphone-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1599\" height=\"900\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-745029\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nMillions of lives have been touched by Apple devices, and there are few technology products on the market that have not been influenced by Apple and Steve Jobs in some way, even today. &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; has since taken over for Steve Jobs, and has kept Jobs' legacy alive.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple fans around the world will celebrate Steve Jobs and his accomplishments today, and &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; as always has tweeted in memory of Jobs' birthday.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<div class=\"center-wrap\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Celebrating Steve on what would have been his 66th birthday.
