Pfizer figured out how to stretch scarce\nsupplies of special filters needed for the vaccine production\nprocess by recycling them. Moderna shortened the time it needed to\ninspect and package newly manufactured vials of its vaccine. […]</p>\n\n<p>The increased output should be enough to fully vaccinate 76\nmillion people in the U.S. in March, another 75 million in April\nand then 89 million more in May, according to estimates from\nEvercore ISI analysts. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines\nrequire two doses.</p>\n\n<p>By midsummer, 75% of Americans 12 years old and above should be\nvaccinated, according to Morgan Stanley.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Outstanding news all around. This sort of large-scale industrial effort — both to manufacture the vaccines and get them into arms — exemplifies the U.S. at its best. Sign up and get vaccinated as soon as you can.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Manufacturing in U.S. Races Ahead’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/22/covid19-vaccine-manufacturing\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"894f3fdb88f196d45ff16e8003f10cf48b2cb95b18d261069ff46ba2351508ff","category":"Tech"}
