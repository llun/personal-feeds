Rockley's sensors beam infrared light through a user's skin, much like the existing sensors on the back of the Apple Watch for detecting heart rate and blood oxygen levels.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRockley's disclosure that its biggest client is Apple came about as the company prepares to go public in New York. The company's filings said that Apple accounted for the majority of its revenue over the last two years and that it has an ongoing \"supply and development agreement\" with the company, under which it expects to continue to heavily rely on Apple for most of its revenue.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the growth of Rockley Photonics and the scale of Apple's partnership with the company, it seems to be virtually inevitable that the company's health sensor technology will be coming to the Apple Watch sooner rather than later.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe company has established an office in San Jose, in addition to facilities in Oxford, Cardiff, Cork, and Helsinki. Rockley has said that its next-generation sensors could be in consumer smartwatches and other electronics as soon as next year. This would presumably align with the launch of Apple Watch Series 8 models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUntil now, rumors had indicated that the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/apple-watch-series-7-blood-glucose-monitoring/\">gaining blood glucose monitoring</a>, but Rockley's comments may indicate that the feature has been delayed until 2022. It is also possible that blood glucose monitoring could still come to the Apple Watch Series 7 this year, followed by a significant expansion of Rockley's technology in the device next year with features like blood pressure and blood alcohol monitoring.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/telegraph-co-uk/\">telegraph.co.uk</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/03/apple-watch-blood-pressure-glucose-alcohol/\">Apple Watch Likely to Gain Blood Pressure, Blood Glucose, and Blood Alcohol Monitoring</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-likely-to-gain-blood-pressure-blood-glucose-and-blood-alcohol-monitoring.2294589/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7AVv0ovVMfQ:DKfWKQsRVxU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7AVv0ovVMfQ:DKfWKQsRVxU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7AVv0ovVMfQ\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6809fdde5dc80f5e7dbaedcb538632854d98e739845fd3e438e318ecc40df914","category":"Apple"}
