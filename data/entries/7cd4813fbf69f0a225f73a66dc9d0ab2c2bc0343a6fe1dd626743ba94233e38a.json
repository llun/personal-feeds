It was around eleven o’clock in the\nmorning, and we were on the phone discussing some technical issue,\nI don’t remember what it was. Anyway, I didn’t agree with him on\nsome point, and I explained my reasoning. Bill says, ‘I’ll have to\nthink about that, I’ll call you back.’ Then I get this call at\nfour in the afternoon and it’s Bill continuing the conversation\nwith ‘Yeah, I think you’re right about that, but what about A and\nB and C?’ I said, ‘Bill, have you been thinking about this for the\nlast five hours?’ He said, yes, he had, it was an important issue\nand he wanted to get it right. Now Bill wanted to continue the\ndiscussion and analyze the implications of it all. I was just\nstunned. He had taken the time and effort to think it all through\nand had decided I was right and he was wrong. Now, most people\nhate to admit they’re wrong, but it didn’t bother Bill one bit.\nAll he cared about was <em>what</em> was right, not <em>who</em> was right.\nThat’s what makes Bill very, very dangerous.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I miss Bill Gates at Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackkanter/status/1383494783591583749\">Via Zack Kanter</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/18/ellison-gates\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7cd4813fbf69f0a225f73a66dc9d0ab2c2bc0343a6fe1dd626743ba94233e38a","category":"Tech"}
