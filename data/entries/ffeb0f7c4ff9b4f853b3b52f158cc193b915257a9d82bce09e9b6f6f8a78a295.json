The ‌AirPods‌ 3 are instead expected to be launched \"in a separate virtual event in the early summer timeframe,\" which may be referring to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a>, starting on June 7.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis may explain some of the uncertainty around the launch of the third-generation ‌AirPods‌, with some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">leaked images</a> and reports claiming that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/new-airpods-ready-to-ship-kang/\">launch is imminent</a>, while others have said that they will not enter production <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">until the third quarter</a> of 2021. Nonetheless, it is not clear why Apple would announce new ‌AirPods‌ but not launch them for several months, suppressing the sales of the current model in the process. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>MacRumors</em> will provide live coverage of the \"Spring Loaded\" <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a> both here on MacRumors.com and through our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wedbush/\">Wedbush</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/wedbush-event-ipads-price-increase-and-surprises/\">Wedbush Analysts Say 'Spring Loaded' Event Will Debut New iPads With 'Modest Price Increase,' Along With 'a Few Surprises'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wedbush-analysts-say-spring-loaded-event-will-debut-new-ipads-with-modest-price-increase-along-with-a-few-surprises.2292200/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1Yo-rEjZaTw:3cgULZ0HsWA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=1Yo-rEjZaTw:3cgULZ0HsWA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/1Yo-rEjZaTw\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ffeb0f7c4ff9b4f853b3b52f158cc193b915257a9d82bce09e9b6f6f8a78a295","category":"Apple"}
