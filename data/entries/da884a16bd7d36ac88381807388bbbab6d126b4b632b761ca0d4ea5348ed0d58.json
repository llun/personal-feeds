                                      <p>Having stormed to victory on stage two of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">2021 Tour de France</a>, taking the yellow jersey in the process, Mathieu van der Poel has received a custom-painted yellow Canyon Aeroad CFR to mark his achievement.</p>\n<p>Yellow bikes have become something of a tradition at the Tour with the overall champion often riding a custom steed into Paris on the final stage (here’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/pogacar-bennett-bikes-paris/\">Tadej Pogačar’s yellow Colnago V3Rs</a> from the final stage of the 2020 Tour.</p>\n<p>However, we don’t always see a fully custom-painted bike being ridden by the race leader during the Tour, so van der Poel’s bike getting the treatment after only two stages comes as a bit of a surprise.</p>\n<p>But it is a welcome one, nonetheless, and matches up very nicely indeed with his maillot jaune and yellow <a

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-canyon-aeroad/\">released in October 2020</a>.\n<p>The bike is equipped with Shimano’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-dura-ace-r9100-and-r9150-di2-groupsets-all-you-need-to-know/\">Dura-Ace Di2 R9150 groupset</a>, deep-section Dura-Ace C65 wheels wrapped in Vittoria Corsa Speed tyres (complete with tan sidewalls) and a Selle Italia Flite Boost saddle.</p>\n<p>Bar variations on wheel depth for any given stage and saddle choice, it’s the spec used by the whole Alpecin-Fenix team on their <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-bikes/\">Tour de France bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The bike has the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-aeroad-snapped-handlebar/\">new one-piece cockpit fixed by Canyon</a> after van der Poel’s CP0018 Aerocockpit snapped in a race earlier this year.</p>\n<p>After the breakage, Alpecin-Fenix switched to externally routed handlebars, but the new design means van der Poel has returned to fully internal routing.</p>\n<h2>Dedicated to his grandfather</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike features a touching tribute to van der Poel’s grandfather.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Van der Poel’s custom bike isn’t just a flash affair to celebrate his yellow jerseys – it’s a touching tribute, too.</p>\n<p>The bike includes a dedication to Mathieu van der Poel’s grandfather, Raymond Poulidor, who died in November 2019. Poulidor completed 14 Tours de France on the Mercier Team.</p>\n<p>Loved by French fans, Poulidor was nicknamed “Pou Pou”, and on the underside of the down tube, van der Poel’s bike reads:</p>\n<p>“Allez Pou Pou. 14 Tours, 7 stage wins, 3 second and 5 third steps. Yellow was not meant to be until now. Allez Mathieu.”</p>\n<p>The tribute references the fact that, despite coming so close on many occassions, Poulidor never won the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p>Now van der Poel has done just that on his debut Tour de France.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"da884a16bd7d36ac88381807388bbbab6d126b4b632b761ca0d4ea5348ed0d58","category":"Cycling"}
