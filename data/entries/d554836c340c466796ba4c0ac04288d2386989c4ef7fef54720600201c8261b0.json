Hixson ordered that Apple's subpoena for the data to Valve was valid, however, noted that Apple has \"salted the earth with subpoenas,\" telling Valve \"don’t worry, it’s not just you.\" Apple's original subpoena requested data from Valve about Steam dating as far back as 2015, the judge's ruling however will only require Valve to produce data limited to as early as 2017.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; is in a heated legal battle with Apple over the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and claims that the Cupertino tech-giant locks developers into its ecosystem, and forces them to pay a \"30% tax\" for in-app purchases. Apple's subpoena for data from Valve is one of many that Apple has set forward as it attempts to prove its point that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; as a distribution platform for software is no different than others.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nGavin W. Stok, a lawyer representing Valve in the discovery hearing, urged Judge Hixson to reject the subpoena and not force his company to produce the data. Stok says that Valve is run by a small team and that collecting all the data Apple is requesting would require it to \"dedicate multiple employees working full time,\" and that it would not be able to guarantee the request could be met on time.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple's lawyer, Jay P. Srinivasan, says that the request is doable, and points out that Apple could have requested data on all 30,000 games on the Steam store, but that it instead is only requesting data on 436 games. Apple continued to defend its subpoena, calling Valve a \"prominent player\" in the complete picture of relevant markets like the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAhead of what is expected to be a heated court hearing set for July 2021 between Apple and &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;, Valve has until mid-March to produce the data. We've reached out to Valve for a comment on the judge's ruling and will update the page once we hear back. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/valve/\">Valve</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steam/\">Steam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/valve-apple-data-request-for-epic-games-case/\">Valve Ordered to Give Apple Information on 436 Steam Games As Part of Epic Games Legal Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/valve-ordered-to-give-apple-information-on-436-steam-games-as-part-of-epic-games-legal-case.2286140/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HnjzWzGmKKk:uMzF87x4mCg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HnjzWzGmKKk:uMzF87x4mCg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HnjzWzGmKKk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d554836c340c466796ba4c0ac04288d2386989c4ef7fef54720600201c8261b0","category":"Apple"}
