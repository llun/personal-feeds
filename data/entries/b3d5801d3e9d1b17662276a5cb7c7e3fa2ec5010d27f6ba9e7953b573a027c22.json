Fortunately, the 32-year-old Belgian remounted and was able to continue in the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident occurred with around 12 km to go on the day as a reduced peloton was making its way up the San Giacomo finishing climb. Serry was at the very back of the group and slowing down as the BikeExchange car approached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone in the passenger seat of the BikeExchange vehicle appeared to exchange an item with someone in another vehicle, and then, moments later, the BikeExchange car collided with the back of Serry’s bike.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Glad to see he got up from this and continued on. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro104?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giro104</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ftmds8kHqy\">pic.twitter.com/ftmds8kHqy</a></p>\n<p>— CyclingTips (@cyclingtips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclingtips/status/1392855735256580096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>The impact sent Serry to the ground immediately. The BikeExchange driver, sport director Gene Bates, quickly stopped the car behind the Deceuninck-QuickStep rider, who stayed on the ground for a few moments before getting up. BikeExchange staff members got out of the car to check on Serry and then Serry’s own team car arrived at the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serry ultimately got back onto his back and appeared to be okay, which his team confirmed after the stage.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Happy to report that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pieter_Serry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Pieter_Serry</a> is ok and has completed today’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giro</a> stage<br />Thanks to everyone for the well wishes <a href=\"https://t.co/qE5YZxqCmK\">pic.twitter.com/qE5YZxqCmK</a></p>\n<p>— Deceuninck-QuickStep (@deceuninck_qst) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deceuninck_qst/status/1392880415699050501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<p>Bates has since been ejected from the Giro d’Italia, and BikeExchange sport director Matt White received a fine of 2,000 Swiss francs for the incident. The team car will also start stage 7 in the final position in the convoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BikeExchange tweeted after the stage that Bates had spoken to Serry and apologized.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giro</a> </p>\n<p>UPDATE  Our sport director Gene Bates has spoken directly to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pieter_Serry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Pieter_Serry</a> and to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deceuninck_qst?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@deceuninck_qst</a> to apologise personally following the incident on today’s stage 6.</p>\n<p>We’re all happy to see that Pieter was able to finish the stage.</p>\n<p>— Team BikeExchange (@GreenEDGEteam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenEDGEteam/status/1392899120701054976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/team-car-driver-hits-pieter-serry-from-behind/\">Team car driver hits Pieter Serry from behind</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"b3d5801d3e9d1b17662276a5cb7c7e3fa2ec5010d27f6ba9e7953b573a027c22","category":"Cycling"}
