Fortunately, the 32-year-old Belgian remounted and was able to continue in the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incident occurred with around 12 km to go on the day as a reduced peloton was making its way up the San Giacomo finishing climb. Serry was at the very back of the group and slowing down as the BikeExchange car approached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone in the passenger seat of the BikeExchange vehicle appeared to exchange an item with someone in another vehicle, and then, moments later, the BikeExchange car collided with the back of Serryâ€™s bike.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ðŸ˜¬ Glad to see he got up from this and continued on. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giro104?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giro104</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ftmds8kHqy\">pic.twitter.com/ftmds8kHqy</a></p>\n<p>â€” CyclingTips (@cyclingtips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cyclingtips/status/1392855735256580096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>The impact sent Serry to the ground immediately. The BikeExchange driver quickly stopped the car behind the Deceuninck-QuickStep rider, who stayed on the ground for a few moments before getting up. BikeExchange staff members got out of the car to check on Serry and then Serryâ€™s own team car arrived at the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serry ultimately got back onto his back and appeared to be okay, but it was not immediately known if he had suffered any injuries.</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He is back on his bike, but that gave us a huge scare.
