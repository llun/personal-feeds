While the deals don't match the all-time lowest prices we saw around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, they are substantially below the typical street prices we see on Amazon for those in the market for a cheap slate today. The offers include the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3a2TvHW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fire HD 8 for $65</a>, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3jyDa0Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fire HD 10 for $95</a>, and the Kids Edition version of those <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rFooIG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">slates for $90</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rBfPOJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$135</a>, respectively.</p>\n<p>As always, the Fire HD lineup should only be considered by consumers looking for a media consumption device for as cheap as possible. These tablets are neither as well-built nor as speedy as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/ipad-2020-micro-review-battle-tested-and-more-than-fast-enough/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple's entry-level iPad</a>, and they're <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/the-100-tablet-shootout-amazon-fire-8-hd-plus-vs-walmart-onn-8-tablet-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still saddled with</a> Amazon's Fire OS skin, which excludes Google apps and the Play Store altogether (<a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/25/install-play-store-amazon-fire-tablet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">by default, at least</a>). That said, for basic Web browsing, e-book reading, and Netflix viewing, they're more than competent, which is still a victory given how little they'll set you back.</p>\n<p>Besides that, our deals roundup includes discounts on Apple's AirPods Pro, the excellent UE Wonderboom 2 portable speaker, a lap desk we like, tons of video games, and much more.
