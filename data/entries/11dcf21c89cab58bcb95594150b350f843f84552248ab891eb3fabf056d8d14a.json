Read on to find out what enduro is all about, why you might want to give it a go and what you need to get started.</p>\n<h2>What is enduro racing?</h2>\n<p>There’s a clue in the name – it’s gravity racing but with an endurance element. In the early days, ‘enduro’ races were long-distance cross-country races, but those now tend to be known as marathon races.</p>\n<p>Modern enduro events are very different. Enduro races are made up of multiple downhill stages, which are timed to generate the event’s result, while the uphills are ‘liaisons’. Here riders have to reach the start of the next stage within a time limit but, providing a rider meets that time limit, the actual time doesn’t contribute to the final result. Got it?</p>\n<p>Enduro races tend to last one or two days with riders normally completing up to six timed downhill stages per day. The cumulative times of all their stage results are added together to create their overall time, which ultimately decides a rider’s finishing position in the field.</p>\n<p>Whether riders pedal to the top of each downhill stage or jump on a form of uplift transport (whether that’s vans, buses, chairlifts or cable cars) depends heavily on where the event is organised and the amount of elevation change the day’s riding (or a particular stage transition) has.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Drag your heels on the climbs and it won’t matter how rapid you are on the downhills.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish</i></span></div>\n<p>The best-known and biggest enduro event is the Enduro World Series. The EWS visits some of the world’s best riding spots for each of its rounds. Each round has a winner and there’s also a series winner at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Many smaller, local enduro events also exist, and some of these have EWS qualifier status which means if you place high enough, you could enter an EWS event.</p>\n<p>If you fancy a slice of the Enduro World Series action but can’t or don’t want to qualify, there are also EWS 100 and EWS 80 events, which allow non-qualifying riders to race in a separate event but on 100% or 80% of the course.</p>\n<h2>What’s so good about enduro racing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The finish line is in sight – time for the banter to begin!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy McCandlish</i></span></div>\n<p>Downhill racing requires extreme technical skill (and bravery) and expensive kit, while cross-country racing is largely about fitness (although XC race courses are becoming increasingly more technical).</p>\n<p>However, anyone with a decent trail bike, some technical riding experience and enough stamina to ride their local singletrack for a couple of hours can have a bash at enduro.</p>\n<p>You might also find yourself already riding enduro without knowing it. After all, enduro isn’t only about racing, it’s a style of riding in itself.</p>\n<p>Do you pedal efficiently but relatively slowly to the top of descents, where you then ride as hard and as fast as you can downhill, expending the most energy? If so, you’re already an enduro rider!</p>\n<p>Enduro racing is also arguably better value for money than downhill racing. You get a lot more riding for your entrance fee than at a downhill race, because you ride multiple stages rather than just one track. This also means a mishap or mechanical won’t necessarily put you out of the running because it’s the overall time that counts, rather than individual stages.</p>\n<p>The other big thing going for enduro races is the friendly atmosphere. While the top riders are definitely in it to win it, further down the field it’s more about having a go and enjoying a bit of finish line banter.</p>\n<p>The same, of course, could be said for almost any event – mountain bikers are generally a friendly bunch (we would say that!).</p>\n<h2>What type of bike do I need for enduro racing?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We crowned the Trek Slash 8 as our Enduro Bike of the Year for 2021.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To race enduro competitively, you’ll want a full-suspension bike with at least 140mm of travel, and up to 170mm of travel.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing in the rules to stop you using a hardtail mountain bike or lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/top-5-2021-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bike</a> but you’ll find it hard work on the descents. At the other end of the spectrum, longer-travel freeride and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a> are a drag on the climbs.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Enduro bikes are designed to be fully capable downhill, while still being comfortable to pedal uphill.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s a good idea to fit a chain device and clutch-equipped <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> so your chain doesn’t get bucked off on the rocky sections. Big-volume downhill-style <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a> are decent additions, too – they increased puncture resistance and add comfort.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, a short stem and wide handlebar will improve control, and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> will make it easier to throw the bike around when things get sketchy.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Enduro bikes typically have around 140mm to 170mm of travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The growing profile of enduro racing, and the popularity of enduro as a style of riding, means that a lot of mountain bike brands now offer enduro bikes specifically designed and specced for the demands of the discipline.</p>\n<p>Want to know more?

With riders like Richie Rude, Jared Graves and Jesse Melamed in the men’s field and Andreane Lanthier Nadeau, Katy Winton and Miranda Miller in the women’s events, you can be sure racing will be tight.</p>\n<h2>Where can I have a go at enduro racing?</h2>\n<h3>Enduro World Series</h3>\n<p>The 2021 Enduro World Series consists of seven events.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Round</th><th>Location</th><th>Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Round one</td><td>Trentino</td><td>23 June 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Round two</td><td>Trentino</td><td>25 June 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Round three </td><td>La Thuile</td><td>08 July 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Round four </td><td>Loudenvielle</td><td>02 September 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Round five</td><td>Crans-Montana</td><td>11 September 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Round six </td><td>Finale</td><td>18 September 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Round seven</td><td>Tweed Valley</td><td>02 October 2021</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h3>Enduro World Series qualifiers</h3>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Event</th><th>Location</th><th>Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Victorian Enduro Tour Falls Creek (AUS)</td><td>Falls Creek, VIC</td><td>06 February 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Intense Cycles Capital Kamikaze (AUS)</td><td>Mt Stromlo, Canberra</td><td>21 February 2021</td>        </tr><tr><td>Enduro Fest -
