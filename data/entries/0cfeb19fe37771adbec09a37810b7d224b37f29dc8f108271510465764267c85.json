Yumezi can be ridden now, as a guest world, and will be added to Zwift’s regular virtual worlds rotation from 1 June.</p>\n<p>Zwift says the map’s landscape and features are inspired by Japanese culture. Indeed, the map’s name apparently means ‘path to dreams’ in Japanese (yu-meh-zi ᐧ 夢路).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift says Yumezi’s landscape has been inspired by Japanese culture.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The new map contains a variety of roads, from “tight, flat, winding roads ideal for fast races” to gravel trails and cobbled streets.</p>\n<p>With the surrounding landscape containing features like lush green fields, ginkgo forests, mythical creatures, cherry blossom trees, waterfalls and ancient temples, Zwift says it’s the ideal place to try out its recently released ‘<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/zwift-hide-display/\">Hide Display</a>’ feature.</p>\n<h2>Yumezi routes and features</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Yumezi features 53 miles / 85.3km of new roads.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The Yumezi map features eight new routes, across a total of 53 miles / 85.3km of new roads;</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sea to Tree (3.3km/108m elevation)</strong> – A short route featuring a short but challenging climb.</li>\n<li><strong>Kappa Quest (9.1km/140m elevation)</strong> – A scenic route taking in Yumezi’s temples and shrines.</li>\n<li><strong>Chain Chomper (13.6km/184m elevation)</strong> – A longer route with two challenging KOMs/QOMs and a sprint.</li>\n<li><strong>Countryside Tour (15.9km/185m elevation) –</strong> A looped tour of Yumezi’s countryside, from farmlands to mountains.</li>\n<li><strong>Flatland Loop (13km/99m elevation) –</strong> A longer, flat route winding around Yumezi’s countryside.</li>\n<li><strong>Two Village Loop (12.8km/88m elevation)</strong> – A challenging circuit where you explore, as the name suggests, two villages.</li>\n<li><strong>Spirit Forest (8.5km/135m elevation)</strong> – A tour through Yumezi’s forest.
