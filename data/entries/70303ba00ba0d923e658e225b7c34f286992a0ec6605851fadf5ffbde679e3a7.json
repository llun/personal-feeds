The hackers’ ability to chain together multiple exploits that compromised fully patched Windows and Android devices led members of Google’s Project Zero and Threat Analysis Group to call the group “highly sophisticated.”</p>\n<h2>Not over yet</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, Project Zero researcher Maddie Stone said that, in the eight months that followed the February attacks, the same group exploited seven more previously unknown vulnerabilities, which this time also resided in iOS. As was the case in February, the hackers delivered the exploits through watering-hole attacks, which compromise websites frequented by targets of interest and add code that installs malware on visitors’ devices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750760#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1750760&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70303ba00ba0d923e658e225b7c34f286992a0ec6605851fadf5ffbde679e3a7","category":"Tech"}
