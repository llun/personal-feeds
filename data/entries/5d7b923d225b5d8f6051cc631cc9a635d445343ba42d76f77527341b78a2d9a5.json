We can't blame you. If you're still hoping to snag a nice price on a good gadget, though, one side effect of Amazon's manufactured holiday is that it has spawned a number of competing sales from other retailers. Target has kicked off a three-day <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fdeal-days%2F-%2FN-xgolj&amp;subid1=ArsPrimeDayRetailers2021\" target=\"_blank\">\"Deal Days\" sale</a> to directly counter Amazon's event, for instance, while Walmart is advertising its own <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fm%2Fdeals-for-days&amp;subid1=ArsPrimeDayRetailers2021\" target=\"_blank\">\"Deals for Days\" promotion</a>.</p>\n<p>As with Prime Day, most of the offers here aren't particularly notable, but for the ones that <em>are</em>, these sales price-match much of what's available on Amazon's site. So if you'd rather opt out of Amazon's summer cash grab, you don't need to miss out on a discount that has caught your eye.</p>\n<p>To help you out, we've gathered up the best non-Prime-Day deals we can find that are currently going on at Target, Walmart, Best Buy, and other online tech outlets. The offers include good prices on Google's Nest smart home gear and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/new-roku-express-4k-plus-voice-remote-pro-announced/\" target=\"_blank\">new Roku media streamers</a>, a recently launched back-to-school sale from Apple that bundles a pair of AirPods with various Macs and iPads, the lowest price we've tracked on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/#h25\" target=\"_blank\">Sony's excellent WH-1000XM4</a> noise-canceling headphones, a good drop on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/game-pass/\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscriptions, and more.
