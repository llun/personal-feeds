Unfortunately for me, light pollution in my Chicago suburb makes stargazing, watching the Perseid meteor showers, and checking out other cool astronomical phenomena a dicey proposition. Even if we get a clear night, the sky is bright enough that watching the nighttime skies is an exercise in frustration.</p>\n<p>So when I got an email touting the <a href=\"https://shop.unistellaroptics.com/evscope-usappc\">Unistellar eVscope</a> and its ability to cut through light pollution and give a clear view of the heavens no matter where you are, I was intrigued. Even better, I had the ideal test setup: my home in suburban Chicago and my family’s place a few miles outside of Shelbyville, Illinois (about 70 miles from Springfield). I could stargaze from a suburban backyard and the edge of a cornfield to see if the eVscope lived up to the hype.</p>\n<h2>An accumulation of light</h2>\n<p>The eVscope emerged from a Kickstarter campaign launched in late 2017. In an attempt to “give the sky back to all of us,” Unistellar promised a “compact, intelligent, and powerful telescope” that was not only simple to use but could also enable city dwellers to see objects like galaxies and nebulae that couldn’t be seen through traditional telescopes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741999#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1741999&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4750fad0fa0f62435466463b466c401df193870a88ebb00ce1dae6672be120f","category":"Tech"}
