Apple determines the exact value of the traded-in product depending on its condition, such as if it has scratches or dents and functions correctly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll devices, regardless of brand or condition, can be traded in for free to Apple as part of the company's commitment to be environmentally friendly. A wide assortment of devices ranging from Blackberry to HTC phones can also be traded in for an Apple Store gift card.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's trade-in program is meant to serve as an incentive to get users of other smartphone brands to switch to ‌iPhone‌ by offering them discounts on their purchase. Apple recently added the Pixel 4, Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 to its list of eligible Android devices for ‌iPhone‌ credit trade-in. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg/\">LG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/\">Apple trade-in</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/lg-smartphone-trade-in-for-new-iphone/\">Apple Attempts to Incentivize LG Smartphone Users to Switch to iPhone Following LG Handset Business Shutdown</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-attempts-to-incentivize-lg-smartphone-users-to-switch-to-iphone-following-lg-handset-business-shutdown.2302810/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WaECKnuYDV4:VfJF8bJAPDY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=WaECKnuYDV4:VfJF8bJAPDY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/WaECKnuYDV4\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aae21cbbd843b0fe811d0479d429cb49e3aa1facafa0a57c3f712bc7ea82f5e7","category":"Apple"}
