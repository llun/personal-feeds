British Cycling urgently needs to speak with trans members and trans-led organisations on widening participation in order to encourage all people to cycling, as they claim to do.'</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/9513/mauri-vansevenant-and-the-rise-of-the-heavy-metal-cyclist\">Mauri Vansevenant and the rise of the heavy metal cyclist</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9548/tom-pidcock-returns-to-his-roots-with-launch-of-new-yorkshire-sportive\">Tom Pidcock returns to his roots with launch of new Yorkshire sportive</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8870/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-14-ben-tulett-the-next-big-thing-in-british-cycling\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast Episode 14 – Ben Tulett, the next big thing in British cycling</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nWith <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/about/article/20201009-British-Cycling-publishes-Transgender-and-Non-Binary-Participation-policy-0\" target=\"_blank\">the announcement</a> of the first iteration of the policy in October, former pro Philippa York praised the steps being taken but stated that 'the work doesn't end here' and that 'as scientific and social issues involved become better understood the policy will be updated'.</p>\n<p>In response to the letter, a British Cycling spokesperson said:</p>\n<p>'British Cycling is fully committed to embedding equality into all areas of its work to ensure that cycling is a supportive and welcoming place for all. Published in October 2020, our Transgender and Non-binary Participation Policy illustrates the requirements of enabling participation and creating an open and inclusive environment at all levels of the sport.</p>\n<p>'As part of the development of the policy we committed to reviewing it on a regular basis to reflect any relevant changes in legislation and guidance.
