The approach taken by DMT, however, is a little different – and in the best way possible. The DMT KR4 doesn’t just layer a 3D mesh/kit fabric over a traditional upper, but instead combines a thinly backed 3D mesh upper with a knitted central tongue.</p>\n<p>The result is a road cycling shoe that feels more like a fast running shoe, and that – if you hadn’t yet guessed – is a very good thing indeed.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos#9\"><p><span>Image 10 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/dmt_kr4_shoes_16_crop.jpg?itok=0QagKqbm\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 10 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Slipper service</h3>\n<p>Working off a fairly narrow last, the DMT KR4 shoes are a slender fit, which only adds to the sensation of becoming race-ready when you slip them on. And slip them on you do, as there is no fiddly tongue to spend minutes getting to seat comfortably over the top of your foot (I’m looking at you, here, Giro E70…).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dmtcycling.com/en/road/kr4\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the DMT KR4 road shoes now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Instead, the central portion of the shoe’s upper is a stretchy knitted fabric which naturally compresses over the foot for a close, perfect fit. The tightening of the fit is accomplished by way of a single L6 Boa dial – push in and turn clockwise to tighten; pull out to loosen.</p>\n<p>The result, also thanks to a secure heel and externally bolstered heel counter, is a fit with zero pressure points. The fabric mounts for the wire lace system have also held fast throughout testing.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/dmt_kr4_shoes_12_crop.jpg?itok=QmFam15k\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Weighting game</h3>\n<p>Two criticisms are sometimes levelled at Nylon composite-soled shoes: firstly, that they’re generally on the weighty side; secondly, that their soles flex a little too much for their power promotion to be considered immediate.</p>\n<p>Taking the first point, surprisingly these 235g (size 42) DMT KR4 shoes are actually lighter than the higher-end KR1 model worn by WorldTour stars such as <a href=\"/tags/tadej-pogacar\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, such is the simplicity of their construction.</p>\n<p>On the second point, I’ve not worn a pair of Nylon-soled cycling shoes that get the power down like these. And the number of shoes I’ve tested over the years is well into three figures.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos#12\"><p><span>Image 13 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/dmt_kr4_shoes_19_crop.jpg?itok=399wZHxO\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 13 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Summer lovin’</h3>\n<p>Why are these shoes perfect for a British summer? While the soles might be devoid of venting, the sides of the upper are incredibly breathable and let a fair amount of cooling air through to keep your feet comfortable. And with summer comes longer rides…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dmtcycling.com/en/road/kr4\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the DMT KR4 road shoes now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>I’ve covered serious miles in the DMT KR4 shoes, with the longest single outing being around 100km, and there was not one moment when I felt like comfort was hindered for any reason.</p>\n<p>Even when your feet expand in hotter climes, the lightly compressive fit and flexible mesh cause neither restriction nor clamminess.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos#13\"><p><span>Image 14 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/dmt_kr4_shoes_20_crop.jpg?itok=wWCIGeRu\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 14 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/6649/the-tifosi-heroes-of-the-giro\">The Tifosi: Heroes of the Giro</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/8008/colnago-g3-x-review\">Colnago G3-X review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8831/tadej-pogacar-the-man-who-would-be-king\">Tadej Pogacar: The man who would be king</a></div>    </div></div><h3>The sole slip-up</h3>\n<p>There is but one issue I’d take with the DMT KR4 shoes. Beyond the fact that some people might baulk at their price for a pair of shoes that doesn’t feature carbon-fibre on its sole (you’d be wrong to turn your nose up for that reason, by the way), there are no guides on the sole for cleat alignment.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos#1\"><p><span>Image 2 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/dmt_kr4_shoes_7_crop.jpg?itok=haqX5G0z\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 2 of </span>20</p>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Instead, the sole is textured with a carbon-effect weave that mirrors the chainmail-like material of the upper. It’s a tiny niggle, but the usual guides would make life easier when it comes to setting them up on day one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dmtcycling.com/en/road/kr4\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the DMT KR4 road shoes now</strong></em></a> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos\">DMT KR4 shoes photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/marc-abbott\">Marc Abbott</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>26 Apr 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9530%2Fdmt-kr4-shoes-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=DMT%20KR4%20shoes%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9530%2Fdmt-kr4-shoes-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=DMT%20KR4%20shoes%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9530%2Fdmt-kr4-shoes-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=DMT%20KR4%20shoes%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F9530%2Fdmt-kr4-shoes-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/9530/dmt-kr4-shoes-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/04/dmt_kr4_shoes_9_crop.jpg?itok=_kLtcwnH\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/shoes\">Shoes</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2113aacdc4cf4cdeb7579a941c680653f349f7f6f1dfcd52f3bbc237b08b803b","category":"Cycling"}
