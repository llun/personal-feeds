After an inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration arrived on Monday evening, SpaceX checked the last remaining box for its Starship SN11 launch attempt.</p>\n<p>The launch window runs from 7 am local time (12:00 UTC) to 3 pm (20:00 UTC). Although the region is clouded in this morning, SpaceX founder Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1376770871260504064\">said early Tuesday</a> that the company is working toward an 8 am launch (13:00 UTC), and roads are already closed to local traffic.</p>\n<p>It is not clear how much visibility SpaceX will want for today's test flight, and we do anticipate some clearing of skies later this morning. So we'll watch and wait to see what happens with the vehicle and the weather. When SpaceX's official webcast goes live it will be embedded below. In the meantime, local activity can be tracked through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDL-ZMRHYrE\">NASASpaceflight.com's livestream</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752419#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1752419&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c3fede8ef78b8d2bc7a93a452382468afbf596bd44633c1c9718ca1c8815ea8f","category":"Tech"}
