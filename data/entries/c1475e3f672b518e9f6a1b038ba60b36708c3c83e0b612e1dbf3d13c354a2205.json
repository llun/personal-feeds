There have now been a sufficiently large number of reports from reliable sources about Apple's plans for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over the next few years, allowing us to build a provisional idea of what may be in store.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"2022:_iphone_14_and_iphone_se_3\">2022: iPhone 14 and iPhone SE 3?</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2022, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will celebrate its fifteenth anniversary. It will mark five years since the first \"all-screen\" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design, which premiered with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X in 2017. Currently, the tentatively titled \"&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14\" is expected to feature:\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Hole-punch front-facing camera design, replacing the notch.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Snapdragon X65 10 Gigabit 5G modem and antenna system.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>A16 chip, manufactured using a 4nm fabrication process.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Vapor chamber thermal sytem for improved cooling.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Unibody lens design for flatter rear camera bump.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Upgraded telephoto camera.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Upgraded ultra wide cameras expanded to all models.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n2022 is also expected to see the release of a third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> model, which would be two years after the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/15/iphone-se-2020/\">launch of the current model</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"android-style_hole-punch_camera_design\">Android-Style Hole-Punch Camera Design</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2022, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">is expected</a> to make some substantial design changes to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Most strikingly, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro models will allegedly see their notch replaced with a punch-hole design, as seen on a number of premium <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/22/huawei-honor-view-20-hole-punch-cutout/\">Android devices</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile the change is expected for the high-end 2022 iPhones, if manufacturing yields are sufficient, the lower-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 models could also feature the same design.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/iPhone-Hole-Punch-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1127\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786864\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has applied for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/future-apple-watch-could-gain-touch-id-and-camera/\">a number of patents</a> related to under-display Face ID technologies, but the company could also conceivably push some Face ID components and the front-facing speaker into the top bezel.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nBarclays analysts <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/iphone-13-touch-id-under-display/\">believe</a> that a smaller notch on &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; models will be the result of a \"more tightly integrated version of the current structured light system\" for Face ID, adding that a \"bigger shift\" is likely to come in 2022, with Apple apparently aiming to adopt time-of-flight architecture for Face ID that would allow for an \"even smaller footprint.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"the_worlds_first_10_gigabit_5g_modem_and_antenna\">The World's First 10 Gigabit 5G Modem and Antenna</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn February 2021, Qualcomm introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/qualcomm-snapdragon-x65/\">the Snapdragon X65</a>, which is the world's first 10 Gigabit 5G modem and antenna system for smartphones. While the X65 is not expected to be used for the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; in 2021, it is expected to be added to Apple's 2022 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/qualcomm-snapdragon-x65-10-gigabit-5g.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"873\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782252\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"4nm_a16_chip\">4nm A16 Chip</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/tsmc-apple-5nm-plus-4nm-chips/\">TrendForce believes</a> it is highly likely that the A16 chip in 2022 iPhones will be manufactured based on TSMC's upcoming <a href=\"https://www.tsmc.com/uploadfile/pr/newspdf/PGHIISPGTH/NEWS_FILE_EN.pdf\">4nm process</a>, paving the way for further improvements to performance, power efficiency, and density.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tsmc_semiconductor_chip_inspection_678x452.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"678\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-756102\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"flatter_rear_camera_bump\">Flatter Rear Camera Bump</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nâ€ŒThe 2022 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models are said to be adopting a new \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/periscope-telephoto-lens-2023-iphones/\">unibody lens design</a>,\" which Apple will use to reduce the thickness of the rear camera module.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"redesigned_cooling_system\">Redesigned Cooling System</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nStarting in 2022, high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/\">likely to adopt</a> a vapor chamber thermal system, providing it meets Apple's requirements for reliability. The system is said to be currently undergoing aggressive testing.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe VC thermal system will be purportedly be required for the high-end iPhones to enable better performance and faster 5G connection speeds. There are already smartphones from companies like Samsung, Razer, and LG that use vapor chamber cooling technology to keep devices at a lower temperature when under heavy strain.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"telephoto_and_ultra_wide_camera_upgrades\">Telephoto and Ultra Wide Camera Upgrades</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nAll 2022 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models are currently expected to see significant camera upgrades. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro models could feature camera improvements that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/periscope-telephoto-lens-2023-iphones/\">focus on the telephoto lens</a>, with Apple upgrading from a 6-element lens to a 7-element lens.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/iphone-12-pro-triple-camera-video.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"895\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-773570\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2021, the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; Pro models are expected to get <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/06/kuo-iphone-13-same-sizes-better-ultrawide-camera/\">significantly upgraded</a> Ultra Wide cameras, increasing from f/2.4 to f/1.8 and from a five-element lens to a six-element lens, also gaining autofocus instead of the current fixed focus. In 2022, these upgrades to the Ultra Wide camera are expected to trickle down to the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 lineup instead of being reserved for the Pro models.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"third-generation_iphone_se\">Third-Generation iPhone SE</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/02/iphone-13-lineup-rumored-120hz-iphone-se-3-2022/\">Various analysts</a> have said that a third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will arrive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/\">in the first half of 2022</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/iphone-se-3-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-771094\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThere is some uncertainty around whether the device will keep its current design with a 4.7-inch display or mirror the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/\">iPhone 11</a> with a 6.1-inch display, but it is expected to retain the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> fingerprint scanner and LCD display technology. Upgrades are likely to include sub-6GHz 5G and a newer A-series processor. There is also the chance of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; adopting the &zwnj;iPhone 11&zwnj;'s dual camera system with an added Ultra Wide lens.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2 id=\"2023:_iphone_15_and_foldable_iphone\">2023: iPhone 15 and Foldable iPhone?</h2>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2023, it will be ten years since the launch of the popular &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5s, and five years since Apple revealed the first large full-screen &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS Max. 2023's presumably-titled \"&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15\" is currently rumored to feature:\r\n<br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>A true full-screen design with no notch or hole-punch.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Under-display &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; fingerprint scanner.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Periscopic telephoto camera.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>A17 chip, manufactured using a 3nm fabrication process.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n<li>Apple-designed 5G modem.</li>\r\n<br/>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRumors have also indicated that a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model with a clamshell folding design may debut in 2023. Keep in mind that the 2023 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; rumors are still years off, and what we're hearing now in terms of rumors may not actually materialize.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"the_first_truly_full-screen_iphone\">The First Truly Full-Screen iPhone</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nA minimum of one high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model in 2023 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">expected</a> to feature the first true full-screen design with no notch or hole punch. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nPresumably, if the hole-punch front-facing camera design is not <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">rolled out</a> to all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models in 2022, being kept for Pro models only, then in 2023 the design will reach the lower-end models too.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"under-display_touch_id\">Under-Display Touch ID</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is believed to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/\">planning to implement</a> a fingerprint scanner under the display of at least one high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2023.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/iPhone-12-Touch-ID-Feature-Img.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781109\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"periscope_camera\">Periscope Camera</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2023, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/periscope-telephoto-lens-2023-iphones/\">expected to adopt</a> a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/30/apple-moving-forward-with-periscope-cameras/\">periscopic telephoto lens</a>\" for the first time. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/periscope-lens/\">Periscope technology</a> would allow for significantly increased optical zoom on iPhones, well beyond the current 2x and 2.5x limits on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>, respectively. Huawei's P40 Pro+ smartphone, for example, features a periscope lens with up to 10x optical zoom.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Huawei-P30-Pro-periscope-camera-cross-section-920x485.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"920\" height=\"485\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788363\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has allegedly run into trouble developing its own periscope camera system because much of the technology is guarded by other patents, and thus Apple is instead <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/07/2022-iphones-periscope-lens-samsung/\">exploring purchasing</a> the components from the patent holders instead. Samsung, for example, owns the \"ball-type actuator\" technology used in many periscope lenses. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<h3 id=\"3nm_a17_chip\">3nm A17 Chip</h3>\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has committed to order chips fabricated using TSMC's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/tsmc-3nm-chip-volume-production-2022/\">3nm process</a>, which will be used for the A17 chip.
