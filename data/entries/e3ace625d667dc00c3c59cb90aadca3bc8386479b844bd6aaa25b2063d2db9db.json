Just as was the case back in 2018 when he hit the line less than a second behind Vincenzo Nibali, Ewan won the sprint for runner-up honors less than a second behind Jasper Stuyven in the 2021 edition of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understandably, coming oh-so-close yet again left Ewan with mixed feelings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That confirmed that I could potentially win the race one day,&#8221; The 26-year-old Australian said after the race. &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty disappointed this time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first Monument of the season came down to a nail-biting finale as several big names went over the top of the Poggio together. Pre-race favorites like Wout van Aert, Julian Alaphillippe, and Mathieu van der Poel were all there, but so too was Ewan, having handled the final climb with aplomb. With 3 km still to go, no one had managed to dislodge the fast-finishing Ewan from the selection, a sign of preparation paying off for Ewan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I knew coming into the race that I was in good form. Like most years, I target this race, and this year I&#8217;ve really tried to improve my climbing and I&#8217;ve even practiced that exact attack on the Poggio many times before this race and that&#8217;s why I knew that in the end, the attacks, if they went there, I should be able to follow,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;I was in really good position on the most part of the Poggio, and when they went, I was obviously suffering a bit but I still had enough left to follow them and I was actually quite comfortable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the lead group rolled into the last kew kilometers with such a quality sprinter in the mix, however, there was not much interest from the rest of the group in helping Ewan keep things under control. Bora-Hansgrohe, Bahrain Victorious, and the Ineos Grenadiers did have two riders each in the group, but Lotto-Soudal did not. When Stuyven made a powerful attack with around 2 km to go, he was able to find some breathing room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chasers kept the Belgian in their sights and Soren Kragh Andersen even bridged up to him at least temporarily, but Stuyven held on to take the win, with Ewan&#8217;s furious sprint only good enough for second place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked afterward whether a teammate or two might have been helpful, Ewan acknowledged that a bit of extra firepower could have made a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For sure. It would have been nice to have one guy there to keep it together because if that group&#8217;s together, then usually I&#8217;m the fastest guy there,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s always a lottery in that situation because there&#8217;s always going to be attacks. And you have to wait. I can&#8217;t just go to the front and bring every break back. I have to take the risk. I took the risk, I did what I thought I needed to do to win and in the end we waited too long.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should the Via Roma see a sprint decide Milan-San Remo at some point in the future, Ewan has certainly proven himself a worthy contender. This time, however, a race often considered the best Classic for the sprinters saw one of the fastest in the world come up just short once again.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/ewan-after-san-remo-that-confirmed-that-i-could-potentially-win-the-race-one-day/\">Ewan after San Remo: &#8216;That confirmed that I could potentially win the race one day&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"e3ace625d667dc00c3c59cb90aadca3bc8386479b844bd6aaa25b2063d2db9db","category":"Cycling"}
