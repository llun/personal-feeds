Stores in Texas, including those in Houston, and Dallas, were the last to reopen after winter storms that affected the area.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/apple-retail-stores-us-all-reopened/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, there are still restrictions at many of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a> in the U.S. Some are offering in-store shopping appointments, while others are only set up for Express pickup of online orders and Genius Support appointments.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple uses local health and safety guidelines to dictate which stores operate, so there is still a chance that there could be additional shutdowns going forward should there be a change in a particular state.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOutside of the U.S., there are still stores closed in France and Brazil.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/apple-reopens-all-us-retail-stores/\">Apple Reopens All 270 Retail Stores in the United States</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reopens-all-270-retail-stores-in-the-united-states.2286671/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ij-B-dXrJVQ:g-aI4QGnSX0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ij-B-dXrJVQ:g-aI4QGnSX0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ij-B-dXrJVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce75ede5e2110970f594dc190b6966799586216e1ec26727784e13a9aee4389d","category":"Apple"}
