{"title":"Buttondown: Newsletter Service That Allows Opting Out of Tracking","link":"https://buttondown.email/","date":1614360331000,"content":"\n<p>It’s hard to find newsletter services that even allow you — the purveyor of the newsletter — <em>not</em> to track your subscribers. Buttondown — from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinmduke\">Justin Duke</a> — is one option, and it looks pretty sweet. (Markdown editing, for example.) From <a href=\"https://buttondown.email/features/privacy\">Buttondown’s privacy feature page</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many busineses thrive the concept of collecting data about\nindividuals based on their email addresses and inbox usage. (You\ncan read about that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html\">here</a>.) Buttondown is different. As a\nbootstrapped business, I don’t need to engage with data on level.\nYour information is yours, and yours alone.</p>\n\n<p>Buttondown collects the standard bevy of email analytics: IP\naddresses, open and click events, client information. Buttondown\nsends that to <em>absolutely nobody</em> besides, well, you, the beloved\ncustomer. And if you want to completely opt out, you can.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By default, Buttondown seems just as privacy-intrusive as all the other newsletter providers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Track Opens and Clicks — Per-email analytics mean you get an easy\nfunnel of how many folks are engaging with your emails and what\ncontent they’re interested in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translated to plain English: “<em>Spy tracking allows you to know when each of your subscribers opens and reads your newsletter, including the ability to creep on them individually.</em>” Buttondown’s privacy “win” is that it at least <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pascallaliberte/status/1365372547311800322\">allows you to turn tracking off with a simple checkbox</a>. Most services don’t. I can’t find any hosted service that doesn’t offer tracking period, or even defaults to no tracking.</p>\n\n<p>One message I’ve heard from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">folks</a> <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter\">who</a> would <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/\">know</a> is that two of the reasons for the ubiquitous use of tracking pixels in newsletters are anti-spam tools (<em>anti</em>-anti-spam tools, really) and the expense of sending emails to people who never read them. Newsletters being flagged as spam — especially by major players like Gmail and Hotmail — is a never-ending game of whack-a-mole, and spy pixels help alert newsletter providers that their messages are being flagged. Expense-wise, those who send free newsletters want to cull from their lists people who never open them or click any of the links. Sending newsletters to thousands (let alone tens of thousands or more) of subscribers is, relatively speaking, expensive.</p>\n\n<p>I’m sympathetic, but that’s a <a href=\"https://quotegeek.com/quotes-from-movies/boogie-nights/1125/\">YP, not an MP</a>, so fuck you and your tracking pixels. I’m blocking them and you should too.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s why the world needs a company like Apple to take action. If Apple were to kneecap email tracking in Mail for Mac and iOS, the industry would have to adapt.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Buttondown: Newsletter Service That Allows Opting Out of Tracking’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/26/buttondown\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f2045bbdbbc55410c41cc3ea433f656da6f1278cb1f4c23a5bf028a4372513bb","category":"Tech"}
