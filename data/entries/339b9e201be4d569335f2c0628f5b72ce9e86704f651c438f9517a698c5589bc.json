The first three episodes of the series will premiere globally on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> on November 12, and the remaining episodes will be released weekly every Friday, according to <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/06/will-ferrell-and-paul-rudd-star-in-highly-anticipated-apple-original-limited-series-the-shrink-next-door-premiering-globally-friday-november-12-on-apple-tv/\">Apple's announcement</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the podcast of the same name by Wondery and Bloomberg Media, Apple says \"The Shrink Next Door\" is a dark comedy inspired by true events surrounding the bizarre relationship between psychiatrist Dr. Isaac \"Ike\" Herschkopf, played by Rudd, and his longtime patient Martin \"Marty\" Markowitz, played by Ferrell.<blockquote>Over the course of their relationship, the all-too-charming Ike slowly inserts himself into Marty's life, even moving into Marty's Hamptons home and persuading Marty to name him president of the family business. The series explores how a seemingly normal doctor-patient dynamic morphs into an exploitative relationship filled with manipulation, power grabs, and dysfunction at its finest.</blockquote>The project will bring Ferrell and Rudd on screen together for the first time since \"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" in 2013.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn other ‌Apple TV+‌ news, Apple has also shared a teaser trailer for season two of \"Truth Be Told,\" an anthology drama series starring Octavia Spencer.
