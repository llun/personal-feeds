Kali’s answer is to use a special gel-like low-density layer from specialist firm <a href=\"https://rheonlabs.com/rheon-technology-how-it-works/\" target=\"_blank\">Rheon</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet is also constructed with the company’s Conehead nano core concept that aims to provide specific crush zones within the EPS foam. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such safety aspects show on the scales – the new Grit is claimed to weigh a slightly portly 314 g. The helmet passes EN 1078, CPSC, and AS/NZS 2063-2008 standards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grit features Kali’s new “Frequency Fit System” which provides a three-position vertical adjustment in addition to the regular dial-based circumferential sizing. The straps feature fixed intersections which are said to stay flat to the face and prevent twisting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grit is available now in two sizes (55-61 cm and 60-63 cm) but there’s only one colourway: a two-tone black design. We’re yet to try this new helmet ourselves, but you can find more information at <a href=\"https://kaliprotectives.com/products/the-grit?variant=32308860158046\" target=\"_blank\">Kaliprotectives.com</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kali-Grit-road-helmet-1-1340x754.jpg\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/kali-protectives-introduces-the-grit-road-helmet/\">Kali Protectives introduces the Grit, a premium safety-focussed road helmet</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"191690e22773a80c949da2358431f9f4c3c3c66b1519dd16b2f2ba1a0c55f280","category":"Cycling"}
