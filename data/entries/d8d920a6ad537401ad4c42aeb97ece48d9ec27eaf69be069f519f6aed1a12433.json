Audacity is free and open source, relatively easy to use, cross platform, and ideally suited for simple \"prosumer\" tasks like editing raw audio into finished podcasts.</p>\n<p>However, the negativity seems to be both massively overblown and quite late. While the team has announced that Audacity will begin collecting telemetry, it's neither overly broad in scope nor aggressive in how it acquires the data—and the majority of the real concerns were addressed two months ago, to the apparent satisfaction of the actual Audacity community.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778350#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1778350&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8d920a6ad537401ad4c42aeb97ece48d9ec27eaf69be069f519f6aed1a12433","category":"Tech"}
