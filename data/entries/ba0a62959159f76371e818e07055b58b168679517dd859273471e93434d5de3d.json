Asian Americans have not had it easy in this country, especially last year with the pandemic blame of 2020 being so rampant. Hate crimes leave this country feeling shocked, angry, and helpless. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in our country and today, we&#8217;d like to extend a hand in support for the Asian American community. We will continue to dream about an America without such heinous acts.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ba0a62959159f76371e818e07055b58b168679517dd859273471e93434d5de3d","category":"Cycling"}
