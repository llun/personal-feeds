In fact, this is the first-ever official bicycle of the Tour de France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In homage to Le Grande Boucle’s history, the bike features yellow decals, fork legs, and brake levers, à la the Tour’s iconic leader’s jersey. Colnago is offering just 108 of these V3Rs TDF bikes – one for every year of the Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the bike is <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2019/07/colnago-v3rs-an-all-round-racer-thats-amusingly-on-trend-for-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago’s V3Rs frame</a> as ridden to victory in last year’s Tour. The V3Rs is Colnago’s do-it-all, lightweight, aero offering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago designers collaborated with Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO, organisers of the TdF) to create this unique livery with contrasting black and bright yellow. The iconic yellow is a natural choice, and Colnago has made sure it takes pride of place, even going so far as repainting that right-hand brake lever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colnago clubs-and-rainbow-bands logo adorns the head tube. The Tour de France logo joins the famous Italian brand’s, making an appearance on the fork legs and the top tube. That top tube logo is accompanied by each bike’s number in the limited run of 108. Finally, an outline of France with the text “V3Rs 2020 TDF edition’s winner” sits at the intersection between the seatstays and the seat post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colnago has turned to fellow Italian manufacturers Campagnolo for its Super Record EPS Disc groupset, Bora for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/04/campagnolo-debuts-new-bora-ultra-wto-flagship-aero-road-racing-wheels/\">new Ultra WTO</a> wheels, and Deda Elementi for its Alanera integrated handlebar and stem. Selle Italia supplies the SLR Boost saddle, meaning the Continental GP5000 tyres are the only non-Italian marque on the whole bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its long history and association with some of the top names in the professional sport, Tadej Pogacar’s victory last year was the first overall win for Colnago at the Tour de France. If this bike is a reaction to that win, one hopes we don’t have to wait as long for the next Colnago victory at Le Grande Boucle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colnago V3Rs TDF is available if you are lucky enough to get one of the 108 and are happy to part with US$16,399 / £11,090 / AU$20,340 / €13,200. That’s almost a bargain when compared to the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/nft-of-colnago-c64-sells-for-2300-more-than-actual-colnago-c64/\" target=\"_blank\">US$8,500 paid for a Colnago non-bike bike image</a> last week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find more information at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.colnago.com/en/tdf/\">Colnago.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colnago-V3Rs-TDF-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Is it too soon to write a letter to Santa? </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Colnago-V3Rs-TDF-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>That yellow brake lever really stands out.
