(Duh.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Then we look at all the folks you’re following on Twitter.</p></li>\n<li><p>We check every couple minutes to see if they’ve changed their\nprofile information.</p></li>\n<li><p>If they have, we record it!</p></li>\n<li><p>Then, every morning (or every week), we send you an email with\nall the changes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Daily was too much for me, perhaps because I follow too many accounts on Twitter, but once a week is perfect. And you can subscribe via RSS instead of email — this is a very natural service for RSS.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Spoonbill’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/02/26/spoonbill\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c03523a0f03af77b71a03ad88c9d250e8fdb8392b1e9900ed9ee460f7f3b7eaa","category":"Tech"}
