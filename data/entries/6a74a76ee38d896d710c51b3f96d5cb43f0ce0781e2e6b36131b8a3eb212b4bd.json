But optics are still important, and electric racing cars aren't really suitable for use in endurance racing or Formula 1, so the industry is looking at lower-carbon (or even carbon-neutral) fuels as a way to keep using internal combustion engines.</p>\n<p>Formula 1 has announced its plan to become carbon-neutral by 2030, <a href=\"https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/biofuel-barrels-arrive-as-f1-tests-zero-carbon-fuel\">and sustainable fuels are going to be part of that</a>, but they're not the only game in town. On Tuesday, Porsche revealed that the 2021 and 2022 seasons of Porsche Supercup—a race series for identical Porsche 911 racing cars—will be powered by Esso renewable racing fuel, \"a blend of primarily advanced biofuels,\" according to the press release.</p>\n<p>But this biofuel blend is just the first version of Esso's renewable racing fuel. Starting next year, Porsche will start testing the second generation Esso renewable fuel. And that one will incorporate synthetic fuel, made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide at a plant in Chile that Porsche is developing with Siemens. By 2022, Porsche and Siemens are targeting 34,000 gallons (130,000 L) of synthetic fuel production, increasing to 14.5 million gallons (55 million L) by 2024 and 145 million gallons (550 million L) by 2026.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753128#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1753128&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
