It is not clear, however, if LG Display will supply Apple with this display panel for mass production once it has been developed.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSamsung <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/\">has been rumored</a> to be Apple's supplier of choice for an OLED foldable display and the company was said to have provided Apple with a large number of foldable display samples for testing last year, so it is unclear how the news of a collaboration with LG fits into this. Apple has used both LG and Samsung OLED displays for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date, and it is possible that the display for the long-rumored foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; may be provided by both suppliers.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nYesterday, it was reported that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/7-inch-foldable-iphone-with-apple-pencil-2023/\">planning to launch</a> a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a 7-inch OLED display and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> support as soon as 2023. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">researching foldable devices</a> since 2016, but rumors surrounding a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; have noticeably increased in recent months, suggesting that the device may be gathering momentum behind the scenes.<div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">digitimes.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/17/lg-apple-foldable-displays/\">LG Reportedly Assisting Apple on Foldable Display Development</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-reportedly-assisting-apple-on-foldable-display-development.2285088/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fLz0e7abUD4:8y7AfyA7na0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=fLz0e7abUD4:8y7AfyA7na0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/fLz0e7abUD4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8743738ae3d4ae9b95eddcafabe27558476c94b4060d3d7cbf8e27157c53fb3e","category":"Apple"}
