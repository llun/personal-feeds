It's integrated into all of Facebook's apps, including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. At launch, Facebook Pay had already supported person-to-person payments via Messenger and the Facebook app, and now the social media giant is now hoping to target physical person-to-person payments.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs first discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href=\"https://thetapedrive.com/pages/about\">Steve Moser</a>, users will be prompted with a new \"Scan\" button in their Facebook Pay carousel. Pressing it allows users to scan a QR code for a friend or family member, select the amount, and transfer the money. Additionally, Facebook Pay is also introducing personalized payment links, which automatically direct others to a secure page to transfer money to your account.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nScott Harkey, chief strategy officer and head of financial services and payments at <a href=\"https://www.levvel.io/about\">Levvel</a> and who worked with Apple for its expansion of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a>, tells <em>MacRumors</em> that despite Facebook's intention, it has work to do around changing people's perception that Facebook Pay is, and can be, a mainstream way to pay.<blockquote>At the end of the day, payment methods have to solve a problem and be easier or more beneficial than existing methods.  If someone does a lot of buying on Facebook Marketplace or buys a lot of things from Facebook adds, then you can see how a stored credential and in-app payment mechanism would be the most convenient.  However, it’s not clear to me why someone would use Facebook QR code for P2P in person. I don’t believe many people currently think of Facebook as a way to transact or transfer money, and Facebook would need to change that perception in order for them to have any meaningful traction in the US.</blockquote>Facebook Pay continues to expand globally, and a list of where and on which Facebook-owned apps the service is available can be found <a href=\"https://pay.facebook.com/availability/\">on its website</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/05/facebook-pay-qr-code-payments/\">Facebook Pay Introduces Personalized QR Codes for Person-to-Person Payments</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-pay-introduces-personalized-qr-codes-for-person-to-person-payments.2290668/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JL5QHBz1yXQ:6w3mRvAalcc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JL5QHBz1yXQ:6w3mRvAalcc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JL5QHBz1yXQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9c1e7bcac7116aa1c3e767d3550e15fd05adf682f157c7fc229e24e2080b9492","category":"Apple"}
