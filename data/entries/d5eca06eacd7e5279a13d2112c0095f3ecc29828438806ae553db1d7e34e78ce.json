Check out the pictures and video embedded below.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/conceptsiphone-imac-20211.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-redesigned-imacs-slimmer-bezels/\">Bloomberg</a></em>, Apple's redesigned ‌iMac‌ models will feature slimmed down bezels around the display and the metal chin will be removed. The new look is expected to be quite similar to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Pro Display XDR monitor</a> that Apple released in 2019, and that's what we see here. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of a curved rear design, the iMacs will feature a flat back, and prior rumors have described the new iMacs as using an \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> design language.\" At least one of the new models that will replace the 21.5 and 27-inch models will measure in at 23 to 24 inches, but it's not clear what size the second ‌iMac‌ will be. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSerial leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/03/imac-big-display-leak/\">L0vetodream</a> has said that at least one of the new ‌iMac‌ models will feature a display that is much larger than the current 27-inch model, presumably due to reduced bezels.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/conceptsiphone-imac-20212.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/24/prosser-imac-colors-mac-pro-to-resemble-mac-minis/\">suggested</a> that the 2021 ‌iMac‌ models will come in five colors that match the colors of the fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> (Silver, Space Gray, Green, Sky Blue, and Rose Gold). This rumor has since been hinted at by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/17/leaker-new-imacs-apple-spring-event/\">L0vetodream</a>, who suggested that the colorful new iMacs may be launched at Apple's \"Spring Loaded\" event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has developed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/face-id-imac-second-version-of-redesign/\">underlying Mac support for Face ID</a>, Apple's facial recognition technology. Apple initially planned to include it in the ‌iMac‌ refresh coming in 2021, but according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, it has been delayed and is not likely to be included in the first iteration of the new ‌iMac‌ lineup.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/conceptsiphone-imac-20213.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also expected equip the new iMacs with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/07/apple-silicon-macbook-pro-imac-pro-2021/\">next-generation versions</a> of its Apple silicon chips. Not only will be faster and offer more GPU power, better efficiency, cooler running chips, and tighter mainboard integration could allow for a thinner chassis. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nReferences to two unreleased ‌iMac‌ models has been found in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> 11.3 beta code, identified as \"iMac21,1\" and \"iMac21,2.\" Could they reference new models that take cues from Apple's first-generation ‌iMac‌ by coming in different colors? We may know for sure before the day is out.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-event-april-2021/\">How to Watch the 'Spring Loaded' Apple Event on April 20, 2021</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nApple will hold its first media event of 2021 later on Tuesday, April 20, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time through a live stream.
