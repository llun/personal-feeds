Renders were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/10/leaked-renders-for-third-gen-airpods/\">shared yesterday</a>, and today, <em><a href=\"https://www.52audio.com/archives/74422.html\">52audio</a></em> has published a series of images said to feature the third-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1157\" height=\"651\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788642\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nAs with prior leaks, the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 have an &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; Pro-like design with a shorter stem and a more rounded body design that's close to identical to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>. The stem will still be a bit longer than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; stem, but it's much shorter than the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; stem.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"898\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788643\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nRumors have suggested the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 will have snap-in silicone ear pieces for a more comfortable and customizable in-ear fit, much like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, but that doesn't appear to be the design depicted in the images. If accurate, these images suggest the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 will have a design similar to the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; without silicone tips.\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"891\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788644\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nThe &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 case will be similar in design to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; case. It's wider than the standard &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; case to accommodate the new body design, and not as tall because it no longer needs to fit such long stems. It does not appear to have room in the top for silicone ear tips, which also suggests a tipless design.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1198\" height=\"957\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788645\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nWhile the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 will look like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, rumors suggest they will not have Pro-level features. Active Noise Cancellation will remain limited to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, and other features like spatial audio may also be a premium feature.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 are expected to continue to feature an Apple H1 chip and all of the standard functionality currently available to the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2 and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; like fast device pairing, pressure relief functionality, quick switching, clear call quality enabled through beam-forming microphones, and long range.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/airpods-3-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788646\" />\r\n<br/>\r\n<em>52audio</em> believes that the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 will be priced at &#36;150. &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2 sell for &#36;159 without a Wireless Charging Case and &#36;199 with a Wireless Charging Case. It's not clear if Apple will offer both options with the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3, but it seems likely Qi-based wireless charging functionality will be the standard option.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n&zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 are believed to be ready to go, and they're expected to launch early in 2021. In fact, rumors suggest that Apple could hold an event <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/\">on March 23</a>, and if that happens, it's likely that event will see the debut of the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">Upcoming AirPods 3 Redesign Shown Off in New Images</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-airpods-3-redesign-shown-off-in-new-images.2288124/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QXOmpQTIBWE:gsJmCNNAGP0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QXOmpQTIBWE:gsJmCNNAGP0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QXOmpQTIBWE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"962a3fea8b4e2fd990c6633e30132d97261e024951993282bb2b4936b3cfc448","category":"Apple"}
