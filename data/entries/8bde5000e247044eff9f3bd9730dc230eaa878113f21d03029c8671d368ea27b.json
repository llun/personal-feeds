Thinner and lighter than the Air with a 12-inch retina display and a sole USB-C port, it seemed to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/225278/review-the-new-12-inch-macbook-is-a-laptop-without-an-ecosystem.html\">usher in a new era for Apple’s laptops</a>. But the price tag and processor held it back, and the keyboard ended up being one of the most reviled in Apple’s history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less than four years later, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233004/apple-kills-macbook-non-touch-bar-macbook-pro-notebook-shakeup.html\">Apple discontinued the MacBook line</a> after just two revisions. Now Apple has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624#ipadvintage&amp;xcust=1-1-350115-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">officially designated the 2015 MacBook as “vintage,”</a> meaning Apple “Apple stopped distributing them for sale more than 5 and less than 7 years ago.” It’s the first Mac from 2015 that has been declared vintage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple added a new product to the “vintage” doesn’t usually mean much, but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346119/2021-macbook-air-specs-colors-design-ports-magsafe-ram-apple-silicon-price-release.html\">in light of recent rumors</a>, it could be significant. Apple is rumored to be working on a new MacBook with an Apple silicon that could come in colors similar to the iMac. According to several rumors, the machine will have a 13-inch display, MagSafe, and a faster processor than the M1. It was originally rumored to arrive later this year, but it’s possible that the release gets pushed to 2022 due to industry-wide supply constraints.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8bde5000e247044eff9f3bd9730dc230eaa878113f21d03029c8671d368ea27b","category":"Apple"}
