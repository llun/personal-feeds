Well, you could win this fully decked out, dream <a href=\"https://www.santacruzbicycles.com/en-US/bikes/hightower\" target=\"_blank\">Hightower</a> build from Santa Cruz Bicycles by partaking in the <a href=\"https://sierratrails.org/5bucks/\" target=\"_blank\">Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship’s $5 a Foot fundraiser</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship’s 5 Bucks a Foot fundraiser is back with a customized, Santa Cruz Hightower up for grabs! Sure, there’s a bike shortage, and yes, it’s nearly impossible just to get some bike parts these days. Yet, we got lucky enough to assemble this bling’ed masterpiece: a one-of-a-kind Hightower (size Large) decked out with parts you can’t even get your hands on these days. And if you want to come pick it up in-person*, you can receive complimentary lodging at The Lure Resort in Downieville, CA for the weekend. Come out and ride the Downieville Downhill on your brand-new bike!</p>\n<p>We are building a legacy trail – the 300+ mile Lost Sierra Route – through our Connected Communities Project. The building and maintenance of “A Trail for Everyone” will employ local residents and help our small businesses thrive. For every $5 you donate to 5 Bucks a Foot between Tuesday, June 8 to Friday, July 9, 2021, you can directly contribute to this project and possibly win this sweet ride.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hop on over to <a href=\"https://sierratrails.org/5bucks/\" target=\"_blank\">Sierra Trails</a> to enter to win and help out the <a href=\"https://sierratrails.org/connected-communities/\" target=\"_blank\">Connected Communities initiative</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"5f95afda52561e5732508e9c48c2d0009681bd5890e97c65bd8e6acc76aef502","category":"Cycling"}
