However, the hallmark of its bikes was – and remains – the carefully thought-out specification.</p>\n<p>All the contact points such as handlebars, grips, brake levers and saddle are proportioned to match the age and size of the rider. The level of detail also includes giving consideration to the length of the cranks, so that even children with very short legs feel comfortable on the bike.</p>\n<p>After many years focussing on junior riders, Islabikes has turned its attention to older riders but stuck with the idea that not only should the frame size suit the rider, the ancillaries should be proportional too. Now the next step in the Islabikes evolution is the introduction of electric bicycles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.islabikes.co.uk/products/adult-electric-bike-ejanis\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Islabikes eJanis e-bike now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>Currently, Islabikes has two e-bikes, the off-road eJimi and the urban eJanis. In another move setting it apart from other bicycle manufacturers, Islabikes doesn’t make men’s bikes or women’s bikes – rather it simply has low-frame unisex models. The design makes it easy to get on and off the bike, with no need to swing a leg over the saddle.</p>\n<p>On the eJanis, that frame is made from aluminium and paired with a carbon fibre fork. The oversized down tube of the frame is put to good use providing an inconspicuous home for the Panasonic battery that is used to power the 250W Mahle Ebikemotion X35 electric motor. Housed inside the rear wheel hub, it is as discreet as the battery.</p>\n<p>To ensure that you won’t be entirely reliant on the electric assistance, Islabikes has equipped the eJanis with a wide-ranging 11-40T, 10-speed cassette at the rear wheel. The rest of the wheel package includes Sram DB Level TL hydraulic disc brakes with 160mm rotors, aluminium 700c rims and Islabikes’ own 30c large-volume tyres, which include puncture protection and reflective sidewalls.</p>\n<p>The bike’s finishing kit reflects the company’s belief that the bike should fit the rider and, as such, the crank length is proportional to the frame size. On the smallest 14in frame that means 160mm cranks, whereas the 20in model pushes the crank length to 175mm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.islabikes.co.uk/products/adult-electric-bike-ejanis\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Islabikes eJanis e-bike now</strong></em></a></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9363/mallorca-312-pushed-back-to-october\">Mallorca 312 pushed back to October</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/667/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\">Best smart turbo trainers: Top Zwift compatible indoor trainers</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1634/cap-de-formentor-mallorcas-finest-road\">Cap de Formentor: Mallorca's finest road</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2896/is-mallorca-the-ideal-cycling-location\">Is Mallorca the ideal cycling location? </a></div>    </div></div><h3>Islabikes eJanis specs</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated weight:</td>\n<td>13.5kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame material</td>\n<td>6061 aluminium; Islabikes carbon fork</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Motor</td>\n<td>Mahle Ebikemotion E35, 240W, 40Nm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Battery</td>\n<td>Panasonic 250Wh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stated range</td>\n<td>40-50 miles (64-80km)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Groupset</td>\n<td>Sram GX</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Islabikes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bars</td>\n<td>Aluminium Bar 700mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>Islabikes 700c</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tyres</td>\n<td>Islabikes 700 x 30c </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contact</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.islabikes.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">islabikes.co.uk</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a href=\"/cyclist-reviews-policy\" target=\"_blank\"><em>All reviews are fully independent and no payments have been made by companies featured in reviews</em></a> </p>\n  </div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e7a324c35cb232de7d9f8e17210e64213f57436e6588896daf7091b82cd1aed7","category":"Cycling"}
