He also expects iPhone 13 Pro models to feature an upgraded Ultra Wide camera lens with a wider ƒ/1.8 aperture and autofocus, compared to ƒ/2.4 on iPhone 12 models, as Barclays analysts <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/02/iphone-13-upgraded-ultra-wide-lens-rumor/\">said last month</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo has previously predicted that at least one high-end iPhone model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/05/kuo-iphone-without-lightning-connector-2021/\">would feature a portless design</a> in 2021, but his research note today claims that there will be \"no portless design\" this year after all, with the Lightning connector sticking around.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\"If the iPhone abandons Lightning in the future, it may directly adopt the portless design with MagSafe support instead of using a USB-C port,\" wrote Kuo, noting that USB-C is less waterproof than Lightning. \"At present, the MagSafe ecosystem is not mature enough, so the iPhone will continue to use the Lightning port in the foreseeable future.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAll four iPhone 13 models will feature larger battery capacities compared to iPhone 12 models, according to Kuo, thanks to space-saving design choices such as integrating the SIM card slot with the motherboard and reducing the thickness of some Face ID components.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo said the rear LiDAR Scanner will remain limited to iPhone 13 Pro models, dismissing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/lidar-scanner-on-all-iphone-13-models-rumor/\">a rumor that it would be expanded to more models</a>.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo added that Apple does not plan to release a new iPhone SE <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/\">until the first half of 2022</a>. He siad the new model will have a similar design as the existing 4.7-inch iPhone SE, with key new features including a faster chip and 5G support.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tf-international-securities/\">TF International Securities</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/\">Kuo: iPhone 13 Lineup to Feature Smaller Notch and Larger Batteries, 120Hz Display for Pro Models, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-13-lineup-to-feature-smaller-notch-and-larger-batteries-120hz-display-for-pro-models-and-more.2286658/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3LsP9liYhKE:foneKRfRYBc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=3LsP9liYhKE:foneKRfRYBc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/3LsP9liYhKE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5e10cac12e42bc1e26d11980ebaf72acacda24ec3390217ba3c9ac561ca159e0","category":"Apple"}
