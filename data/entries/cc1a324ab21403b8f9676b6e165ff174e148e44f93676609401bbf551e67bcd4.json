Victoria de Fortunato en el mítico Monte Zoncolan! Grandísima victoria para nuestro equipo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EoloKometaTeam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EoloKometaTeam</a> después de tanto trabajo! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AurumBikes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AurumBikes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/3YIOmo9xA4\">pic.twitter.com/3YIOmo9xA4</a></p>— Alberto Contador (@albertocontador) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/albertocontador/status/1396129049538404352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 22, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>The 2021 Giro d’Italia is EOLO-Kometa’s first appearance at a Grand Tour, having made the step up to UCI ProContinental status only this year. The team is run by two former Giro winners, Ivan Basso and Contador as well as Contador’s brother Fran. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the Giro, the team nearly won stage 8 with Francesco Gavazzi, but the Italian was bested by <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/victor-lafay-takes-giro-ditalia-stage-8-victory-from-the-breakaway/\" target=\"_blank\">Victor Lafay</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given it was EOLO-Kometa’s first professional win, Contador’s reaction is entirely understandable. Before the start of the Giro, Contador promised he would ride from Madrid to Milan, more than 1,600 km if his team won a stage. Well, Alberto, saddle up! Don’t forget to pack some snacks for your upcoming adventure. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/05/contadors-reaction-after-lorenzo-fortunatos-zoncolan-win-is-everything/\">Contador’s reaction after his team’s first Grand Tour stage win is everything</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com\">CyclingTips</a>.</p>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"cc1a324ab21403b8f9676b6e165ff174e148e44f93676609401bbf551e67bcd4","category":"Cycling"}
