That's more than the market capitalization of Facebook, though Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are worth more. Bitcoin's value has almost doubled from $29,000 since the start of the year.</p>\n<p>I say \"in theory\" because not all bitcoins are actually available for use. Each bitcoin (or fraction of a bitcoin) is secured by one or more cryptographic signatures. To transfer a bitcoin, you need to know its corresponding private key. And some of those keys have been lost—and it's impossible to know how many.</p>\n<p>For example, a British man says he threw away a hard drive in 2013 that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/15/uk/bitcoin-trash-landfill-gbr-scli-intl/index.html\">contained the keys</a> to 7,500 bitcoins—worth around $400 million at today's price. He sought permission to excavate the dump containing the hard drive, but the request was denied.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743919#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1743919&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Timothy B.
