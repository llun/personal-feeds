After leaker Jon Prosser debuted the new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-pixel-6-leak-shows-off-distinctive-new-design/\">Pixel 6 design</a> last week, another source has come forward corroborating the design: OnLeaks. The venerable leaker has produced renders for the <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6-renders-design-exclusive/\">Pixel 6</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/exclusive-google-pixel-6-pro-rednders-leak-display-design-camera-59483.html\">Pixel 6 Pro</a> with new details and specs. OnLeaks has an excellent track record with making accurate early renders, especially for Pixel devices. These renders are based on CAD files that OnLeaks has somehow acquired; the files are usually passed around early so accessory manufacturers can be ready for launch.</p>\n<p>OnLeaks says the bigger Pixel 6 (watchers have taken to calling it the \"Pro\" model) has a 6.67-inch display with curved sides on the left and right. Prosser's render does not offer information on the camera system and simply shows three placeholder lenses on the \"Pro\" model. OnLeaks pegs one of the cameras as being a periscope telephoto lens but doesn't have details on the other two. Besides the three cameras and an LED flash, we see three sensors sprinkled around the camera bump, along with one microphone just above the LED flash.</p>\n<p>A normal triple-camera layout would include a main \"wide-angle\" camera, a telephoto camera, and an ultra-wide-angle camera—that's probably a safe assumption here. Those two sensors right above the first two camera lenses also look a lot like the layout for a laser autofocus system.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766582#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1766582&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"510b47f87c56455cfd1b55b58660c7d25c3bbffeef7de4c002a5b43da502c78a","category":"Tech"}
