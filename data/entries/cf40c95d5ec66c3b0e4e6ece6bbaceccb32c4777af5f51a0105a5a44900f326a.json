A roadside spectator was facing the television motorbike, which was ahead of the peloton, while displaying a large cardboard sign that was protruding into the road. Tony Martin, at the head of several Jumbo-Visma riders on the right of the road, slammed into the sign and crashed. His fall caused a domino effect that spread across the width of the road and took numerous riders down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several riders were injured in the crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are filing a complaint against this lady who behaved very badly,” said Tour deputy director Pierre-Yves Thouault, according to the AFP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Let us ensure that the show that has been offered to us is not marred by unacceptable behavior on the part of a tiny minority of the spectators”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ouest-france.fr/tour-de-france/tour-de-france-aso-depose-plainte-contre-la-spectatrice-responsable-de-la-chute-lors-l-etape-f7332fce-d69f-11eb-b1dc-a73451ceafbf\" target=\"_blank\">Ouest-France reports</a> that the spectator left the scene after the incident and remains unidentified.</p>\n\n\n<p></p><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/06/aso-filing-complaint-against-spectator-who-caused-crash-on-tours-opening-stage/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"cf40c95d5ec66c3b0e4e6ece6bbaceccb32c4777af5f51a0105a5a44900f326a","category":"Cycling"}
