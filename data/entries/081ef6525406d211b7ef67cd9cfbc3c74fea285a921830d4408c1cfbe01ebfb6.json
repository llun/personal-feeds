There's also a new SharePlay ‌FaceTime‌ feature that lets Apple users watch TV, listen to music, and share their screens with one another.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nShared With You, a separate feature, keeps track of the music, links, podcasts, news, and photos that people are sent in Messages, highlighting it in the relevant apps. Notes has a new Quick Note feature for jotting down thoughts, and collaboration is easier with mentions and an Activity View.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Shortcuts app from iOS is now available on the Mac, and Focus helps people stay on task by cutting out background distractions. There's an updated Maps app with a whole slew of new features, and with Live Text, Macs can now detect text in photos or provide details on animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in images.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMail Privacy Protection hides IP and prevents tracking through invisible pixels, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> Private Relay keeps Safari browsing protected.
