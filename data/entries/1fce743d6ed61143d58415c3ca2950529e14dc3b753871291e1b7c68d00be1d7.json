That's according to <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2021/GNS_E.pdf\">a Game &amp; Network Services presentation</a> made as part of <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/\">Sony's Investor Relations Day 2021</a>. <em>Uncharted 4</em> is listed in that presentation deck under the heading \"more PC releases planned,\" alongside <em>Days Gone</em>, which <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1259420/\">launched on PC this month</a>.</p>\n<p>On the very same slide, Sony trumpeted the success of another recent PC port of a former PlayStation exclusive, <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em>. Despite some <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/horizon-zero-dawn-on-pc-not-the-optimized-port-we-were-hoping-for/\">iffy performance issues at launch</a>, that port had a 250 percent return on investment through March 2021, according to the presentation (i.e. it earned back its porting budget and an additional 2.5 times that amount). That's not too surprising, considering <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/horizon-zero-dawns-pc-launch-sales-were-nearly-as-large-as-the-witcher-3s/\">previous reports</a> that the PC port sold over 700,000 units in its launch month last August.</p>\n<p>Last year, Sony <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/sony-says-it-will-explore-more-pc-ports-for-playstation-titles/\">said in a corporate report</a> that it \"will explore expanding our first-party titles to the PC platform, in order to promote further growth in our profitability.\" And PlayStation boss Jim Ryan <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/playstation-vr-jim-ryan-interview-2021\">told GQ in February</a> that more games would be coming to PC \"to expose those great games to a wider audience and recognize the economics of game development... also, our ease of making [games] available to non-console owners has grown. So it’s a fairly straightforward decision for us to make.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768029#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1768029&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1fce743d6ed61143d58415c3ca2950529e14dc3b753871291e1b7c68d00be1d7","category":"Tech"}
