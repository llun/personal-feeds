If you’re looking for a way to put your knowledge of pro cycling to good use, or if you just want yet another way to have fun watching what should be a great race, you’ll want to check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules are simple. For each of the 21 stages of the race, you’ll pick one rider for your fantasy squad. At the end of each stage, you’ll get that riders time as well as any points he earned the various classifications of the race. You can only pick a rider once over the course of the race, so you’ll need to be judicious about your picks. New for 2021, we’re capping the maximum amount of time you can lose on any given stage to five minutes – the fantasy peloton won’t be dropping 20 minutes behind a breakaway rider even if that’s the way the day’s real stage plays out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be competing against everyone playing, but you can also form and join mini-leagues to battle for bragging rights with your friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more info or to sign up and play, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021-giro-fantasy-competition/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
