Nevertheless, users who installed the app prior to March 2 can still use it and re-download the app if necessary using their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; purchase history.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/apple-retiring-music-memos-app/\">announced</a> in December that it planned to retire Music Memos after March 1, and advised users to export their Music Memos recordings to the Voice Memos library to ensure that they're saved. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally launched in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/20/apple-music-memos-garageband-2-1/\">January 2016</a>, the app was able to analyze rhythm and chords of acoustic guitar and piano recordings, and instantly add drums and a bass line to provide a virtual, customizable backing band.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nHowever, after improving Voice Memos in step with newer releases of iOS, Apple clearly became less convinced of the utility of also offering the Music Memos app, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/05/28/music-memos-app-gains-notch-support/\">received few updates</a> in the course of its life. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe last update, version 1.0.7, only added the ability to export Music Memos recordings to the Voice Memos library, and Apple now <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211824\">encourages</a> all musicians to use Voice Memos over Music Memos. Apple says that Voice Memos can be used to quickly capture ideas just as easily, and recordings can be taken further with GarageBand.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nExporting Music Memos to Voice Memos requires an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a>, along with the latest versions of Voice Memos and Music Memos.
