The Ohio-based electric truck startup was accused of misleading investors about the extent of its order books, which led to an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission; this in turn led the company to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/lordstown-motors-warns-its-electric-vehicle-business-may-fail/\">issue a \"going concern\" warning</a>, followed by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/electric-work-truck-startup-lordstown-motors-just-lost-its-ceo-and-cfo/\">the departure of its CEO and CFO</a>.</p>\n<p>But on Tuesday, a day after the executive resignations, the company stated that limited production of its Endurance work truck will begin later this year. Lordstown's president Rich Schmidt told journalists at a press event that there were enough \"binding orders\" to fund this limited production until May 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/\">according to Techcrunch</a>.</p>\n<p>Schmidt said that Lordstown has more than $400 million in the bank, but it will need extra investment if it is to produce more than 20,000 EVs or continue operations beyond next May. The company raised $675 million in October 2020 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/lidar-startup-goes-public-makes-founder-a-billionaire/\">after merging with a special-purpose acquisition company</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773989#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1773989&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
