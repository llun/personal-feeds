Now, requiring a premium subscription and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-7/\">watchOS 7</a> or later, Spotify will allow customers to download songs right on their wrist. Spotify already offered users this feature with Fitbit, Samsung Galaxy watches, and other smartwatches. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotify has provided these steps for how to download songs, playlists, albums, and more to the Apple Watch:\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>1. Find the music and podcasts you want to download on your watch. \r\n<br />\r\n2 Select the playlist, album, or podcast and press the three dots (…) and choose “Download to Apple Watch.” \r\n<br />\r\n3. To check on the progress, head over to the Downloads section on the watch. \r\n<br />\r\n4. Once playlists, albums, or podcasts in your library are downloaded, you’ll see a little green arrow next to their names.\r\n<br />\r\n5. Connect your headphones and start listening, no matter where you are!</blockquote>With offline support on the Apple Watch, users can also use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> to play songs right from Spotify, much like on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. Spotify says that offline playback from the Apple Watch will be 96 kbps and that the functionality is rolling out to users in the coming weeks.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/21/spotify-apple-watch-offline-playback/\">Spotify Announces Downloads and Offline Playback on Apple Watch for Premium Subscribers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-announces-downloads-and-offline-playback-on-apple-watch-for-premium-subscribers.2297038/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hrs1xWdEsWc:q1E_dL2tYEk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=hrs1xWdEsWc:q1E_dL2tYEk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/hrs1xWdEsWc\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"66dd6261262c865e6a34e2011229cfa321e3c2d4846ddd0a7b71388640d8911b","category":"Apple"}
