The body is waterproof (IPX7) for the rainiest rides – see current UK weather.</p>\n<p>Common to all Wahoo units, the 'Quick View LEDs' on the top of the screen can serve to provide turn-by-turn directions, alert you to an approaching <a href=\"/tags/strava\">Strava</a> Live segment, provide notifications and indicate heart rate or power zones.</p>\n<p>The new Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II comes with a 15-hour runtime and also boasts an increased onboard memory of 16GB.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/wahoo/9658/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos#12\"><p><span>Image 13 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_v2_gps_cycling_computer_wfcc5_navigtation-reroute_copy_crop.jpg?itok=VsXzNJIw\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 13 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Colour screen</h3>\n<p>Still coming with its own out-front mount, the Bolt II is in the same compact and aerodynamically optimised package of the original but where it's different the changes go from the obvious to the subtle, but all have an impact.</p>\n<p>Starting with the obvious, the new Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II has a colour screen. This is something the brand had avoided until the launch of the larger Roam unit, but the Bolt II's screen is also a step on from its bigger cousin's display.</p>\n<p>For Wahoo, introducing colour screens had to be at a time when the technology was up to the task, which is a position the brand believes it has reached with the launch of the new unit.</p>\n<p>Whereas the Roam will give you blue blobs for bodies of water and mark main roads in yellow, the new Bolt II has gone full technicolour with its 64-colour, high-contrast screen.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/wahoo/9658/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos#14\"><p><span>Image 15 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_v2_gps_cycling_computer_wfcc5_bolt_faceupanglednondrive-nomount_crop.jpg?itok=uCfPXyt3\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 15 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>On the Data Fields page, metrics such as heart rate and power appear in the colour that corresponds to their training zones, a much simpler way to see how you're getting on when you glance down at the unit.</p>\n<p>As Wahoo puts it, 'an updated user interface offers customisable, colour-highlighted fields to make it simple to focus on specific data metrics. An ambient light sensor automatically adjusts the backlight to make sure that the screen is always easy to see, even on dawn commutes or dusky rides.'</p>\n<p>The colour screen sits behind scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass and even the font of some of the on-screen notifications has been improved making the words easier to read.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/elemnt-bolt-buy\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II now</strong></em></a></p>\n<h3>Glove-friendly buttons</h3>\n<p>The original Bolt, and the Roam for that matter, has concave buttons on the front of the unit that sometimes require a bit of convincing when pushed – especially with winter gloves on.</p>\n<p>On the new Bolt II the buttons are convex, standing slightly above the height of the unit's fascia. With the temperature struggling to reach double figures on my morning rides despite it being May, my digits haven't yet been exposed to the wind. As such, the improvement in the buttons has been obvious and welcome.</p>\n<p>Much easier to push and a lot more responsive as a result, this is an improvement that couldn't have been thought of sat at a desk but must have become obvious to Wahoo during ride-testing of the new Bolt II.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/wahoo/9658/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos#15\"><p><span>Image 16 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_v2_gps_cycling_computer_wfcc5_bolt-navigtation-route-tbt_copy_crop.jpg?itok=vAqyWdxT\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 16 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>Smart navigation</h3>\n<p>The Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II also steals Smart Navigation from the Roam, meaning it automatically re-routes if you stray from any planned course.</p>\n<p>It also allows you to change destinations, route back to the start and retrace your rides right from the computer – importantly, without having to use the smartphone app.</p>\n<h3>Bolt II vs Roam</h3>\n<p>'The Bolt is designed to make exploring simple with millions of miles of roads and trails already preloaded,' says Wahoo. 'When paired with the Wahoo Elemnt app, riders can easily customise their data screens, sync routes and analyse data.'</p>\n<p>Which all sounds great and is what anyone would want from a GPS bike computer. However, this opens up a debate similar to that of the Specialized Tarmac vs the Specialized Venge.</p>\n<p>That argument was settled quite recently when the middle of the Venn diagram became large enough for the Venge to be discontinued. Could the Roam go the same way if the Bolt II encroaches far enough onto its navigation turf?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/elemnt-bolt-buy\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>When asked, Wahoo was dismissive of the idea, contesting that the larger screen on the Roam meant it held appeal for tourers and adventurer riders in a way that the smaller package of the Bolt simply doesn't.</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to the next generation Roam, whenever that might appear, if it brings the improvements to the colour screen and navigation that this new Bolt II has.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/wahoo/9658/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos#19\"><p><span>Image 20 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_wfcc5_rival_-_bolt_25_crop.jpg?itok=6_XtYlZ9\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 20 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1803/giro-ditalia-2021-route-riders-start-list-live-tv\">Giro d'Italia 2021: Full details for this year's race plus daily photo galleries</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/8760/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia-2021\">How to watch and live stream the Giro d'Italia 2021</a></div>    </div></div><h3>First ride review</h3>\n<p>Attached to a stem-top mount rather than the aero out-front, I've used the new Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II only a few times since it arrived last week and only once on a 'proper' ride. Regardless, first impressions are very good.</p>\n<p>I'm already familiar with Wahoo's products having used the original Bolt, the Roam and a number of accessories such as the Tickr heart rate monitor, so this wasn't a new introduction to the brand or the product.</p>\n<p>Comparing the new Bolt II to its predecessor and its larger cousin, the improvements are obvious and in some cases very welcome.</p>\n<p>The most welcome in the improvement of the buttons, now easy to push with gloves or cold fingers, making it much simpler to toggle between screens on the unit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/elemnt-bolt-buy\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>The colour screen is a leap on from the original Bolt and even from the more recent Roam. The latter brings some colour and tone while the new Bolt II is like a kaleidoscope of welcome colour.</p>\n<p>The maps are clearer and much improved by the 64-colour display and the colour coding of metrics on the data fields screen, letting you know your current output from a paired power meter or heart rate monitor, makes it much easier to gauge your effort from a quick glance down at the Bolt II.</p>\n<p>I'll be following routes on the unit and trying to see if I agree with Wahoo's assertion that this town is big enough for the both of the Bolt II and the Roam, with an in-depth review to follow. </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/wahoo/9658/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos\">Wahoo Elemnt Bolt II photos</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>24 May 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fwahoo%2F9658%2Fwahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Wahoo%20Elemnt%20Bolt%20II%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fwahoo%2F9658%2Fwahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Wahoo%20Elemnt%20Bolt%20II%20photos%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fwahoo%2F9658%2Fwahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Wahoo%20Elemnt%20Bolt%20II%20photos&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fwahoo%2F9658%2Fwahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/wahoo/9658/wahoo-elemnt-bolt-ii-photos#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/05/wahoo_elemnt_bolt_v2_gps_cycling_computer_wfcc5_detail_pov_map_crop.jpg?itok=BJG6tGEo\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/gps-bike-computers\">GPS bike computers</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/tags/wahoo\">Wahoo</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"jackew","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0883f7e1325bd4fbfe13773c6762c886e560bfcfa679a009440d95bd1b21c381","category":"Cycling"}
