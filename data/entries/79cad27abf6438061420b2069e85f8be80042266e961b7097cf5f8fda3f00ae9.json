Though Apple has also made efforts to improve its podcast offerings, Apple Podcasts has been losing listener share.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/spotify-apple-music.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"470\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786400\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIn 2018, Apple Podcasts represented 34 percent of podcast listeners, a metric that will fall to 23.8 in 2021. Spotify's rise in popularity can be attributed to Apple's failure to match Spotify's pace of investment and innovation in the podcasting space, according to eMarketer analyst Peter Vahle.<blockquote>\"By putting podcasts and music in one place, Spotify quickly became the convenient one-stop-shop for everything digital audio,\" said eMarketer forecasting analyst at Insider Intelligence Peter Vahle. \"Apple was the de facto destination for podcasts for a long time, but in recent years, it has not kept up with Spotify's pace of investment and innovation in podcast content and technology. Spotify's investments have empowered podcast creators and advertisers through its proprietary hosting, creation, and monetization tools.\"</blockquote>Apple is working to counter Spotify's deep investments in podcasting with its own original content. Apple recently debuted the first podcast based on \"For All Mankind,\" one of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> shows, and more TV-related content is expected to come out.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRumors suggest that Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/21/apple-exclusive-original-podcast-content/\">working to purchase</a> exclusive original podcasts for the Podcasts app, with those original podcasts also perhaps serving as inspiration for future television content.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAs of November, Apple allows Apple Podcasts to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/16/apple-podcasts-web-embeds-now-available/\">embedded on the web</a> to increase visibility, and in January, Apple launched a new Podcasts Spotlight feature to highlight <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/19/apple-podcasts-spotlight-launches/\">rising podcast creators</a>. Apple is also said to be working on a podcast subscription service to better allow it to compete with Spotify by luring content creators with the promise of more money.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt's worth noting that eMarketer's analysis is based on estimated podcast listeners, and there is no concrete data available from Apple on the number of people in the United States who are listening to podcasts.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/podcasts/\">Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/02/spotify-surpass-apple-podcasts-us-listeners/\">Spotify Poised to Surpass Apple Podcasts in U.S. Listeners This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-poised-to-surpass-apple-podcasts-in-u-s-listeners-this-year.2286797/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eggG0gjMHHY:RjcdyCzfB8o:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=eggG0gjMHHY:RjcdyCzfB8o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/eggG0gjMHHY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79cad27abf6438061420b2069e85f8be80042266e961b7097cf5f8fda3f00ae9","category":"Apple"}
