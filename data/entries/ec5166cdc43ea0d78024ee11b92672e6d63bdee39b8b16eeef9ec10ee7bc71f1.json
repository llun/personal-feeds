{"title":"Kuo: AirPods 3 Mass Production to Start in Q3 2021","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/","date":1615791345000,"content":"Mass production will begin on the third-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> in the third quarter of 2021, according to an investors note from analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> that was seen by <em>MacRumors.</em> \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/AirPods-Gen-3-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-779632\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nIf mass production is not set to begin until the third quarter of 2021, it would mean that the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 wouldn't ship until later in the year. Kuo previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/13/kuo-ipad-mini-led-airpods-3-coming-1h21/\">said back in November</a> that the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 would launch in the first half of 2021, and other rumors have suggested the new &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; could come as soon as this month.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThere have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">several leaks</a> depicting the redesigned third-generation &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;, which normally suggests that a launch is close, and Kang, a well-respected leaker who often shares accurate information about Apple's plans, said recently that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/new-airpods-ready-to-ship-kang/\">the AirPods 3</a> are \"ready to ship.\"  \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo expects &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; shipments from the first quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2021 to decline by about 25 percent year over year to 55 million units. Should demand for the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 be better than expected, fourth quarter &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; shipments will remain flat year over year at 23 million units. Overall &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; shipments across 2021 are expected to decline to 78 million units, down from 90 million in 2020.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nKuo says that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> have offered \"limited help\" to &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; shipments, with an annual shipment of about one million units. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is unclear at this time if &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2 will stop being produced when the &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 enter mass production. Kuo says that Apple has a dilemma -- if &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2 stick around and are sold at a lower price, it could affect &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3 demand, but if there's a no low-priced &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; model, it could have a negative effect on Apple's sales.<blockquote>If &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2 will go to end-of-life after &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3's mass production, we estimate &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2, and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; will account for about 40%, 28%, 31%, and 1% of total shipments, respectively, in 2021. If &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2 will continue production after mass production of &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3, we estimate &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 3, &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2, and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; will account for about 32%, 28%, 39%, and 1% of total shipments in 2021, respectively.</blockquote>Kuo attributes the decline in &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; shipments to increased competition and a loss of market share. There are a number of lower-priced true wireless earbud options on the market for Apple to contend with.<blockquote>The competitive advantage of Apple's products lies in providing integration of the \"hardware, software, and service\" ecosystem, not just hardware. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, for example, has seen its market share decline due to the rapid growth of the smartphone market, but it has been able to maintain shipment growth because of the strong ecosystem of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> and developers. We believe that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> is the core of &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;' software and service ecosystem, but since &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s competitive advantage is not significant, the gap between &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj;' leading edge and its competitors' shrinks due to a lack of protection from the ecosystem as competitors gradually improve their user experience and launch lower-price strategies at the same time. We believe that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> shipments were significantly lower than expected for the same reason.</blockquote>&zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; have quick pairing and fast switching capabilities that give them an edge over competitors, but Kuo says that these advantages are \"gradually offset\" by improved user experiences and lower prices offered by competitors. <blockquote>In terms of high quality, while &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;'s low latency is about 50% improvement vs. &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 1 and 20% improvement vs. &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; 2, and it offers active noise cancellation, sales results show that consumers are not very willing to spend more than US&#36;100 to buy the selling points of &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.</blockquote>Kuo says that if Apple wants to improve &zwnj;AirPods&zwnj; shipments in the future, hardware innovation like health management functionality is necessary to differentiate the earbuds from similar products offered by competitors. <div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/\">AirPods 3</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/\">Kuo: AirPods 3 Mass Production to Start in Q3 2021</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-airpods-3-mass-production-to-start-in-q3-2021.2288335/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GurNmdJ5Ta8:8bGUY1ngq20:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GurNmdJ5Ta8:8bGUY1ngq20:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GurNmdJ5Ta8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec5166cdc43ea0d78024ee11b92672e6d63bdee39b8b16eeef9ec10ee7bc71f1","category":"Apple"}
