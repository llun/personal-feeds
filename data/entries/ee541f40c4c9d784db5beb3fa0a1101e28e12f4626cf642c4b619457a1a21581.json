This week, it's finally making the rounds thanks to recent Reddit and YouTube shares, and as of press time, Microsoft has yet to block this method of accessing Xbox's game-streaming service on your PC. It requires accessing and downloading a Windows app that is otherwise buried in an official Microsoft database, then using a one-time unlock phrase to get it functioning.</p>\n<p>But the steps are simple and safe enough, as I've tested, to recommend it to anyone eager to test Xbox's streaming option on their favorite Win10 laptop or desktop—and to finally see how Xbox Game Streaming (formerly known as Project xCloud) performs on wired Ethernet connections.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754345#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754345&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ee541f40c4c9d784db5beb3fa0a1101e28e12f4626cf642c4b619457a1a21581","category":"Tech"}
