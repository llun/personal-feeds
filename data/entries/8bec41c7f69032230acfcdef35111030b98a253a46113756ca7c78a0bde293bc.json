Together with his collaborators, he has devised a way for humans to \"enter\" a 3D spider web and explore its structure both visually and aurally via a virtual reality setup. Buehler described the ongoing project during a talk at the (virtual) meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) this week.</p>\n<p>The work may one day lead to a means of rudimentary communication with spiders in their own \"language\" of web vibrations, such as when they stretch a strand of silk while building a web or when the strands vibrate in response to a gust of wind or to the presence of trapped prey. \"The spider lives in an environment of vibrating strings,\" Buehler said during an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWM7Xgbh2Ps&amp;list=PLLG7h7fPoH8KNYDUd6icIvRwl0OBg79RN&amp;index=7\">online press conference</a>. \"They don't see very well, so they sense their world through vibrations, which have different frequencies.\"</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/amino-acids-make-beautiful-music-to-design-novel-protein-structures/\">we've reported previously</a>, several years ago, Buehler led a team of MIT scientists that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/510726/setting-silk-to-music/\">mapped the molecular structure</a> of proteins <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2012/the-music-of-the-silks-1128\">in spider silk</a> threads onto musical theory to produce <a href=\"http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2012/11/scientists-build-silk-and-then-listen.html\">the \"sound\" of silk</a> in hopes of establishing a radical new way to create designer proteins. The hierarchical elements of music composition (pitch, range, dynamics, tempo) are analogous to the hierarchical elements of a protein structure. Much like how music has a limited number of notes and chords and uses different combinations to compose music, proteins have a limited number of building blocks (20 amino acids) that can combine in any number of ways to create novel protein structures with unique properties.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756655#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1756655&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8bec41c7f69032230acfcdef35111030b98a253a46113756ca7c78a0bde293bc","category":"Tech"}
