The full report should be published by tomorrow with additional details.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and other sources have claimed that iPhone 13 models will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/iphone-13-mmwave-more-countries-kuo/\">support ultra-fast mmWave 5G bands in additional countries</a>, with likely candidates including Canada, Japan, Australia, and some European countries. By comparison, mmWave support on iPhone 12 models is limited to the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nmmWave is a set of 5G frequencies that promise ultra-fast speeds at short distances, which is suitable for dense urban areas. By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we tested Verizon's mmWave network with a Samsung smartphone in Chicago in mid-2019, we were able to hit download speeds of close to 2Gb/s, but speeds vary drastically based on your position and proximity to the nearest 5G tower.
